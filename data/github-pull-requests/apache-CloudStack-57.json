the ticket:\n\nIn the base.py file, there is a Host class with a delete instance method.\n\nThis method first attempts to transition the host into the maintenance resource state.\n\nThe first step in this process is to transition the host into the prepare-for-maintenance resource state.\n\nA while later, the host can be transitioned completely into the maintenance resource state.\n\nIn an attempt to wait for this transition to occur, the delete method has a timer.sleep(30) call.\n\nThe hope is that the host will have transitioned from the prepare-for-maintenance resource state to the maintenance resource state within 30 seconds, but this does not always happen.\n\nWe should correct this problem by putting in logic to query the management server for the resource state of the host. If it's in the expected state, move on; else, sleep for a bit and try again (up to a certain

PR addresses CLOUDSTACK-9339 and may need a code review from someone familiar with the System VM scripts. In particular, this PR has not been tested in a VPC RvR context. Only standalone routers and RvR routers have been demonstrated.\n- **d582358: Leave public interfaces down in backup redundant routers.** Previously backup routers were bringing all interfaces up and thus arping public IPs away from the master router.\n- **9ee1eb6: Add the default gateway to the main routing table when interfaces are configured.** The gateway for the first public IP was always being added to the main routing table. Sometimes a router would consequently add the gateway for an IP other than the default source-NAT IP. This would prevent outbound connectivity for guest VMs.\n- **ad9d72f: Add default gateway to device-specific routing tables.** Link-level routes were being put into the device-specific routing tables (accessed via firewall marks) but these are unnecessary. Instead, the default gateway is needed to allow the kernel to make an appropriate routing decision.\n- **8db879e: Only mark guest connections when they are part of a static-NAT.** Guest connections were being marked with a zero. This added no functionality and prevented static-NAT rules from routing outbound traffic properly as device-specific routing tables would not be used. Instead, all traffic would be routed out via the default public interface.\n- **788b1be: Allow forwarding and collect network stats on any public interface.** Forwarding rules and network stats were limited to eth2 on RvR networks. This needed to be decoupled from eth2 and reapplied to whichever interface was under consideration.\n- **b19e8aa: Ensure that CONNMARK --restore-mark only appears once.** This is a bit of a hack and can do with being improved. The CONNMARK rule was not being picked up by the de-duplication logic in CsNetfilter and was being added twice. This caused checksum errors on packets traversing NAT.\n- **bf285e1: Transition to master state should add all necessary routes.** Now that backup routers keep their interfaces down, the route logic executed at configuration-time cannot be applied. Instead, once the interface is brought up during a transition to master, routers must re-evaluate what routes are needed and add them. Unfortunately I couldn't see a way to re-use the existing route logic with the variables that I had in scope so there is some duplication. In some cases, routers did not successfully arp IPs away from the old master so some arp logic was added. During a failover most connections with guest VMs will be maintained with only minor packet loss. SSH sessions implemented via port-forwarding rules on an interface other than the source-NAT interface consistently get dropped, however, so the failover isn't quite seamless. It's possible that there's an easy fix for that.\n\nI expect that a number of tests may need to be modified/written as part of this PR. Any feedback or pointers would be useful as initially I'll be relying on the CI failures to tell me where to

Description\n\nJIRA TICKET: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-9368\nThis pull request address a problem introduced in #1361 in which NFS version couldn't be changed after hosts resources were configured on startup (for hosts using `VmwareResource`), and as host parameters didn't include `nfs.version` key, it was set `null`.\n## Proposed solution\n\nIn this proposed solution `nfsVersion` would be passed in `NfsTO` through `CopyCommand` to `VmwareResource`, who will check if NFS version is still configured or not. If not, it will use the one sent in the command and will set it to its storage processor and storage handler. After those setups, it will proceed executing command.\n","created_at":"2016-04-25T12:40:27Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T13:25:07Z","closed_at":"2016-05-26T03:06:02Z","merged_at":"2016-05-26T03:06:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"2d2819974eb44928599053445bc5b2876c9102e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1518/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1518/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1518/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/2d2819974eb44928599053445bc5b2876c9102e5","head":{"label":"nvazquez:testnfs","ref":"testnfs","sha":"2d2819974eb44928599053445bc5b2876c9102e5","user":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40547252,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDU0NzI1Mg==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"nvazquez/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

this issue when using MySQL 5.7 with Ubuntu 16.04. The upgrade path fix removes an invalid `IGNORE` param that is deprecated now, in the upgrade path we run the alter statement to add an index only if it does not exist so we're good.\n\nFor MySQL 5.7, we'll also need to update the docs at some point to include `server-id` along with other parameters. Some of the SQL statements used throughout engine/schema don't adhere to SQL 99 standard which is enforced by default in MySQL 5.7, therefore the following sql-mode (for backward compatibility with mysql 5.6 modes) will be necessary for anyone willing to use MySQL 5.7 (until we fix codebase wide raw and generated sql statements to be SQL99 compliant):\n\nsql-mode=\"STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_ZERO_DATE,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION\"\nserver-id   = 1\ninnodb_rollback_on_timeout=1\ninnodb_lock_wait_timeout=600\nmax_connections=350\nlog-bin=mysql-bin\nbinlog-format = 'ROW'\n\n/cc @swill @jburwell @agneya2001 @wido @DaanHoogland  and others\n","created_at":"2016-04-25T09:26:50Z","updated_at":"2016-04-28T20:07:07Z","closed_at":"2016-04-28T20:07:07Z","merged_at":"2016-04-28T20:07:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"c63ea0a240df0c5af2802b424d70083bbfd0e919","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1517/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1517/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1517/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/c63ea0a240df0c5af2802b424d70083bbfd0e919","head":{"label":"shapeblue:mysql-5.7-upgradefix","ref":"mysql-5.7-upgradefix","sha":"c63ea0a240df0c5af2802b424d70083bbfd0e919","user":{"login":"shapeblue","id":6001764,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYwMDE3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6001764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue","html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35481491,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTQ4MTQ5MQ==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"shapeblue/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shapeblue","id":6001764,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYwMDE3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6001764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue","html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue/cloudstack","description":"The upstream repository is at http://github.com/apache/cloudstack.

and Remove Host operation disables the primary storage capacity.\n\nSteps to replicate:\nBase Condition: There exists a host and storage pool with same id\nSteps:\n1. Find a host and storage pool having same id\n2. Disable the host\n3. CPU(1) and MEMORY(0) capacity in op_host_capacity for above host is disabled\n4. STORAGE(3) capacity in op_host_capacity for storage pool with id same as above host is also disabled\n\nRCA:\n'host_id' column in 'op_host_capacity' table used for storing both storage pool id (for STORAGE capacity) and host id (MEMORY and CPU). While disabling a HOST we also disable the capacity associated with host.\n\nIdeally while disabling capacity we should only disable MEMORY and CPU capacity, but we are not doing so.\n\nCode Path:\nResourceManagerImpl.doDeleteHost() -> ResourceManagerImpl.resourceStateTransitTo() -> CapacityDaoImpl.updateCapacityState(null, null, null, host.getId(), capacityState.toString())\n\nupdateCapacityState is updating disabling all entries which matches the host_id. This will also disable a entry having storage pool id same as that of host id.\n\nChanges:\nintroduced new capacityType parameter in updateCapacityState method and necessary changes to add capacity_type clause in sql\nalso fixed incorrect sql builder logic (unused code path for which it is never surfaced )\nAdded marvin test to  check host and storagepool capacity when host is disabled\n\nTest Result:\n\n```\nBefore Fix:\nmysql> select ohc.host_id, ohc.`capacity_state`,  case capacity_type  when 0 then  'MEMORY'  when 1 then  'CPU'  ELSE  'STORAGE'  END as 'capacity_type' ,  total_capacity, case capacity_type  when 0 then  'HOST'  when 1 then  'HOST' ELSE  'STORAGE POOL' END as 'HOST/STORAGE POOL'  from op_host_capacity ohc where host_id=3;\n+---------+----------------+---------------+----------------+-------------------+\n| host_id | capacity_state | capacity_type | total_capacity | HOST/STORAGE POOL |\n+---------+----------------+---------------+----------------+-------------------+\n|       3 | Enabled        | MEMORY        |     8589934592 | HOST              |\n|       3 | Enabled        | CPU           |          32000 | HOST              |\n|       3 | Enabled        | STORAGE       |  2199023255552 | STORAGE POOL      |\n+---------+----------------+---------------+----------------+-------------------+\n\n9 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n\nDisable Host 3 from UI.\n\nmysql> select ohc.host_id, ohc.`capacity_state`,  case capacity_type  when 0 then  'MEMORY'  when 1 then  'CPU'  ELSE  'STORAGE'  END as 'capacity_type' ,  total_capacity, case capacity_type  when 0 then  'HOST'  when 1 then  'HOST' ELSE  'STORAGE POOL' END as 'HOST/STORAGE POOL'  from op_host_capacity ohc where host_id=3;\n+---------+----------------+---------------+----------------+-------------------+\n| host_id | capacity_state | capacity_type | total_capacity | HOST/STORAGE POOL |\n+---------+----------------+---------------+----------------+-------------------+\n|       3 | Disabled       | MEMORY        |     8589934592 | HOST              |\n|       3 | Disabled       | CPU           |          32000 | HOST              |\n|       3 | Disabled       | STORAGE       |  2199023255552 | STORAGE POOL      |\n+---------+----------------+---------------+----------------+-------------------+\n\nAfter Fix:\n\nmysql> select ohc.host_id, ohc.`capacity_state`,  case capacity_type  when 0 then  'MEMORY'  when 1 then  'CPU'  ELSE  'STORAGE'  END as 'capacity_type' ,  total_capacity, case capacity_type  when 0 then  'HOST'  when 1 then  'HOST' ELSE  'STORAGE POOL' END as 'HOST/STORAGE POOL'  from op_host_capacity ohc where host_id=3;\n+---------+----------------+---------------+----------------+-------------------+\n| host_id | capacity_state | capacity_type | total_capacity | HOST/STORAGE POOL |\n+---------+----------------+---------------+----------------+-------------------+\n|       3 | Enabled        | MEMORY        |     8589934592 | HOST              |\n|       3 | Enabled        | CPU           |          32000 | HOST              |\n|       3 | Enabled        | STORAGE       |  2199023255552 | STORAGE POOL      |\n+---------+----------------+---------------+----------------+-------------------+\n3 rows in set (0.01 sec)\n\nDisable Host 3 from UI.\n\nmysql> select ohc.host_id, ohc.`capacity_state`,  case capacity_type  when 0 then  'MEMORY'  when 1 then  'CPU'  ELSE  'STORAGE'  END as 'capacity_type' ,  total_capacity, case capacity_type  when 0 then  'HOST'  when 1 then  'HOST' ELSE  'STORAGE POOL' END as 'HOST/STORAGE POOL'  from op_host_capacity ohc where host_id=3;\n+---------+----------------+---------------+----------------+-------------------+\n| host_id | capacity_state | capacity_type | total_capacity | HOST/STORAGE POOL |\n+---------+----------------+---------------+----------------+-------------------+\n|       3 | Disabled       | MEMORY        |     8589934592 | HOST              |\n|       3 | Disabled       | CPU           |          32000 | HOST              |\n|       3 | Enabled        | STORAGE       |  2199023255552 | STORAGE POOL      |\n+---------+----------------+---------------+----------------+-------------------+\n3 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n\n\nSudhansus-MAC:cloudstack sudhansu$  nosetests-2.7 --with-marvin --marvin-config=setup/dev/advanced.cfg test/integration/component/maint/test_capacity_host_delete.py \n\n==== Marvin Init Started ====\n\n=== Marvin Parse Config Successful ===\n\n=== Marvin Setting TestData Successful===\n\n==== Log Folder Path: /tmp//MarvinLogs//Apr_22_2016_22_42_27_X4VBWD.

of PR #1509 against the 4.7 branch as requested by @swill \n\nOne LGTM from @ustcweizhou carried from previous PR. Previous PR will be closed.\n\nDescription from PR #1509:\n\nCLOUDSTACK-6975 refers to service monitoring bringing up dnsmasq but this is no-longer accurate, as service monitoring is not active on the post-4.6 routers. These routers still suffer an essentially identical issue, however, because \"dnsmasq needs to be restarted each time configure.py is called in order to avoid lease problems.\" As such, dnsmasq is still running on backup RvRs, causing the issues described in CLOUDSTACK-6975.\n\nThis PR is based on a patch submitted by @ustcweizhou. The code now checks the redundant state of the router before restarting dnsmasq.\n\nRvR networks without this patch have dnsmasq running on both master and backup routers. RvR networks with this patch have dnsmasq running on only the master router.\n","created_at":"2016-04-22T15:03:17Z","updated_at":"2016-05-26T02:53:36Z","closed_at":"2016-05-26T02:53:36Z","merged_at":"2016-05-26T02:53:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"38b3bdd488745b3ded6d54ae2d3093842bc4d763","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1514/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1514/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1514/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/38b3bdd488745b3ded6d54ae2d3093842bc4d763","head":{"label":"QuiteClose:CLOUDSTACK-6975","ref":"CLOUDSTACK-6975","sha":"38b3bdd488745b3ded6d54ae2d3093842bc4d763","user":{"login":"QuiteClose","id":103378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzM3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose","html_url":"https://github.com/QuiteClose","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45899178,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTg5OTE3OA==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"QuiteClose/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"QuiteClose","id":103378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzM3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose","html_url":"https://github.com/QuiteClose","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/QuiteClose/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

refers to service monitoring bringing up dnsmasq but this is no-longer accurate, as service monitoring is not active on the post-4.6 routers. These routers still suffer an essentially identical issue, however, because \"dnsmasq needs to be restarted each time configure.py is called in order to avoid lease problems.\" As such, dnsmasq is still running on backup RvRs, causing the issues described in CLOUDSTACK-6975.\n\nThis PR is based on a patch submitted by @ustcweizhou. The code now checks the redundant state of the router before restarting dnsmasq.\n\nRvR networks without this patch have dnsmasq running on both master and backup routers. RvR networks with this patch have dnsmasq running on only the master router.\n","created_at":"2016-04-22T08:55:18Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T15:09:52Z","closed_at":"2016-04-22T15:03:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d09bbe86cdd6488d0926e9dcf78fcaf11f24b911","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1509/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1509/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1509/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/cb16ce7e6c8197ae289d105bbf829c68db6d5086","head":{"label":"QuiteClose:CLOUDSTACK-6975","ref":"CLOUDSTACK-6975","sha":"cb16ce7e6c8197ae289d105bbf829c68db6d5086","user":{"login":"QuiteClose","id":103378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzM3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose","html_url":"https://github.com/QuiteClose","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45899178,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTg5OTE3OA==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"QuiteClose/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"QuiteClose","id":103378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzM3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose","html_url":"https://github.com/QuiteClose","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuiteClose/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/QuiteClose/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

rewriting of bridge device names when migrating a virtual machine from one host to another. However, it also matches bridges called \"brvx-1234\" and rewrites them to (in my case) \"brem1-1234\" - this doesn't match the bridge name on the destination and causes the migration to fail with the error:\n> \n> error : virNetDevGetMTU:397 : Cannot get interface MTU on 'brem1-1234': No such device\n> \n> I have flagged this as major because it's not possible to migrate VMs using VXLANs for maintenance, which seems important (it's certainly important to me!).\n","created_at":"2016-04-21T14:28:28Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T14:03:35Z","closed_at":"2016-04-22T14:03:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1389ae1cd2689f439091fb065afdd28517d79f26","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1508/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1508/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1508/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/bbd204c45632e1037e6c71e70593dfe10c80c4a5","head":{"label":"insom:CLOUDSTACK-9362","ref":"CLOUDSTACK-9362","sha":"bbd204c45632e1037e6c71e70593dfe10c80c4a5","user":{"login":"insom","id":500844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMDg0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/500844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/insom","html_url":"https://github.com/insom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54557665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDU1NzY2NQ==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"insom/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"insom","id":500844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMDg0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/500844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/insom","html_url":"https://github.com/insom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/insom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/insom/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/339355594ca537ebbc8e0a0f6e49a63ee4b884ac/server/src/com/cloud/api/ApiServer.java#L270\n\nThe `substring()` method throws a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when `cmdEventType` is the last field in the JSON object.\n\nThe JSON object being the JSON serialization of a `HashMap` object, the order of the fields is not guaranteed. In my tests, I observed that there is no error with Java 7, but it fails with Java 8, which has a different Hashmap implementation.\n\nFor example, with request http://127.0.0.1:8096/client/api?command=stopVirtualMachine&id=734ef752-fe99-4d46-8f31-18130496473c, cmdInfo is:\n\n```\n{\"ctxUserId\":\"1\",\"httpmethod\":\"GET\",\"ctxStartEventId\":\"105\",\"id\":\"734ef752-fe99-4d46-8f31-18130496473c\",\"ctxDetails\":\"{\\\"interface com.cloud.vm.VirtualMachine\\\":\\\"734ef752-fe99-4d46-8f31-18130496473c\\\"}\",\"ctxAccountId\":\"1\",\"uuid\":\"734ef752-fe99-4d46-8f31-18130496473c\",\"cmdEventType\":\"VM.STOP\"}\n```\n\nand it fails.\n\nPlease note that the error is not present for all API requests, depending on the parameters fields.\n","created_at":"2016-04-20T14:18:54Z","updated_at":"2017-03-16T16:28:13Z","closed_at":"2016-05-26T03:06:02Z","merged_at":"2016-05-26T03:06:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"61d2692597dd9219862573933957f0da504acb42","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1503/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1503/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1503/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/61d2692597dd9219862573933957f0da504acb42","head":{"label":"apalia:fix-CLOUDSTACK-9358","ref":"fix-CLOUDSTACK-9358","sha":"61d2692597dd9219862573933957f0da504acb42","user":{"login":"apalia","id":77301595,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc3MzAxNTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77301595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia","html_url":"https://github.com/apalia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":56692761,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NjY5Mjc2MQ==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apalia/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apalia","id":77301595,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc3MzAxNTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77301595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia","html_url":"https://github.com/apalia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apalia/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

access to a host’s out-of-band management interface (e.g. IPMI, iLO,\nDRAC, etc.) to manage host power operations (on/off etc.) and querying current\npower state in CloudStack.\n\nGiven the wide range of out-of-band management interfaces such as iLO and iDRA,\nthe service implementation allows for development of separate drivers as plugins.\nThis feature comes with a ipmitool based driver that uses the\nipmitool (http://linux.die.net/man/1/ipmitool) to communicate with any\nout-of-band management interface that support IPMI 2.0.\n\nThis feature allows following common use-cases:\n- Restarting stalled/failed hosts\n- Powering off under-utilised hosts\n- Powering on hosts for provisioning or to increase capacity\n- Allowing system administrators to see the current power state of the host\n\nFor testing this feature, please install `ipmitool` (using yum/apt/brew) and `ipmisim`:\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/ipmisim\n\nThe default ipmitool location is assumed in /usr/bin, if this is different in your env please fix the global setting, see FS for details on various global

PR addresses the KVM detach/attach ROOT disks from VMs (CLOUDSTACK-9349).  In short, this allows the KVM Hypervisor, and I added the Simulator as a valid hypervisor for ease of development and testing of marvin, to detach a root volume and the reattach a root volume using the deviceid=0 flag to the attachVolume API.  I have also written a marvin integration test that verifies this feature works for both KVM and the Simulator.\n\nBelow is the marvin results files of the full marvin test_volumes.py.  All tests pass, including the new root detach/attach, on our KVM lab running with the patches in this

in process of rewriting the unit test for this class' mount method. Before I can do that, the class needed some refactoring, not just because it was fuzzy but because it was impossible to use mocks the way it was coded. Most of this PR is about transforming big chunks of code into documented methods with two exceptions:\r\n\r\n1) I inverted the logic when checking for existing mounts within the same root location. Previously one would first create a directory if it didn't exist and then test if there was already mount there. Now it is first testing if there is a mount, if not, it creates the needed directory. (line 2376)\r\n\r\n2) A bug was found in the unmount method. The unmount wasn't issuing the command \"umount\" to unmount a resource but instead was trying the \"mount\" command again, resulting in mounted resources never being unmounted. (line 2347)\r\n\r\n**[UPDATE] Instead of refactoring the `umount` method, I noticed that it was not being used. Therefore, instead of fixing it, I decided to remove it.**\r\n","created_at":"2016-04-18T03:33:39Z","updated_at":"2019-01-09T21:41:52Z","closed_at":"2019-01-09T21:41:52Z","merged_at":"2019-01-09T21:41:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"301330528cfd27beefc94615a94d5d560b26f600","assignee":{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":821716113,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjE3MTYxMTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:cleanup","name":"type:cleanup","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/4/labels","id":3009550,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzAwOTU1MA==","number":4,"title":"4.12.0.0","description":"Milestone for PRs targetted for the next major 4.12.0.0 release.

separator in windows (\"\\\") is different from the expected in the test (\"/\"); thus, the test _com.cloud.utils.SwiftUtilTest.testSplitSwiftPath()_ will fail in Windows systems.\n\nThe problem is that the input of the test is \"_container/object_\" but the tested method uses the _File.separator_ (that depends from the OS), in windows systems the tested method (_com.cloud.utils.SwiftUtil.splitSwiftPath(String)_) looks for a \"\\\", as the string does not contain \"\\\" it returns an empty string and consequently results in a test failure.\n\n**Solution:**\nCreate a string `String input = \"container\" + File.separator + \"object\";`, with that the test will validate the tested method verifying if the method splits the string around matches of the given regular expression (in this case _File.separator_).\n\n_JIRA link:

all,\n\nWe've remodeled the Nuage VSP plugin to use the same model as VMWare is using (non-OSS). Before, we had a runtime dependency to the Nuage Client, this has been changed to a compile-time dependency instead because of multiple reasons (build management, readability, maintainability, ...)\n\nWe've adapted the code so it now uses model objects defined in the Nuage client instead of passing a list of parameters to the Nuage client. This is a lot more readable, and a lot more maintainable. \n\nI've had a chat with @DaanHoogland about this approach, and he told me that ACS is trying to move away from the whole non-OSS approach. We're looking into the Juniper approach, we would set up a custom maven repository which would host the required dependencies for the Nuage VSP plugin.\n\nAny remarks or suggestions are always welcome :)\n","created_at":"2016-04-14T08:46:19Z","updated_at":"2016-05-26T03:06:02Z","closed_at":"2016-05-26T03:06:02Z","merged_at":"2016-05-26T03:06:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"2ca0d9b0e105e9b6d5462319e0ada716d3b66e55","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1494/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1494/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1494/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/2ca0d9b0e105e9b6d5462319e0ada716d3b66e55","head":{"label":"nlivens:master_nuage","ref":"master_nuage","sha":"2ca0d9b0e105e9b6d5462319e0ada716d3b66e55","user":{"login":"nlivens","id":3336539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens","html_url":"https://github.com/nlivens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":41410234,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTQxMDIzNA==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"nlivens/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nlivens","id":3336539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens","html_url":"https://github.com/nlivens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nlivens/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

request #988, completed and reinvented.\n\nThis is an initial submission, a request for commentary.\n\nThis started with attempting to make the VirtualMachineName class non-static, and turned into a complete overhaul of how resources in CloudStack are named. Each supported resource has a naming policy that can be overridden to change the way UUIDs and names are generated for them. The primary use case for this is so CloudStack can emulate the naming schemes of other clouds. The default naming policies are in cloud-plugin-naming-policies, cloud-server has the server-naming module which contains the registry lifecycle, and the registered policies are injected into the core managers context.\n\nThe supported resources are:\n- User virtual machines\n- All kinds of system VMs\n- Security groups\n- Volumes\n- Snapshots\n\nThere is one issue we have before we consider this ready for submission. The server-naming module has an ordering dependency. It must be loaded first in cloud-server in order for everything to work. Currently in this PR is a class called `ModuleLoadingComparator` which adds a comparator that forces the server-naming module to the top of the list when loading modules. We obviously want to get rid of this and are looking for suggestions on how to do this.\n","created_at":"2016-04-13T17:05:50Z","updated_at":"2017-07-31T10:22:45Z","closed_at":"2017-07-23T12:27:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b6b937152826abf8ac4da89c1021182a9a897a97","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1492/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1492/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1492/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/c4a1de020a82cbde265181ae059a1c799de26ed3","head":{"label":"greenqloud:pr-naming-policies","ref":"pr-naming-policies","sha":"c4a1de020a82cbde265181ae059a1c799de26ed3","user":{"login":"greenqloud","id":228758,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIyODc1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud","html_url":"https://github.com/greenqloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"b607a3900d7931f58301de0da7ba9b56d3b26b7b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache

This is a bug fix, which is why we target the 4.7 branch.\n\nOriginal pull request:\nFixes regarding usage event emission.\n\nUsageEventUtils was previously not checking deleted accounts, which meant that if an account was deleted that had some resources running on it, those resources would get destroyed without emitting any events.\n\nFurthermore, the VOLUME_DELETE event of ROOT volumes is the responsibility of the UserVmManager, which gets circumvented when expunging resources following the account deletion. Added a check to the AccountManager which catches the ROOT volumes that need to be deleted and emits events for them.\n\nTo test this: Create a new user. As that user, create and destroy an instance. This should cause the VM_CREATE, VM_START, VM_STOP, VM_DESTROY, VOLUME_CREATE, and VOLUME_DELETE events to be emitted. \nCreate a new instance as the same user. Log in as admin, and delete the user. The same set of events should be emitted, and there should be no duplicate DELETE events for the ROOT volume of the previous instance.\n","created_at":"2016-04-13T13:13:21Z","updated_at":"2016-08-02T14:35:11Z","closed_at":"2016-08-02T14:35:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"144c628079a0d7bdd0f2e545cf0de3e4cbc863b6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1491/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1491/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1491/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/6eb5c491621925fb0aecdfc93d79969ab48ff913","head":{"label":"greenqloud:pr-volume-usage-events-fixes-4.7","ref":"pr-volume-usage-events-fixes-4.7","sha":"6eb5c491621925fb0aecdfc93d79969ab48ff913","user":{"login":"greenqloud","id":228758,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIyODc1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud","html_url":"https://github.com/greenqloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:4.7","ref":"4.7","sha":"adaf410109a67c861bb32753c9b13ddd09403672","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache

the\n  current set of four (4) roles\n- All roles will resolve to one of the four known roles types (Admin, Resource\n  Admin, Domain Admin and User) which maintains this association by requiring\n  all new defined roles to specify a role type.\n- Allows changes to roles and API permissions per role at runtime including additions or\n  removal of roles and/or modifications of permissions, without the need\n  of restarting management server(s)\n\nUpgrade/installation notes:\n- The feature will be enabled by default for new installations, existing\n  deployments will continue to use the older static role based api access checker\n  with an option to enable this feature\n- During fresh installation or upgrade, the upgrade paths will add four default\n  roles based on the four default role types\n- For ease of migration, at the time of upgrade commands.properties will be used\n  to add existing set of permissions to the default roles. cloud.account\n  will have a new role_id column which will be populated based on default roles\n  as well\n\nDynamic-roles migration tool: scripts/util/migrate-dynamicroles.py\n- Allows admins to migrate to the dynamic role based checker at a future date\n- Performs a harder one-way migrate and update\n- Migrates rules from existing commands.properties file into db and deprecates it\n- Enables an internal hidden switch to enable dynamic role based checker feature\n","created_at":"2016-04-12T17:10:41Z","updated_at":"2016-05-19T17:35:37Z","closed_at":"2016-05-11T06:04:39Z","merged_at":"2016-05-11T06:04:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"003b97bcffe640e38d089c98e8215de4c8a805e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1489/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1489/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1489/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/003b97bcffe640e38d089c98e8215de4c8a805e6","head":{"label":"shapeblue:dynamicroles-master","ref":"dynamicroles-master","sha":"003b97bcffe640e38d089c98e8215de4c8a805e6","user":{"login":"shapeblue","id":6001764,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYwMDE3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6001764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue","html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35481491,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTQ4MTQ5MQ==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"shapeblue/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shapeblue","id":6001764,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYwMDE3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6001764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue","html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue/cloudstack","description":"The

setting `router.redundant.vrrp.interval` is not used any more and it is now set to a hardcoded 1. \n\nThis results in a failover from master->backup when the backup doesn't hear from the master in ~3.6sec. This is a bit too tight, as we've seen failovers during live migrations. We could reproduce it in about half of the cases. Setting this to setting to 2 (tested it by hardcoding it in the systemvms) gives twice as much time and we didn't see issues any more. Instead of updating the hardcoded setting from 1 to 2, I reimplemented the global setting by sending it to the router with the cmd_line, as the non-VPC router also does.\n\nBackground:\nWhy is the maximum failover time in the example 3.6 seconds? This comes from the advertisement interval and the skew time. The default advertisement interval is 1 second (configurable in keepalived.conf). The skew time helps to keep everyone from trying to transition at once. It is a number between 0 and 1, based on the formula (256 - priority) / 256\n\nAs defined in the RFC, the backup must receive an advertisement from the master every (3 \\* advert_int) + skew_time seconds. If it doesn't hear anything from the master, it takes over. With a backup router priority of 100 (as in the example), the failover will happen at most 3.6 seconds after the master goes down.\n\nSource:

10th field of `createUserAccount` is `networkDomain` (See `AccountService.java`) and it is set to a var named `admin`, which is the user name.\nSo, the first user that is created in a domain that links to LDAP, creates the account within the domain, and sets the `networkDomain` field to the username. All next users are created in the same account.\n\nThen we have the situation that in domain SBP we have a user `rbergsma` that logs in first, gets an account created and then (unless you override) all VMs started in the SBP domain will have network domain `rbergsma`. That is highly confusing and not what is should be.\n\nThe `linkDomainToLdap` api call has no `networkDomain` field, so I propose to make this field empty (set it to null). It's a sting and null / empty is allowed.\n\nOne can also specify the networkDomain when creating a VPC and also there it is allowed to be null.\n\nWhen te networkDomain is needed (and is not set in the domain and not in the VPC) it is constructed by using `guest.domain.suffix` so there always is a networkDomain to be used.\n\nIt makes more sense to manually set it on a domain level, or specify it on the VPC and in the final case end up with something that is clearly generated (like cs342cloud.local) rather than the username of someone else.\n","created_at":"2016-04-10T17:53:08Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T14:22:54Z","closed_at":"2016-05-04T14:22:54Z","merged_at":"2016-05-04T14:22:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"9e1859ee2bbe82ad742c30cd9ca9aa7393d34f36","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1485/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1485/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1485/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/9e1859ee2bbe82ad742c30cd9ca9aa7393d34f36","head":{"label":"remibergsma:fix-ldap-default-domain","ref":"fix-ldap-default-domain","sha":"9e1859ee2bbe82ad742c30cd9ca9aa7393d34f36","user":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33662311,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzY2MjMxMQ==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"remibergsma/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

initialising a VPC router we need to know which IP/device corresponds to a private gateway. This is to solve a problem when stop/starting a VPC router (which gets the private gateway config as a guest network and as a result breaks the functionality). You read it right, the private gateway is sent as type=guest after reboot and type=public initially. \n\nBefore this change, you could add a private gw to a running router but you couldn't restart it (it would mix up the tiers). Now the private gateway is detected properly and it works just fine.\n\nBooting without private gateway:\n\n```\nroot@r-167-VM:~# cat /etc/cloudstack/cmdline.json \n{\n    \"config\": {\n

for interfaces is tricky. They might never appear.. for example when we have entries in `/etc/cloudstack/ips.json` that haven't been plugged yet. Waiting this long makes everything horribly slow (every vm, interface, static route, etc, etc, will hit this wait, for every device). We've seen CloudStack send an `ip_assoc.json` command for `eth1` public nic only and then the router goes crazy waiting for all other interfaces that were there before reboot and aren't there. If only the router would return to the mgt server a success of `eth1`, it would get the command for `eth2` etc etc. Obviously, a destroy works much faster because no state services, so no knowledge of previous devices so no waits :-)\n\nAfter a stop/start the router has state in `/etc/cloudstack/ips.json` and every commands waits. Eventually hitting the hardcoded 120 sec timeout.\n","created_at":"2016-04-07T19:07:50Z","updated_at":"2016-05-26T19:50:34Z","closed_at":"2016-05-26T19:50:34Z","merged_at":"2016-05-26T19:50:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"3636ad1114a89101ed0a14520572b5f0203d454b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1471/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1471/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1471/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/3636ad1114a89101ed0a14520572b5f0203d454b","head":{"label":"remibergsma:47_lower_interface_wait","ref":"47_lower_interface_wait","sha":"3636ad1114a89101ed0a14520572b5f0203d454b","user":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33662311,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzY2MjMxMQ==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"remibergsma/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

for interfaces is tricky. They might never appear.. for example when we have entries in `/etc/cloudstack/ips.json` that haven't been plugged yet. Waiting this long makes everything horribly slow (every vm, interface, static route, etc, etc, will hit this wait, for every device). We've seen CloudStack send an `ip_assoc.json` command for `eth1` public nic only and then the router goes crazy waiting for all other interfaces that were there before reboot and aren't there. If only the router would return to the mgt server a success of `eth1`, it would get the command for `eth2` etc etc. Obviously, a destroy works much faster because no state services, so no knowledge of previous devices so no waits :-)\n\nAfter a stop/start the router has state in `/etc/cloudstack/ips.json` and every commands waits. Eventually hitting the hardcoded 120 sec timeout.\n","created_at":"2016-04-07T18:56:08Z","updated_at":"2016-04-07T19:07:31Z","closed_at":"2016-04-07T19:07:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ac45a823057c355c35ee7c333802e5fbb395a848","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1467/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1467/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1467/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/3636ad1114a89101ed0a14520572b5f0203d454b","head":{"label":"remibergsma:47_lower_interface_wait","ref":"47_lower_interface_wait","sha":"3636ad1114a89101ed0a14520572b5f0203d454b","user":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33662311,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzY2MjMxMQ==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"remibergsma/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

the work started by @likitha, I did not cherry-picked the \ncommit (b9181c689e0e7b5f1e28c81d73710196dfabd0ba) from PR https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/561 due to the fact that the path of that SshHelper class was different of the current SshHelper; that is because the fact that by cherry-picking it would seem that I had changed all the class as the code is from another file.\n\nI made some changes from the cherry-picked commit adding @wilderrodrigues suggestions (create simple methods to have reusable code, make unit tests and create the `WAITING_OPEN_SSH_SESSION` variable to manipulate with the delay of 1000 milliseconds).\n\nAlso, I tried to simplify the logic by assuming that ....\n\n```\nif ((conditions & ChannelCondition.EXIT_STATUS) != 0) {\n        if ((conditions & (ChannelCondition.STDOUT_DATA | ChannelCondition.STDERR_DATA)) == 0) {\n            break;\n        }\n}\n```\n\n... is the same as `((conditions & ChannelCondition.EXIT_STATUS) != 0) && ((conditions & (ChannelCondition.STDOUT_DATA | ChannelCondition.STDERR_DATA)) == 0)`. This expression has the following results according to each possible condition.\n\n| Condition | Value | result |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| TIMEOUT | 0000001 | false |\n| CLOSED | 0000010 | false |\n| STDERR_DATA | 0000100 | false |\n| STDERR_DATA | 0001000 | false |\n| EOF | 0010000 | false |\n| EXIT_STATUS | 0100000 | **true** |\n| EXIT_SIGNAL | 1000000 | false |\n\nAfter testing all the possibilities we can note that the condition of `(conditions & ChannelCondition.EXIT_STATUS) != 0` is sufficient; thus, the simplified \"if\" conditional can be:\n\n`if ((conditions & ChannelCondition.EXIT_STATUS) != 0) {\n    break;\n}`\n\nThis proposed work can be explained by quoting @likitha:\n\n> CheckS2SVpnConnectionsCommand execution involves executing a script (checkbatchs2svpn.sh) in the virtual router. Once CS has opened a session to a virtual router and executed a script in the router, it waits indefinitely till the session either times out or the exit status of the remote process is available. But it is possible that an EOF is reached by the process in the router and the router never set the exit status.\n> \n> References -\n> 1. Some servers never send the exit status, or occasionally \"forget\" to do so (http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org.jvnet.hudson/trilead-ssh2/build212-hudson-1/com/trilead/ssh2/ChannelCondition.java).\n> 2.

TICKET: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-9333 \n## Introduction\n\nIn some environments there is a need to exclude certain VMware clusters from performing OVF operations. This operations are part of: \n- create template\n- create volume snaphsot\n- copy template, volume, images from primary storage to secondary storage\n- migrate volume \n- participate when a template gets cached over to primary storage.\n\nIn ESX/ESXi, OVF operations are low priority and bound to a single CPU and most likely get throttled to certain IOPS and network limits. \nIf the hypervisor chosen for OVF operations is weak or overloaded this results in significantly longer execution of such OVF command and therefore degraded performance of underlying CloudStack API call.\n### Proposed solution\n\nIt is proposed to add a way to exclude hosts from selected clusters for OVF operations.\nTo exclude a cluster, would be necessary to insert a record in <code>cluster_details</code> specifying property **vmware.exclude_from_ovf** in this way: (supposing we want to exclude cluster X)\n\n| cluster_id | name | value |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| X | vmware.exclude_from_ovf | true

To check if I wasn't missing anything I searched for any file that could reference some of those classes. As I haven't found any way of these classes being used, they were removed. Note that some of them I found other references, but references such as commented lines or tests, nothing that could indicate their use (as XML files configuring beans or another class instantiating an object with \"new\").\n\nWaiting for tests.

timeout is worked out as 3 seconds per command or 120 seconds (whichever is larger), but because it's not passed to the first invocation, the default (120 seconds, DEFAULT_EXECUTEINVR_TIMEOUT) is used.\n> \n> In a recent upgrade of our Virtual Routers, the timeout was being hit and increasing `router.aggregation.command.each.timeout` had no effect.

pull request fixes a concurrency issue when disabling static NAT on a bunch of IPs simultaneously. Under the old behavior, executing multiple disable requests would result in invalid IP associations being sent to the virtual router. This commit changes the behavior to apply an IP association for only the IP being added/released, which means that it is impossible for the virtual router to receive invalid data.\n\nThis was tested against a virtual router running on KVM and VMware. It would be nice to have some input how this change could affect redundant routers and other static NAT providers.\n","created_at":"2016-03-21T16:56:42Z","updated_at":"2017-01-17T09:59:26Z","closed_at":"2016-08-02T14:29:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"67b6b0f8fa60fd3a33d607d85d3598b91fe0afa4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1450/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1450/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1450/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/477adfc101ce23f6a590b9d2d690fc8798b67fb6","head":{"label":"greenqloud:pr-static-nat-concurrency-fix","ref":"pr-static-nat-concurrency-fix","sha":"477adfc101ce23f6a590b9d2d690fc8798b67fb6","user":{"login":"greenqloud","id":228758,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIyODc1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud","html_url":"https://github.com/greenqloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:4.7","ref":"4.7","sha":"adaf410109a67c861bb32753c9b13ddd09403672","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache

ticket this PR fixes was opened because KVM-specific code had been added to the StorageSystemSnapshotStrategy class and that class' canHandle method was only prepared to handle managed storage being used with XenServer (and a case was hit for KVM that triggered a CloudRuntimeException to be thrown).\n\nTo solve the problem, I moved the KVM logic to the default snapshot strategy class, which is (unfortunately) named XenserverSnapshotStrategy.\n\nI plan to rename XenserverSnapshotStrategy to something like DefaultSnapshotStrategy in 4.9.\n\nMy guess is that when XenserverSnapshotStrategy was originally written, it was written only for XenServer, but has since that time had its usage increased to support other hypervisors (with non-managed storage).\n","created_at":"2016-03-16T04:57:48Z","updated_at":"2016-04-11T19:07:23Z","closed_at":"2016-04-11T12:41:14Z","merged_at":"2016-04-11T12:41:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"158d196c056b53002b417c195bd96fcc343c382d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1441/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1441/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1441/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/158d196c056b53002b417c195bd96fcc343c382d","head":{"label":"mike-tutkowski:4.7","ref":"4.7","sha":"158d196c056b53002b417c195bd96fcc343c382d","user":{"login":"mike-tutkowski","id":3019295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTkyOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3019295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski","html_url":"https://github.com/mike-tutkowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":15264574,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI2NDU3NA==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"mike-tutkowski/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mike-tutkowski","id":3019295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTkyOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3019295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski","html_url":"https://github.com/mike-tutkowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mike-tutkowski/cloudstack","description":"Mirror
