Description\r\n\r\nEnabled UI button for Dynamic scaling of VM which are on KVM. API support is already here https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/4878\r\n\r\nThere are few constraints with KVM support for dynamic scaling like it has to be custom compute offering and need to set maxmemory, but showing it in UI adds value. It fails with an appropriate error when fixed compute offering is used, so it is worth adding to UI. We can also disable the button in such cases but it may confuse users why it is disabled.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For

PR fixes an error where invalid XML definition is generated when running a virtual machine in UEFI mode on KVM.\r\n\r\nWhen running a virtual machine in UEFI mode, the XML definitions are handled by LibvirtVMDef as follows, depending on the boot mode.\r\n\r\n`````\r\nif (_loader != null) {\r\n    if (_bootmode == BootMode.LEGACY) {\r\n        guestDef.append(\"<loader readonly='yes' secure='no'

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR provides the option to add kvm hosts with empty or wrong password.\r\nTo support this, the cloudstack ssh public key needs to be added in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on host.\r\n\r\nThanks @rhtyd for the idea !\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n1. get cloudstack public key from management server

Description\r\n\r\nUsing the VMWare hypervisor, and with Veeam integration enabled, a full restore of a VM using a backup in Veeam occurs correctly, but in ACS an exception is thrown: `Restore VM Backup (607c2bbf-2c23-49a1-9549-cd402441dcb5) Error during vm backup restore and import: Invalid string format`\r\n\r\nUpon adding more logs to the restore process, it was discovered that this was because the VM being restored had no value in the `hostid` attribute.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this behavior, increments the logs in the restore process for VMs using backups and adds new unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt was tested in a local laboratory:\r\n1.

I have assigned two VMs to a Backup Offering;\r\n2. Using cloudmonkey, I listed the VMs that use this Backup Offering;\r\n3. The two VMs were correctly listed;\r\n4. I removed one of the VMs from the Backup Offering and repeated step 2.\r\n5. Only one VM was listed;\r\n6. Finally I removed the other VM and repeated step 2;\r\n7.

Description\r\n\r\nThe global parameter `remote.access.vpn.psk.length` sets the length of the IPSec key (a PSK). The `ipsec_psk` field (which is a _varchar(256)_ in the `remote_access_vpn` table) stores the PSK in encrypted form - it has an `@Encrypt` annotation. When the value defined in `remote.access.vpn.psk.length` generates a PSK that, when encrypted, has more than 256 characters, ACS throws a database exception when trying to persist the data, preventing the creation of the VPN. \r\n\r\nThis PR changes the `ipsec_psk` field from _varchar(256)_ to _text_ in order to allow the creation of large PSKs.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIn a local lab, I performed the following steps:\r\n- I changed the `ipsec_psk` field from `varchar(256)` to the type `text`;\r\n- I set `remote.access.vpn.psk.length` to 224 (which generates an encrypted PSK with 320 characters - more than the previous limit, 256);\r\n- I restarted ACS Management Server to apply the configuration;\r\n- And then I tried to create a new VPN;\r\n- The VPN has been successfully created.","created_at":"2021-11-05T18:36:20Z","updated_at":"2021-11-23T11:20:12Z","closed_at":"2021-11-23T11:20:12Z","merged_at":"2021-11-23T11:20:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"e2c85decb61ec62194790b08652ecdb006b2ee3e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/21","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/21","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/21/labels","id":6943953,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNjk0Mzk1Mw==","number":21,"title":"4.17.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":383,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-14T02:05:05Z","updated_at":"2022-06-06T14:02:44Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2022-06-06T14:02:44Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5668/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5668/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/5668/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/c62332db20418005b6994d49fd75aafb22b5af27","head":{"label":"scclouds:allow-large-psk","ref":"allow-large-psk","sha":"c62332db20418005b6994d49fd75aafb22b5af27","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds/cloudstack","description":"Apache

diskful set to true, linstor will fail if it cannot create local\r\nstorage for the resource. Which in turn will make it impossible to have a\r\nsetup with just compute nodes on cloudstack.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis is a small bugfix that will enable to have cloudstack-agents without storage to work with Linstor volume plugin.\r\nBefore the plugin always tried to create a diskful assignment on nodes on connect, but if the node doesn't have\r\nlinstor storage, this would fail.\r\nThis was intentionally done to improve performance, as having a local disk makes write operations faster,\r\nbut there are other ways to configure diskful nodes within linstor(auto diskful, manual toggle disk).\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In

Description\r\n\r\nIn VMWare, there are different types of SCSI controllers, such as BusLogic Parallel, LSI Logic Parallel, LSI Logic SAS, etc. All of these sub-types support the disk resize operation, the only exception is the IDE controller. However, in ACS, there is a logical restriction to allow only resizing of volumes of the specific `SCSI` type; thus, not allowing resizing of the SCSI sub-types. This PR corrects this behavior blocking the resize of volumes which uses `IDE` controller only.\r\nMore information can be found at:\r\n- https://www.starwindsoftware.com/blog/storage-controllers-in-vmware-vsphere\r\n- https://www.nakivo.com/blog/scsi-controller-and-other-vmware-controller-types/\r\n- https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vm_admin.doc/GUID-5872D173-A076-42FE-8D0B-9DB0EB0E7362.html\r\n- https://communities.vmware.com/t5/ESXi-Discussions/Unable-to-increase-disk-Space/td-p/397823\r\n\r\n# Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nI tested it in a local lab:\r\n1.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the behavior of the stats collector with respect to VMs that are not running. The need for this is that if a running VM has a state change for some reason, ACS keeps showing the latest metrics stats collected.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nUsing ACS UI, I performed the following steps:\r\n- I deployed a VM and waited for the complete boot;\r\n- I enabled the presentation of metric statistics in the UI;\r\n- I waited for ACS to collect and show metrics stats;\r\n- And then, I tested two different cases:\r\n\t- Case 1 - I stopped VM using ACS UI;\r\n\t- Case 2 - I simulated a VM crash by manually stopping it (directly from the hypervisor);\r\n- In both cases, the metrics stats for the VM were successfully cleared. As expected, when I tested Case 1, cleanup was done immediately. In Case 2, I had to wait for ACS to identify that the VM was stopped and the stats collector try to collect new metric stats.","created_at":"2021-10-27T11:47:02Z","updated_at":"2021-12-06T14:06:11Z","closed_at":"2021-12-06T14:06:11Z","merged_at":"2021-12-06T14:06:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"28385be60998852f1419c5a77d3e0bba6e069807","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/21","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/21","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/21/labels","id":6943953,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNjk0Mzk1Mw==","number":21,"title":"4.17.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":383,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-14T02:05:05Z","updated_at":"2022-06-06T14:02:44Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2022-06-06T14:02:44Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5633/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5633/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/5633/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/608fc6b5deeadd6d399534576a01ecacbf9ca2e1","head":{"label":"scclouds:fix-metrics-stats-for-vms-not-running","ref":"fix-metrics-stats-for-vms-not-running","sha":"608fc6b5deeadd6d399534576a01ecacbf9ca2e1","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds/cloudstack","description":"Apache

Description\r\nAs I pointed on thread [[VOTE] Apache Cloudstack 4.16.0.0 RC1](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rc061a4da7bd50b49ff99b41f059cb4088b998929033755e4b87f631d%40%3Cdev.cloudstack.apache.org%3E), regarding the auto upgrading `systemvms-templates`; the code will  `autoupgrade` the `systemvm-templates` if the templates are found locally. To generate the template during the build, one has to activate the `noredist profile` when building the packages, which is necessary (normally used to) only to VMWare.\r\n\r\nSome people, might not want the noredist JARs from VMware, and therefore will not build with this profile. Furthermore, package `cloudstack-management` goes from **~100Mb** to more than **1.5Gb** when using the `noredist` while executing the 4.16.0.0 build. It happens due to `cloudstack/engine/schema/pom.xml` automatically downloading XenServer, KVM, and VMware `systemvms-templates`. Every time that we build the packages, it will download all these systemvms-templates, and we are unable to decide which one is necessary.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to create specific profiles for each systemvm-template. Therefore, one can build ACS only for the hypervisor it needs, and if it needs to use the auto update of the system VM templates; one can decide not to use this feature and keep manually registering the templates only when they are needed.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring

built the packages with all the profiles:\r\n- `-DdownloadKvmSystemVmTemplate`\r\n- `-DdownloadHypervSystemVmTemplate`\r\n- `-DdownloadVmwareSystemVmTemplate`\r\n- `-DdownloadXenserverSystemVmTemplate`\r\n- `-DdownloadOvmSystemVmTemplate`\r\n\r\nAnd then I built them

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue observed during upgrades, wherein, when a SystemVM template is already registered prior upgrade, the auto-upgrade path still gets invoked - which it shouldn't. The reason for this behavior is the incorrect name of the systemVM template placed in the metadata.ini file, which is used as an input during the upgrade process to identify the template names, checksums, download path, etc. In case of noredist builds, this would cause unnecessary re-registration; in case of non noredist builds, this could lead to the upgrade failing, as it fails to identify the registered template and invokes the auto-upgrade logic - which would fail(expected) due to the absence of the template files.\r\n\r\nFor ex, a snippet of the metadata.ini file (for KVM SystemVM template details)\r\n```\r\n...\r\n[kvm]\r\ntemplatename = systemvm-kvm-4.16 <--- incorrect template name (should be systemvm-kvm-4.16.0)\r\nchecksum = 2f3747a597396d4ee6a2605648808d1a\r\ndownloadurl

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR implements statistics for `ManagementServer`s. The code queries the local `mxBeans` and the filesystem `/proc` for information on the system. if then publishes this to all `ManagementSever`s that keep a list of the recent state of each other. Static data is stored in the database, so if this `ManagementServer` is down others can still query it's last boot/start/stop/shutdown data (and possibly more)\r\n\r\nthe `listManagementServerMetrics` API gathers the data from the internal list and augments it with any static data from the DB.\r\n\r\nDoc PR: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/256\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR checks the pool used space from the bytes used in the storage pool stats collector, for  non-default primary storage pools that cannot provide stats. It also update the used bytes from the pool stats answer for non-default primary storage pools if the pool can provide stats.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PR #4360 updates the used bytes in the database for default primary storage pools only through the stats collector, and computes storage pool space usage from that database value instead of in-memory stats (from the stats collector). So, the storage pool space for non-default primary storage pools is computed against the used bytes in the database which is not updated from the stats collector, and computing with in-memory stats is also removed. This PR keeps the pool used space computation as before (using the in-memory stats from the stats collector), for the non-default primary storage pools.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL -

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR prevents a corner case for the storage cleanup task observed in Vmware in which:\r\n- There are storage pool migrations for the ROOT disk of a VM\r\n- After the migrations, the volumes table creates new volume records, marking the ones to be deleted with state = 'Destroy'\r\n- The storage cleanup task will attempt to expunge the volumes in 'Destroy' state, but if there are underlying storage issues then this task is not completed\r\n- Once the storage issues are solved and the current volume is on the same storage pool as one of the volumes to be removed then the VM can be completely removed \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a way for KVM agent CommandWrappers to register code to run in case of an Agent disconnect event.  When KVM agents lose communication to the management cluster, outstanding work sent to the agent is considered failed, however the work may continue on and run to completion. This is not a big issue for things like live migration where a VM will eventually move to another host and then CloudStack will sync up with the new state, but it becomes more important for long running tasks like volume copy, where we may want to attempt to stop a copy or do some cleanup.\r\n\r\nThis change doesn't introduce much in the way of behavioral changes, it just adds the framework for CommandWrappers to utilize.  It does add simple \"example\" that provides cancellation of VM live migration upon agent disconnect.\r\n\r\nThe functionality is simple, we provide LibvirtComputingResource with a list to store DisconnectHooks, and then it implements the `disconnected()` method to call these hooks in the event of a loss of connectivity. These DisconnectHooks are basically just Java Thread types with a little extra metadata, which are executed in parallel with a best-effort timeout. \r\n\r\nThe CommandWrappers are responsible for providing the implementation for their own DisconnectHooks (one or many), registering them prior to doing their work, and un-registering them when work is complete. The implementer of a DisconnectHook is responsible for dealing with any race conditions - in the live migration example it is understood that it's possible for the hook to be called immediately after live migration has succeeded but before the CommandWrapper can de-register the hook. Therefore cancellation of live migration is treated as best-effort and any errors are logged and ignored.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives Considered\r\nThere are probably better designs for this - perhaps the agent could queue results and the management server could hold onto commands and wait for reconnect to get the results. However, that would be a larger effort, and we would still need to handle agent service stop. This DisconnectHook implementation also works for stopping of the KVM agent service and gives CommandWrappers a way to respond to that.\r\n\r\nThe DisconnectHooks themselves could be Runnables instead of Threads. I chose Threads simply because it's more straightforward to run them in parallel, however I'm open to suggestions and any changes requested as well.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an

details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\nManually tested using the following steps:\r\n- Added PowerFlex storage pool PFlex01 (with storage tag 'pflex'), from storage cluster1\r\n- Added another PowerFlex storage pool PFlex02 (with storage tag 'pflex'), from storage cluster2\r\n- Create a Disk Offering 'PFlexDisk' using storage tag 'pflex'\r\n- Create a Volume 'PFlexVolume01' using 'PFlexDisk' Disk Offering, and attach to any running VM.\r\n- Stop the VM, and migrate the volume 'PFlexVolume01' to another PowerFlex storage pool (which uses 'qemu-img convert' for disk copy).\r\n- Fail the disk copy operation, by killing the 'qemu-img convert' process during copy. This should fail the volume migration, and delete the disk created in destination PowerFlex storage pool.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes issue #5484 \r\n\r\nIn VMware datastore cluster, if DRS triggers a volume migration and if the volume path has changed then the subsequent resize volume operation in CloudStack fails because the update volume path is not there with CloudStack. Observed a similar issue with migrateVolume also if the volume path has been changed. \r\n\r\nHere it is fixed by identifying any change in volumePath or datastore is changed inside the datastore cluster of a volume and update CloudStack database during resize and migrate volume operations\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n1.
