Proposed changes\r\n\r\nAdded runtime non-equi join.\r\nThis change added the runtime non-equi join feature to allow user running non-equi join sqls.\r\nFor example, query like below \r\n```\r\n    select\r\n      |\r\n    non-equi join\r\n     /        \\\r\n   subquery1  subquery2\r\n```\r\ncan now be executed like below\r\n```\r\n    select\r\n      |\r\n    runtime non-equi join\r\n     /        \\\r\n   cube1     cube2\r\n```\r\nKylin can read data from the subquery cubes and do non-equi join during runtime\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If this change need a document change, I will prepare another pr against the `document` branch\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n### Problems:\r\nWhen run docker image for the first time, sometimes hive command will be executed concurrently and it will insert two version records into the VERSION table, this will lead to start kylin unsuccessfully.\r\n\r\n**error messages:** \r\nSomething wrong with Hive CLI or Beeline, please execute Hive CLI or Beeline CLI in terminal to find the root cause.\r\n\r\n### Solutions:\r\ncall script $KYLIN_HOME/bin/check-hive-usability.sh before all kylin.sh, it will insert one version record into VERSION table .\r\n\r\n### Tested on my laptop:\r\n1. cd kylin/docker\r\n2. ./build_image.sh\r\n3. docker run -d -m 8G -p 7070:7070 -p 8088:8088 -p 50070:50070 -p 8032:8032 -p 8042:8042 -p 16010:16010 -p 8998:8998 -p 2181:2181

Proposed changes\r\nAdd condition to treet null input for EncryptUtil methods.  For default settings, password may not be set, so `null` will passed to `PasswordPlaceholderConfigurer#resolvePlaceholder`.  This will cause an \"IllegalArgumentException: Null input buffer\" and lead to startup failure. This fix treets `null` as a legal input and returns `null` for both encrytion and decrytion.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New
