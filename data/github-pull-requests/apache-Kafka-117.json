Avoids writing an 0 checkpoint when StandbyTask.update is called but\r\nwe cannot apply any of the records.\r\n4. Avoids going into a restoring state in the case that the last\r\ncheckpoint is greater or equal to the offset limit (consumer committed\r\noffset). This needs special attention please.

as the current class loader while instantiating and configuring the connector. ( Maybe we should potentially do this for the actual converter invocation as well )\r\n\r\nThe changes were manually tested by including the AvroConverter which used the ServiceLoader mechanism internally in 2 different plugin path. When the connectors were created with AvroConverter only one of them would start successfully before the fix and the other one used to fail with some class mismatch issues in the ServiceLoader. After the fix proposed in the PR, we are able to create the connectors successfully.\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't change any deployment requirements for Converter.

when\r\ncompleting, expiring and failing a batch. However, when batch split\r\nhappens, the original batch (created prior to the split) will never be\r\ncleaned up from inFlightBatches map.

the timeout by a substantial amount, though this will only take effect if the test conditions are not met successfully.\r\n\r\nAdded logic to allow tests to wait for a number of records to have been written to / consumed from a specific topic. This involved extracting the previously-duplicated logic in `ConnectorHandle` and TaskHandle (test framework classes) into a new `RecordLatches` class that can be easily reused by both those handle classes.\r\n\r\nThese integration tests are passing were occasionally failing for me locally, but now I’ve run them successfully nearly a dozen times in a row. If the Jenkins builds are a bit slower, this might help the tests fail less frequently.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [

dug out this problem and found the following.\r\n\r\nThe failing method, `TestUtils#pollRecordsUntilTrue`, was added with commit 1e92b703. However, it calls `Consumer#poll(Duration)` which throws timeout if the given period is expired while fetching both of the metadata and records. (i.e., dislike to deprecated `Consumer#poll(long)` method.) For this reason, it is easy to fail and making the related tests flaky.\r\n\r\nIt seems like there are two approaches to fix this problem:\r\n\r\n1. Increase the timeout duration (current PR)\r\n2. Use a dedicated method to fetch the metadata.\r\n\r\nHow do you think? cc/ @mjsax\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

This\r\nprecludes us from reading files whose size is not known in advance, i.e.\r\nany file opened with flag S_IFIFO.\r\n\r\nThis change updates the method to use stream to read the content of the file.\r\nIt has couple of practical advantages:\r\n\r\n1. Allows bash process substitution to pass in strings as file. So we can\r\nsay `./bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --reassignment-json-file <(echo\r\n\"reassignment json\")\r\n\r\n2. When adding systest for commands that take file, we don't have to\r\ncreate real physical file. Instead we can just dump the content of the\r\nfile on the command line.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

flushing before closing producers\r\n\r\nPrior to this change an NPE is raised when calling AssignedTasks.close\r\nunder the following conditions:\r\n\r\n1. EOS is enabled\r\n2. The task was in a suspended state\r\n\r\nThe cause for the NPE is that when a clean close is requested for a\r\nStreamTask the StreamTask tries to commit. However, in the suspended\r\nstate there is no producer so ultimately an NPE is thrown for the\r\ncontained RecordCollector in flush.\r\n\r\nIt is my opinion that in the long term, this (and probably other\r\nsurprising state interactions) could be cleaned up by consolidating\r\nstate into one place instead of spreading it across AssignedTasks,\r\nStreamTask, and AbstractTask. However, that is a much larger, more risky\r\nchange, and this issue is currently considered minor.\r\n\r\nThe fix put forth in this commit is to have AssignedTasks call\r\ncloseSuspended when it knows the underlying StreamTask is suspended.\r\n\r\nCurrently the only externally visible way to detect this problem in test\r\nseems to be via logging. This is because the NPE is logged but then\r\nsuppressed under the following sequence:\r\n\r\nRecordCollectorImpl.flush:266\r\n    - throws NPE (producer is null)\r\n\r\nStreamTask.suspend:578\r\n    - goes through the finally block and then reraises the NPE\r\n\r\nStreamTask.close:706\r\n    - catches the NPE, calls closeSuspended with the NPE\r\n\r\nStreamTask.closeSuspended:676\r\n    - rethrows the NPE after some cleanup\r\n\r\nAssignedTasks.close:341\r\n    - catches and logs the exception\r\n    - tries a \"dirty\" close (clean = true) which succeeds\r\n    - firstException is NOT set because the test `!closeUnclean(task)`\r\n      does not hold.\r\n\r\nIt seems this is not the intended behavior? If so, I will happily\r\ncorrect that and stop using logging as a way to detect failure.\r\n\r\nOtherwise this commit does not currently pass checkstyle because I'm\r\nusing blacklisted imports: `LogCaptureAppender` and its various\r\ndependencies from `log4j`. I would appreciate guidance as to whether we\r\nshould whitelist these or use another technique for detection.\r\n\r\nNote also that this test is quite involved. I could have just tested\r\nthat AssignedTasks calls closeSuspended when appropriate, but that is\r\ntesting, IMO, a detail of the implementation and doesn't actually verify\r\nwe reproduced the original problem as it was described. I feel much more\r\nconfident that we are reproducing the behavior - and we can test exactly\r\nthe conditions that lead to it - when testing across AssignedTasks and\r\nStreamTask. I believe this is an additional support for the argument of\r\neventually consolidating the state split across classes.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

is a draft implementation of [KAFKA-8789](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-8789). I dug out the problem and found the following.\r\n\r\nBefore 2.1.0 (Confluent Platform 5.1.x, 8a78d764), `ConsoleConsumer.ConsumerWrapper#recordIter` was initialized with `consumer.poll(0)`, which in turn calls `KafkaConsumer#poll(Timer, includeMetadataInTimeout = false)` and fetches metadata regardless of timeout.\r\n\r\nHowever, this code was removed while removing the deprecated `KafkaConsumer#poll(long)`. So, `ConsoleConsumer.ConsumerWrapper#receive` now fetches metadata just before starting consuming, with timeout limitation. If an insufficient timeout is given, it calls the following methods and finally ends with `TimeoutException`.\r\n\r\n`KafkaConsumer#poll(Duration, boolean)`\r\n-> `KafkaConsumer#updateAssignmentMetadataIfNeeded(Timer)`\r\n-> `KafkaConsumer#updateFetchPositions`\r\n-> `ConsumerCoordinator#refreshCommittedOffsetsIfNeeded`\r\n-> `ConsumerCoordinator#fetchCommittedOffsets`\r\n-> `ConsumerNetworkClient#poll(RequestFuture, Timer)`\r\n-> `ConsumerNetworkClient#poll(Timer, PollCondition)`\r\n-> `ConsumerNetworkClient#poll(Timer, PollCondition, boolean)`\r\n-> `ConsumerNetworkClient#failExpiredRequests`\r\n\r\nTo make this tool to work like before 2.1.0, we need to add a method to update `KafkaConsumer`'s metadata before starting polling. I can't be certain what approach would be the best, I added `Consumer#poll(Duration, boolean)` as a temporal workaround. (That is, this PR will be updated following the related KIP discussion.)\r\n\r\ncc/ @hachikuji @viktorsomogyi @ijuma @HeartSaVioR\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

ships with default ZK configuration. With the upgrade to ZK 3.5, our defaults include running ZK's AdminServer on port 8080. This is an unfortunate default as it tends to cause conflicts.\r\n\r\nI suggest we default to disable ZK's AdminServer in the default ZK configs that we ship. Users who want to use AdminServer can enable it and set the port to something that works for them. Realistically, in most production environments, a different ZK server will be used anyway. So this is mostly to save new users who are trying Kafka on their own machine from running into accidental and frustrating port conflicts.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

to @lbradstreet for profiling the producer with a large number of partitions.\r\n\r\nCache `topicMetadata`, `brokers` and `controller` in the `MetadataResponse`\r\nthe first time it's needed avoid unnecessary recomputation. We were previously\r\ncomputing`brokersMap` 4 times per partition in one code path that was invoked from\r\nmultiple places. This is a regression introduced via a42f16f980 and first released\r\nin 2.3.0.\r\n\r\nThe `Cluster` constructor became significantly more allocation heavy due to\r\n2c44e77e2f20, first released in 2.2.0. Replaced `merge` calls with more verbose,\r\nbut more efficient code. Added a test to verify that the returned collections are\r\nunmodifiable.\r\n\r\nAdd `topicAuthorizedOperations` and `clusterAuthorizedOperations` to\r\n`MetadataResponse` and remove `data()`

error\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes a bug in the handling of MESSAGE_TOO_LARGE errors. The large batch is split, the smaller batches are re-added to the accumulator, and the batch is deallocated, but it was not removed from the list of in-flight batches. When the batch was eventually expired from the in-flight batches, the producer would try to deallocate it a second time, causing an error. This patch changes the behavior to correctly remove the batch from the list of in-flight requests.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

KIP-221: Enhance DSL with Connecting Topic Creation and Repartition Hint\r\nTickets: [KAFKA-6037](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-6037) [KAFKA-8611](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-8611)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis is PR for [KIP-221](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-221%3A+Enhance+DSL+with+Connecting+Topic+Creation+and+Repartition+Hint). Goal of this PR is to introduce new `KStream#repartition` operator and underline machinery that can be used for repartition configuration on `KStream` instance. \r\n\r\n## Notable Changes\r\n- Introduced `org.apache.kafka.streams.kstream.internals.graph.UnoptimizableRepartitionNode`. This node is **NOT** subject of optimization algorithm, therefore, each `repartition` operation is excluded from optimization algorithm.\r\n- Introduced `org.apache.kafka.streams.processor.internals.InternalTopicProperties` class that can be used for capturing repartition topic configurations passed via DSL operations\r\n- Added `org.apache.kafka.streams.processor.internals.InternalTopologyBuilder#internalTopicNamesWithProperties` map for storing mapping between internal topics and their corresponding configuration. If configuration is present `RepartitionTopicConfig` is enriched with configurations passed via DSL operations (In this case via `org.apache.kafka.streams.kstream.Repartitioned` class).\r\n- Added `KStreamRepartitionIntegrationTest` for testing different scenarios of `KStream#repartition`\r\n1) Should create repartition topic if key changing operation was NOT performed\r\n2) Should Perform Key Select Operation When Repartition Operation Is Used With Key Selector\r\n3) Should Create Repartition Topic With Specified Number Of Partitions\r\n4) Should Inherit Repartition Topic Partition Number From Upstream Topic When Number Of Partitions Is Not Specified.\r\n5) Should Create Only One Repartition Topic When Repartition Is Followed By GroupByKey.\r\n6) Should Generate Repartition Topic When Name Is Not Specified.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [x] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [x] Verify documentation (including upgrade

](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-476) saw the introduction of a new `Admin` interface to replace the use of the `AdminClient` abstract class.  A key driver for this was to allow the use of dynamic proxies for the admin client supplied to Kafka streams via the `KafkaClientSupplier`.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it would be a binary incompatible change to change `KafkClientSupplier.getAdminClient` to return the `Admin` interface, rather than `AdminClient`. See https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/7157 which reverted the change.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, I've added a new method `getAdmin` and deprecated the old `getAdminClient`.\r\n\r\nThe new `getAdmin` method has a default implementation that simply calls the old `getAdminClient` method.  Both `DefaultKafkaClientSupplier` and `MockClientSupplier` implement the new method.  All KS code has been switched to call the new method.\r\n\r\nThis has the benefit of being binary compatible, but does leave users still needing to implement the, now deprecated, `getAdminClient`

Since mx4j-tools.jar is not packaged into the final released tgz file by default, we can't monitor kafka brokers by web inferface. If we want to do it, we must find a mx4j-tools.jar in the maven repository by our own and put it under the directory $KAFKA_HOME/libs, which is very inconvenient.\r\n2. In Mx4jLoader, we read the property values of 'kafka_mx4jenable' and 'mx4jport' from system properties, but there is no way for us to set the switch and customize the port of mx4j-tools. We could add a configuration item in kafka-run-class.sh. For example, if MX4J_PORT is set, we add -Dkafka_mx4jenable=true -Dmx4jport=$MX4J_PORT into the start command.\r\n\r\ntesting strategy:\r\n1. build the release tar.gz file\r\n2. check if mx4j-tools.jar is under the directory of $kAFKA_HOME/libs \r\n3. start broker, and check if http://$broker_ip:$MX4J_PORT works.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]
