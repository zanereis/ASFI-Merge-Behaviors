What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR removes the double holding of properties.\r\nThe main problem: The InterpreterLauncher class  is a singleton, because of your PluginManager Cache Implementation.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/22ae6cdcd1f526b66808c2b994b53f808f390cfe/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/plugin/PluginManager.java#L104C23-L126\r\n\r\nAs a result, every InterpreterProcess started by an InterpreterLauncher has the same properties, because we have the following lines of code in almost all launchers.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/22ae6cdcd1f526b66808c2b994b53f808f390cfe/zeppelin-plugins/launcher/yarn/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/launcher/YarnInterpreterLauncher.java#L44\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/22ae6cdcd1f526b66808c2b994b53f808f390cfe/zeppelin-plugins/launcher/k8s-standard/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/launcher/K8sStandardInterpreterLauncher.java#L107\r\n\r\nThe problem that arises here is when multiple jobs are started in parallel via CronJobs using one launcher. In the end, the \"last\" process overwrites the properties of the previous ones. This makes problems, if the individual InterpreterProcesses adjust the properties, as for example in the K8sInterpreterProcess.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/22ae6cdcd1f526b66808c2b994b53f808f390cfe/zeppelin-plugins/launcher/k8s-standard/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/launcher/K8sRemoteInterpreterProcess.java#L447-L458\r\n\r\nFor this reason, this PR removes the properties in the launcher object and all launchers are forced to access the properties in the current context.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\nImprovement\r\nRefactoring\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5897\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* CI\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update?

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR changes the RemoteScheduler\r\nThe main change is the executor of the RemoteScheduler. It's now a separate FIFO Executor (one Thread). As a result, jobs are now queued in the Zeppelin server and not in the RemoteInterpreter.\r\nSince previously the jobs were queued in the remote interpreter due to parallelism in the Zeppelin server, the cancellation of jobs did not work, which is why the test failed.\r\n\r\nThe interrupt behaviour has also been improved.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5900\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* CI\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update?

What is this PR for?\r\nRemove outdated maven plugin setting.\r\n\r\nI saw some warnings when I check some maven logs.\r\n```\r\n[WARNING] The POM for org.eclipse.m2e:lifecycle-mapping:jar:1.0.0 is missing, no dependency information available\r\n[WARNING] Failed to retrieve plugin descriptor for org.eclipse.m2e:lifecycle-mapping:1.0.0: Plugin org.eclipse.m2e:lifecycle-mapping:1.0.0 or one of its dependencies could not be resolved: org.eclipse.m2e:lifecycle-mapping:jar:1.0.0 was not found in https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2 during a previous attempt. This failure was cached in the local repository and resolution is not reattempted until the update interval of central has elapsed or updates are forced\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried to find the package in maven central but couldn't find it and reached a description of https://www.eclipse.org/m2e/documentation/m2e-making-maven-plugins-compat.html. This link shows that the setting is only for maven plugin developers. I don't know the initial motivation for the plugin because it's added in 2013 and I didn't contribute to Zeppelin at that time. I, however, feel like we don't need it for now because the description indicates it's only for plugin developers.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Remvoe plugin\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nNothing should change\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation?
