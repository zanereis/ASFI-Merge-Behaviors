support expanding tasks against a dict's *content* at runtime (e.g. when given `{\"a\": [1, 2]}`, expand against 1 and 2), the scheduler must be able to know how long each value is. This means we need to extend the TaskMap metadata store a bit, so it can not only store information on the dict itself, but also on the values, and at the same time.\r\n\r\nA new field \"item\" is thus added. When it's set to an empty string (the default), the row stores information on the upstream's XCom push itself.

trying to make Breeze 2 and pre-commit hooks work on Windows. Changes:\r\n\r\n1. Those in `dev` should be pretty straightfoward fixes for Windows.\r\n2. `python3` shebangs are mass-replaced in pre-commit scripts. Those scripts run in virtual environments, so specifying `3` is unnecessary, and they break on Windows.\r\n3. `pre_commit_check_provider_yaml_files.py` is rewritten to use `pathlib.Path` so we can take advantage of `as_posix` for path normalisation, to make comparison between slashes work as expected.\r\n\r\nThis seems to make Breeze work-ish for me. Some more work is still needed for pre-commit, mostly to tidy up logic dealing with encoding and line endings. Those are a mess right now.","created_at":"2022-06-02T06:44:41Z","updated_at":"2022-06-05T09:30:37Z","closed_at":"2022-06-03T11:32:19Z","merged_at":"2022-06-03T11:32:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"da2e98ad7042acddd2b98dbda543573cd36f1f43","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769003317,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5MDAzMzE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:dev-tools","name":"area:dev-tools","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2451280808,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDUxMjgwODA4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/full%20tests%20needed","name":"full

Permissions\r\n{manager.py:571} INFO - Added Permission menu access on Permissions to role Admin\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because in code block 1, `ActionModelView.class_permission_name = \"Permissions\"`, and the view name used in code block 2 is `\"Permissions\",`. This causes a conflict where permissions get removed from and then added to `Permissions` every time the app worker loads.\r\n\r\nAs a solution, I've renamed the view name in the second code block to `Permission Pairs`, which removes the conflict between the two code blocks.","created_at":"2022-06-01T07:27:56Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T15:19:23Z","closed_at":"2022-06-02T18:04:53Z","merged_at":"2022-06-02T18:04:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"be21e08e1bb6202626c12b2375f24167cf22838a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver

ARM cache builds started to hang recently at yarn prod step.\r\nThe most likely reason are limited resources we had for the ARM\r\ninstance to run the docker build - it was rather small instance\r\nwith 2GB RAM and it is likely not nearly enought to cope with\r\nrecent changes related to Grid View where we likely need much\r\nmore memory during the yarn build step.\r\n\r\nThis change increases the instance memory to 8 GB (c6g.xlarge).\r\nAlso this instance type gives 70% cost saving and has very low\r\nprobability of being evicted (it's not in high demand in Ohio\r\nRegion of AWS.\r\n\r\nAlso the AMI used is refreshed with latest software (docker)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

pushing multi-platform images when building cache on CI\r\nhas some problems recently, connected with ghcr.io being more\r\nvulnerable to race condition described in this issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/5978\r\n\r\nApparently when two, different platform layers are pushed about\r\nthe same time to ghcr.io, the error\r\n\"cannot reuse body, request must be retried\" is generated.\r\n\r\nHowever we actually do not even need to build the multiplatform\r\nlatest images because as of recently we have separate cache for each\r\nplatform, and the ghcr.io/:latest images are not used any more\r\nnot even for docker builds. We we always build images rather than\r\npull and we use --from-cache for that - specific per platform. The only\r\nimage pulling we do is when we pull the :COMMIT_HASH images in CI- but\r\nthose are single-platform images (amd64) and even if we add tests for\r\narm, they will have different tag.\r\n\r\nHopefully we can still build release images without causing the\r\nrace condition too frequently - this is more likely because when\r\nwe build images for cache we use machines with different performance\r\ncharacteristics and the same layers are pushed at different times\r\nfrom different platforms.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

is an issue with pushing cache to docker registry that\r\nis connected to containerd bug but started to appear more\r\nfrequently recently (as evidenced for example by\r\nhttps://github.community/t/buildx-failed-with-error-cannot-reuse-body-request-must-be-retried/253178\r\n). The issue is still open in containerd:\r\nhttps://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/5978.\r\n\r\nUntil it if fixed, we disable fail-fast on pushing cache\r\nso that even if it happens, we just have to re-run that single\r\npython version that actually failed.

--volume flag is an old style of specifying mounts used by docker,\r\nthe newer and more explicit version is --mount where you have to\r\nspecify type, source, destination in the form of key/value pairs.\r\n\r\nThis is more explicit and avoids some guesswork when volumes are\r\nmounted (for example seems that on WSL2 volume name might be\r\nguessed as path wrongly). The change explicitly specifies which\r\nof the mounts are bind mounts and which are volume mounts.\r\n\r\nAnother nice side effect of this change is that when source is\r\nmissing, docker will not automatically create directories with the\r\nmissing name but it will fail. This is nicer because before it\r\nled to creating directories when they were missing (for example\r\n.bash_aliases and similar). This allows us to avoid some cleanups\r\nto account for those files being created - instead we simply\r\nskip those mounts if the file/folder does not exist.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

pre-commits that require CI image run docker command under\r\nthe hood that is highly optimized for performance (only mounts\r\nfiles that are necessary to be mounted) - in order to improve\r\nperformance on Mac OS and make sure that artifacts are not left\r\nin the source code of Airflow.\r\n\r\nHowever that makes the command slightly more difficult to debug\r\nbecause they generate dynamically the docker command used,\r\nincluding the volumens that should be mounted when the docker\r\ncommand is run.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds better diagnostics to the pre-commit scripts\r\nallowing VERBOSE=\"true\" and DRY_RUN=\"true\" variables that can\r\nhelp with diagnosing problems such as running the scripts on\r\nWSL2.\r\n\r\nIt also fixes a few documentation bugs that have been missed\r\nafter changing names of the image-related static checks and\r\nthanks to separating the common code to utility function\r\nit allows to set SKIP_IMAGE_PRE_COMMITS variable to true\r\nwhich will skip running all pre-commit checks that require\r\nbreeze image to be available locally.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
