The test cases in group `slow` are fixed, while the number of test cases in group `others` continues to increase, which has had a certain impact on the testing duration and stability of group `others`. \r\n\r\nSo this PR proposes to add a new testing group to share the testing pressure of `sql others` group, which has made the testing time of the three groups more average, and hope it can improve the stability of the GA task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nShould monitor

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFollow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41191 to clean up the code in UnresolvedTableSpec and related plans:\r\n* Rename `OptionsListExpressions` as `OptionList`\r\n* Rename `trait TableSpec` as `TableSpecBase`\r\n* Rename `ResolvedTableSpec` as `TableSpec`, make sure all the physical plans are using `TableSpec` instead of `TableSpecBase`.\r\n* Move option list expressions to UnresolvedTableSpec, so that all the specs are in one class.\r\n* Make UnaryExpression an `UnaryExpression`, so that transforming with `mapExpressions` will transform it and the option list expressions in its child\r\n* Restore the signatures of class `CreateTable`, `CreateTableAsSelect`, `ReplaceTable` and `ReplaceTableAsSelect`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMake the code implementation simpler\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR add a new SQL config: `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionNum`. User can set it to avoid generating too many partitions when reading file-based sources. Too many partitions will increase the various overheads of the driver and cause Shuffle service OOM.\r\n\r\nThe following is the GC log of the Shuffle service:\r\n```\r\n2023-06-08T01:41:01.871-0700: 7303.965: [Full GC (Allocation Failure) 2023-06-08T01:41:01.871-0700: 7303.965: [CMS: 4194304K->4194304K(4194304K), 7.4010107 secs]2023-06-08T01:41:09.272-0700: 7311.366: [Class Histogram (after full gc):\r\n num     #instances         #bytes  class name\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n   1:       7110660     2334927400  [C\r\n   2:      19465810      467514416  [I\r\n   3:       6754570      270182800  org.apache.spark.network.protocol.ChunkFetchRequest\r\n   4:       6661155      266446200  org.sparkproject.io.netty.channel.DefaultChannelPromise\r\n   5:       6639056      265562240  org.apache.spark.network.buffer.FileSegmentManagedBuffer\r\n   6:       6639055      265562200  org.apache.spark.network.protocol.RequestTraceInfo\r\n   7:       6663764      213240448  org.sparkproject.io.netty.util.Recycler$DefaultHandle\r\n   8:       6659382      213100224  org.sparkproject.io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext$WriteTask\r\n   9:       6659218      213094976  org.apache.spark.network.server.ChunkFetchRequestHandler$$Lambda$156/886274988\r\n  10:       6640444      212494208  java.io.File\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. The PR aims to selectively rescale large RDDs only, while keeping the existing behavior in the same way in small RDDs. So directly increasing `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes` is not acceptable:\r\n   1. There are multiple data sources in one SQL, setting `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes` will affect all data sources.\r\n   2. We don't know how much `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes` should be set to, sometimes it may be very large(More than 20GiB).\r\n\r\n\r\n2. To make it do not generate too many partitions if it is very large partitioned and bucketed table as it is not always use bucket scan since [SPARK-32859](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32859).\r\n   \r\n   Before SPARK-32859 | After SPARK-32859\r\n   --- | ---\r\n   <img width=\"400\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/5399861/5e14932b-aa3d-4b14-b80c-e3ff348958c4\"> | <img width=\"400\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/5399861/170311a0-c086-408a-9d95-17031e21e16a\">\r\n\r\n3. Avoid generating too many partitions if these are lots of small files.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. Unless the user sets

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFollowing the discussion of `foreachBatch` implementation, we decide to implement connect StreamingQueryListener in a way that the server runs the listener code, rather than the client. \r\n\r\nFollowing this POC: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41096, this is going to be done in a way such that \r\n1. Client sends serialized python code to server\r\n2. Server initializes a Scala `StreamingQueryListener`, which initialize the python progress and run the python code. (Details of this step still depends on `foreachBatch` implementation.\r\n3. When a new StreamingQuery Event comes in, the jvm serialize it to JSON and send it to the python progress to process.\r\n\r\nThis PR focus on step 3, the serialization and deserialization of the events.\r\n\r\nAlso finishes a TODO to check exception in QueryTerminatedEvent\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to transfer a local relation from **the Python connect client** to the server in streaming way when it exceeds some size which is defined by the SQL config `spark.sql.session.localRelationCacheThreshold`. The implementation is similar to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40827.  In particular:\r\n1. The client applies the `sha256` function over **the proto form** of the local relation;\r\n2. It checks presents of the relation at the server side by sending the relation hash to the server;\r\n3. If the server doesn't have the local relation, the client transfers the local relation as an artefact with the name `cache/<sha256>`;\r\n4. As soon as the relation has presented at the server already, or transferred recently, the client transform the logical plan by replacing the `LocalRelation` node by `CachedLocalRelation` with the hash.\r\n5. On another hand, the server converts `CachedLocalRelation` back to `LocalRelation` by retrieving the relation body from the local cache.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the issues of creating a large dataframe from a local collection:\r\n```python\r\npyspark.errors.exceptions.connect.SparkConnectGrpcException: <_MultiThreadedRendezvous of RPC that terminated with:\r\n\tstatus = StatusCode.RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED\r\n\tdetails = \"Sent message larger than max (134218508 vs. 134217728)\"\r\n\tdebug_error_string = \"UNKNOWN:Error received from peer localhost:50982

change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test:\r\n```\r\n$ python/run-tests --parallelism=1 --testnames 'pyspark.sql.tests.connect.test_connect_basic

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe see stage was still running after AQE plan finished. This is because the plan which contains a join with one empty side has been converted to LocalTableScanExec during AQEOptimizer, but the other side of this join is still running (shuffle map stage).\r\n\r\nIt's no meaning to keep running that stage, so It's better to cancel the running stage when main query is going to final plan in case wasting the task resource.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nmaybe yes, the unnecessary running stage will be cancelled.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen we store a BINARY value (e.g. BigInt(\"1\").toByteArray) / X'01') either via spark-shell or spark-sql, and then read it from spark-shell, it outputs `[01]`. However, it does not encode correctly when querying it via spark-sql.\r\n```scala\r\nspark-shell: \r\nscala> import org.apache.spark.sql.Row \r\nscala> import org.apache.spark.sql.types._\r\nscala> val rdd = sc.parallelize(Seq(Row(BigInt(\"1\").toByteArray)))\r\nrdd: org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] = ParallelCollectionRDD[356] at parallelize at <console>:28\r\nscala> val schema = new StructType().add(StructField(\"c1\", BinaryType, true))\r\nschema: org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType = StructType(StructField(c1,BinaryType,true))\r\nscala> val df = spark.createDataFrame(rdd, schema)\r\ndf: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [c1: binary]\r\nscala> df.write.saveAsTable(\"binary_vals_shell\")\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select * from binary_vals_shell;\").show(false)\r\n+----+\r\n|c1  |\r\n+----+\r\n|[01]|\r\n+----+\r\n\r\nspark-sql:\r\nspark-sql> select * from binary_vals_shell;\r\n\r\nTime taken: 0.077 seconds, Fetched 1 row(s)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe difference are `show` method in spark-shell will convert binary to hex string, spark-sql will not.\r\n\r\nThis PR bring a new sql config `spark.sql.hive.bytesToHex`, when set it to true, we will convert binary to hex string in spark-sql client.\r\nAfter change:\r\n./bin/spark-sql \r\n```scala\r\n./bin/spark-sql -c spark.sql.hive.bytesToHex=true\r\nspark-sql (default)> select * from binary_vals_shell;\r\n[01]\r\nTime taken: 2.647 seconds, Fetched 1 row(s)\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe expect the two Spark interfaces (spark-sql & spark-shell) to behave consistently for the same data type (BINARY) & input (BigInt(\"1\").toByteArray) / X'01') combination.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the binary result will be changed after set config `spark.sql.hive.bytesToHex=true`\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new test\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

This ports back the commit https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/d3b9f4e7b1be7d89466cf80c3e38890c7add7625 (PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41089) to branch-3.4. This is a clean cherry-pick.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSkip reusing sst file for same version of RocksDB state store to avoid id mismatch error\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn case of task retry on the same executor, its possible that the original task completed the phase of creating the SST files and uploading them to the object store. In this case, we also might have added an entry to the in-memory map for `versionToRocksDBFiles` for the given version. When the retry task creates the local checkpoint, its possible the file name and size is the same, but the metadata ID embedded within the file may be different. So, when we try to load this version on successful commit, the metadata zip file points to the old SST file which results in a RocksDB mismatch id error.\r\n\r\n```\r\nMismatch in unique ID on table file 24220. Expected: {9692563551998415634,4655083329411385714} Actual: {9692563551998415639,10299185534092933087} in file /local_disk0/spark-f58a741d-576f-400c-9b56-53497745ac01/executor-18e08e59-20e8-4a00-bd7e-94ad4599150b/spark-5d980399-3425-4951-894a-808b943054ea/StateStoreId(opId=2147483648,partId=53,name=default)-d89e082e-4e33-4371-8efd-78d927ad3ba3/workingDir-9928750e-f648-4013-a300-ac96cb6ec139/MANIFEST-024212\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change avoids reusing files for the same version on the same host based on the map entries to reduce the chance of running into the error above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test\r\n\r\nRocksDBSuite\r\n```\r\n[info] Run completed in 35 seconds, 995 milliseconds.\r\n[info] Total number of tests run:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`SparkConnectStreamHandler` treats the proto requests from connect client and send the responses back to connect client. `SparkConnectStreamHandler` holds a component `StreamObserver` to send responses. Currently, SparkConnectPlanner also knows `StreamObserver` passed by method parameters. So the behavior introduces some issues.\r\n\r\n- Visibility\r\n\r\n`SparkConnectStreamHandler` holds the `StreamObserver` and shouldn't expose it. Now, we expose `StreamObserver` to `SparkConnectPlanner` and the latter is public, so every developers could use it.\r\n\r\n- Safety\r\n\r\nBased on the visibility issue, this is usually not a secure strategy.\r\n\r\n- Code Design\r\n\r\nBecause `SparkConnectStreamHandler` is fully responsible for responding to RPC, which is a division of responsibilities in good programming. The better code design, the easier to extend function.\r\n\r\nSo I think we should keep the `StreamObserver` could be accessed only with `SparkConnectStreamHandler`.\r\nThis PR wraps the detail of `StreamObserver` into `SparkConnectStreamHandler`, `SparkConnectPlanner` only need call `sendResponse` if the response is ready.\r\n\r\nThis PR want decouple the process handle commands and the other process send responses on server side.\r\n\r\nNote: As we disscussed on https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41379, this PR doesn't delay to send any response \"right now\" and expects that it will be returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDecouple handle command and send response on server side.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nJust update the inner implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExists test cases.\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-09T03:54:14Z","updated_at":"2023-10-15T00:19:18Z","closed_at":"2023-10-15T00:19:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"659f720ea85a2e5306f77f311d5e48da1bdff91b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41527/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41527/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41527/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ae150cb0eaaf18084038bad090e618be4133338f","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-43879_new2","ref":"SPARK-43879_new2","sha":"ae150cb0eaaf18084038bad090e618be4133338f","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

Here is an sample log line:\r\n\r\n23/06/08 23:48:14 INFO KafkaDataConsumer: From Kafka topicPartition=topic-121-2 groupId=spark-kafka-source-623fa0a8-04a5-4f34-a9ad-adbf31494e85-711383366-executor read 1 records, taking 504554479 nanos, during time span of 504620999 nanos\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor each task, Kafka source should report fraction of time spent in KafkaConsumer to fetch records. It should also report overall read bandwidth (bytes or records read / time spent fetching).\r\n\r\nThis will be useful in verifying if fetching is the bottleneck.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a follow-up on #16685 and #16692.\r\n\r\nImplements upsert mode for `SaveMode.Append` of the MySql, MsSql, and Postgres JDBC source.\r\n\r\nSee #41611 for an alternative using the `MERGE INTO` command (not supported by MySql).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe JDBC writer only supports either truncating the existing table or inserting. Duplicates, i.e. rows with identical values in the primary or unique index columns, cause an exception, permitting updating existing and inserting new rows.\r\n\r\nRe-evaluating a partition due to executor loss will insert rows that have been inserted in an earlier attempt, which kills the entier Spark job.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis adds `upsert` and

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen we use spark shell to submit job like this:\r\n```scala\r\n$ spark-shell --conf spark.driver.memory=1g\r\n\r\nval df = spark.range(5000000).withColumn(\"str\", lit(\"abcdabcdabcdabcdabasgasdfsadfasdfasdfasfasfsadfasdfsadfasdf\"))\r\nval df2 = spark.range(10).join(broadcast(df), Seq(\"id\"), \"left_outer\")\r\n\r\ndf2.collect\r\n```\r\nThis will cause the driver to hang indefinitely.\r\nWhen we disable AQE, the `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` will be throws.\r\n\r\nAfter I check the code, the reason are wrong way to use `Throwable::initCause`. It happened when OOM be throw on https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/exchange/BroadcastExchangeExec.scala#L184 . Then https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/errors/QueryExecutionErrors.scala#L2401 will be executed. \r\nIt use `new SparkException(..., case=oe).initCause(oe.getCause)`. \r\nThe doc in `Throwable::initCause` say\r\n```\r\nThis method can be called at most once. It is generally called from within the constructor,\r\nor immediately after creating the throwable. If this throwable was created with Throwable(Throwable)\r\nor Throwable(String, Throwable), this method cannot be called even once.\r\n```\r\nSo when we call it, the `IllegalStateException` will be throw. Finally, the `promise.tryFailure(ex)` never be called. The driver will be blocked.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix `NullOps.(eq|ne)` and `NumOps.(eq|ne)` for pandas API on Spark with Spark Connect.\r\n\r\nThis includes SPARK-43684, SPARK-43685, SPARK-43686, SPARK-43691 at once, because they are all related similar modifications in single file.\r\n\r\nThis PR also introduce new util function `_is_extension_dtypes` to check whether the given object is a type of extension dtype or not, and apply to all related functions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe reason is that pandas API on Spark with Spark Connect operates differently from pandas as below:\r\n\r\n\r\n**For `ne`:**\r\n```python\r\n>>> pser = pd.Series([1.0, 2.0, np.nan])\r\n>>> psser = ps.from_pandas(pser)\r\n>>> pser.ne(pser)\r\n0    False\r\n1    False\r\n2     True\r\ndtype: bool\r\n>>> psser.ne(psser)\r\n0    False\r\n1    False\r\n2     None\r\ndtype: bool\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe expect `True` for non-equal case, but it returns `None` in Spark Connect. So we should cast `None` to `True` for `ne`.\r\n\r\n**For `eq`:**\r\n```python\r\n>>> pser = pd.Series([1.0, 2.0, np.nan])\r\n>>> psser = ps.from_pandas(pser)\r\n>>> pser.eq(pser)\r\n0     True\r\n1     True\r\n2    False\r\ndtype: bool\r\n>>> psser.eq(psser)\r\n0     True\r\n1     True\r\n2     None\r\ndtype: bool\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe expect `False` for non-equal case, but it returns `None` in Spark Connect. So we should cast `None` to `False` for `eq`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, `NullOps.eq`, `NullOps.ne`, `NumOps.eq`, `NumOps.ne` are now working as expected on Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUncomment the UTs, tested manually for vanilla PySpark.\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-08T11:45:14Z","updated_at":"2023-11-20T01:35:20Z","closed_at":"2023-06-14T00:38:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0ad69b32685c4b87b4344a460cd7f51194b0dee2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to move several data files used for PySpark artifact tests from `connector/connect/common/src/test/resources/artifact-tests`, added in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40368, to `data` directory.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPySpark tests should better not depend on Spark's test package build. This PR decouples it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI in this PR should verify

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to invoke `getStatus()` instead of `get()` of `BlockManager` in `SparkConnectArtifactStatusesHandler` because `get()` acquires

`com.google.protobuf`, there are some [well known wrapper types](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/src/google/protobuf/wrappers.proto), useful for distinguishing between absence of primitive fields and their default values, as well as for use within `google.protobuf.Any` types. These types are:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDoubleValue\r\nFloatValue\r\nInt64Value\r\nUint64Value\r\nInt32Value\r\nUint32Value\r\nBoolValue\r\nStringValue\r\nBytesValue\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, when we deserialize these from a serialized protobuf into a spark struct, we expand them as if they were normal messages. Concretely, if we have\r\n\r\n```\r\nsyntax = \"proto3\";\r\n\r\nimport \"google/protobuf/wrappers.proto\"\r\n\r\nmessage WktExample {\r\n  google.protobuf.BoolValue bool_val = 1;\r\n  google.protobuf.Int32Value int32_val = 2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd a message like\r\n\r\n```\r\nWktExample(true, 100)\r\n```\r\nThen the behavior today is to deserialize this as.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"bool_val\": {\"value\": true}, \"int32_val\": {\"value\": 100}}\r\n```\r\nThis is quite difficult to work with and not in the spirit of the wrapper type, so it would be nice to deserialize as\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"bool_val\": true, \"int32_val\": 100}\r\n```\r\nThis is also the behavior by other popular deserialization libraries, including java protobuf util [Jsonformat](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/java/util/src/main/java/com/google/protobuf/util/JsonFormat.java#L904-L914) and golangs [jsonpb](https://github.com/gogo/protobuf/blob/master/jsonpb/jsonpb.go#L207-L214).\r\n\r\nSo for consistency with other libraries and improved usability, I propose we deserialize well known types in this way.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImproved usability and consistency with other deserialization libraries.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, deserialization of well known types will change from the struct format to the inline format.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a unit test testing every well known type deserialization explicitly, as well as testing

Previous behaviour\r\n\r\nPreviously, we kept `JobArtifactSet` and leveraged thread local for each client.\r\n\r\n1. The execution block is wrapped with `SessionHolder.withSession` [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/connector/connect/server/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connect/service/SparkConnectStreamHandler.scala#L53).\r\n2. `SessionHolder.withContextClassLoader` is then called [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/connector/connect/server/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connect/service/SessionHolder.scala#L130) which in turn calls `JobArtifactSet.withActive` [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/connector/connect/server/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connect/service/SessionHolder.scala#L118) and sets the active set to `SessionHolder.connectJobArtifactSet`\r\n3. The actual `JobArtifactSet` that is used is built up [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/connector/connect/server/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connect/artifact/SparkConnectArtifactManager.scala#L157) in `SparkConnectArtifactManager.jobArtifactSet`\r\n\r\nSince each client has their own `JobArtifactSet` made `active` when executing an operation, the `TaskDescription` would have artifacts specific to that client and subsequently, `IsolatedSessionState` in Executor. Therefore, we were able to separate the Spark Connect specific logic to the Spark Connect module.\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nMainly it was all good; however, the problem is that we don't call `SparkContext.addFile` or `SparkContext.addJar`, but we just pass it directly at the scheduler (to `TaskDescription`). This is fine in general but exposes several problems by not directly calling `SparkContext.addFile`:\r\n\r\n- `SparkContext.postEnvironmentUpdate` is not invoked at `SparkContext.addFile` which matters in, for example, recording the events for History Server.\r\n- Specifically for archives, `Utils.unpack(source, dest)` is not invoked at `SparkContext.addFile` in order to untar properly in the Driver.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we should duplicate those logics in Spark Connect server side, which is not ideal.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we already added the isolation logic into the Executor. Driver and Executor are the symmetry (not Spark Connect Server <> Executor). Therefore, it matters about code readability, and expectation in their roles.\r\n\r\n### Solution in this PR\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to support session-based files and archives in Spark Connect. This PR leverages the basework for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41701 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41625 (for jars in Spark Connect Scala client).\r\n\r\nThe changed logic is as follows:\r\n\r\n- Keep the session UUID, and Spark Connect Server specific information such as REPL class path within a thread local.\r\n- Add session ID when we add files or archives. `SparkContext` keeps them with a map `Map(session -> Map(file and timestamp))` in order to reuse the existing logic to address the problem mentioned\r\n\r\nAfter that, on executor side, \r\n\r\n- Executors create additional directory, named by session UUID, on the top of the default directory (that is the current working directory, see `SparkFiles.getRootDirectory`).\r\n- When we execute Python workers, it sets the current working directory to the one created above.\r\n- End users access to these files via using the current working directory e.g., `./blahblah.txt` in their Python UDF. Therefore, compatible with/without Spark Connect.\r\n\r\nNote that:\r\n- Here it creates Python workers for individual session because we set the session UUID as an environment variable, and we create new Python workers if environment variables are different, see also `SparkEnv.createPythonWorker`\r\n- It already kills the daemon and Python workers if they are not used for a while.\r\n\r\n### TODOs and limitations\r\n\r\nExecutor also maintains the file list but with a cache so it can evict the cache. However, it has a problem - It works as follows:\r\n- New `IsolatedSessionState` is created.\r\n- Task is executed once, and `IsolatedSessionState` holds the file list.\r\n- Later `IsolatedSessionState` is evicted at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41625/files#diff-d7a989c491f3cb77cca02c701496a9e2a3443f70af73b0d1ab0899239f3a789dR187\r\n- Executor will create a new `IsolatedSessionState` with empty file lists.\r\n- Executor will attempt to redownload and overwrite the files (see https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/executor/Executor.scala#L1058-L1064)\r\n- `spark.files.overwrite` is `false` by default. So the task will suddenly fail at this point.\r\n\r\nPossible solutions are:\r\n- For 1., we should maintain a cache with TTL, and remove them\r\n- For 2. we should have a dedicated directory (which this PR does) and remove the directory away when the cache is evicted. So the overwrite does not happen \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order to allow session-based artifact control and multi tenancy.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this PR now allows multiple sessions to have their own space.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUse the compression codec set by the user when write compact log.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, if enable rolling log in SHS, only `originalFilePath` is used to determine the path of compact file.\r\n\r\n    override val logPath: String = originalFilePath.toUri.toString + EventLogFileWriter.COMPACTED\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the user set `spark.eventLog.compression.codec` in sparkConf and it is different from the default value of spark conf, when the log compact logic is triggered, the old event log file will be compacted and use the default value of spark conf.\r\n\r\n    protected val compressionCodec =\r\n      if (shouldCompress) {\r\n      Some(CompressionCodec.createCodec(sparkConf, sparkConf.get(EVENT_LOG_COMPRESSION_CODEC)))\r\n    } else {\r\n      None\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private[history] val compressionCodecName = compressionCodec.map { c =>\r\n      CompressionCodec.getShortName(c.getClass.getName)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, The compression codec used by `EventLogFileReader` to read log is split from the log path, this will lead to EventLogFileReader can not read the compacted log file normally.\r\n\r\n    def codecName(log: Path): Option[String] = {\r\n      // Compression codec is encoded as an extension, e.g. app_123.lzf\r\n      // Since we sanitize the app ID to not include periods, it is safe to split on it\r\n      val logName = log.getName.stripSuffix(COMPACTED).stripSuffix(IN_PROGRESS)\r\n      logName.split(\"\\\\.\").tail.lastOption\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nSo we should override the `shouldCompress` and `compressionCodec` variable in class `CompactedEventLogFileWriter`, use the compression codec set by the user.\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-07T08:46:42Z","updated_at":"2023-10-07T00:17:07Z","closed_at":"2023-10-07T00:17:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0bfbf995d49fe0a773965646bf881ffede280d29","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41491/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41491/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41491/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/854b8c08891e7b8366bb4e418b8538aab9c9a8c0","head":{"label":"shuyouZZ:SPARK-43991","ref":"SPARK-43991","sha":"854b8c08891e7b8366bb4e418b8538aab9c9a8c0","user":{"login":"shuyouZZ","id":43948673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTQ4Njcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43948673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuyouZZ","html_url":"https://github.com/shuyouZZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuyouZZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuyouZZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuyouZZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuyouZZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuyouZZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuyouZZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuyouZZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuyouZZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuyouZZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":482147805,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLz93Q","name":"spark","full_name":"shuyouZZ/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shuyouZZ","id":43948673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTQ4Njcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43948673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuyouZZ","html_url":"https://github.com/shuyouZZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuyouZZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuyouZZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuyouZZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuyouZZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuyouZZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuyouZZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuyouZZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuyouZZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuyouZZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shuyouZZ/spark","description":"Apache

If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn this PR, we proposed to separate finalizeShuffleMerge processing into dedicated thread pools.\r\n1. We introduce `ShuffleTransportContext` extend `TransportContext`.\r\n2. We override the  `initializePipeline` by adding `FinalizeHandler` when the newly added configuration `spark.shuffle.server.finalizeShuffleMergeThreads` is positive.\r\n3. We override the `decode` within `ShuffleMessageDecoder` so that an  `FINALIZE_SHUFFLE_MERGE` type `RpcRequest` will not be processed by current IO threads. We will further encapsulate it as `RpcRequestInternal`. \r\n4. A dedicated `FinalizedHandler` will be attached to the channel pipeline, which only handles `RpcRequestInternal` type.\r\n\r\nauthors: @otterc @shuwang21 \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  5. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn our production environment, `finalizeShuffleMerge` processing took longer time (p90 is around 20s) than other PRC requests. This is due to `finalizeShuffleMerge` invoking IO operations like truncate and file open/close.  \r\n\r\nMore importantly, processing this `finalizeShuffleMerge` can block other critical lightweight messages like authentications, which can cause authentication timeout as well as fetch failures. Those timeout and fetch failures affect the stability of the Spark job executions. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n1. We add a few related UTs.\r\n2. We also tested internally with this patch. Under the same setting, without this patch, the shuffle server can encounter authentication timeouts thus fetch failures.  With this path, `finalizeShuffleMerge` is processed by  `finalizeHandler` we introduced, and authentication RPC requests are not blocked.\r\n3. In terms of performance, we have deployed internally. We saw Shuffle fetch delays have improved. P80 is reduced by 98.1% (120 s to 2.3 s). P90 is reduced by 83% (30mins to ~5mins). P99 is reduced by by 70% (44h to 13h). Furthermore, we saw The SASL timeout exceptions are reduced by ~40%. Spark job runtime is also improved. P50 is reduced by 35.2% (164s to 107s). P80 is reduced by 50.1% (15 mins s to 7.7mins). P90 is reduced by 45.5% (37 mins to 20 mins). P99 is reduced by 10% (4.5h to 4.0h). Finally, less runtime also indicates resources saving, and we are seeing 20% resources saving.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change adds support for user-provided initialization vectors (IVs) or authenticated additional data (AAD) to `aes_encrypt` / `aes_decrypt`. 12-byte IVs may optionally be passed if the mode is \"GCM\" and 16-byte IVs may be passed if the mode is \"CBC\". An arbitrary binary value may be passed as additional authenticated data only if \"GCM\" mode is used.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCallers may wish to provide their own IV values so that the output ciphertext matches a ciphertext generated outside of Spark. AAD is used to bind some input to a ciphertext and ensure that it is presented during decryption -- often used to scope an operation to a specific context.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this change introduces two optional parameters to `aes_encrypt` and one optional parameter to `aes_decrypt`:\r\n```\r\naes_encrypt(expr, key[, mode[, padding[, iv[, aad]]]])\r\naes_decrypt(expr, key[, mode[, padding[, iv]]])\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameFunctionsSuite -- -z

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSPARK-43331 added two new test cases in `ClientE2ETestSuite`:\r\n- interrupt all - background queries, foreground interrupt\r\n- interrupt all -

`ClientE2ETestSuite` implicitly import some classes from `spark-connect-client-jvm.jar`, such as `org.apache.spark.sql.connect.client.SparkResult`, so when run the maven test as

exist during Maven testing. So this PR chooses to move these two test cases to a separate file to pass Maven test.\r\n\r\nsbt test is not failed by this because the classpath of sbt submitted `SimpleSparkConnectService` will include connect client module, this is different from Maven, so GitHub Actions can passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake `interrupt all - background queries, foreground interrupt` and `interrupt all - foreground queries, background interrupt` can test pass using maven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, just for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, when deserializing protobufs with `enums.as.ints` set to true, repeated enum fields will raise an exception. This is because the UnsafeArrayData type (which is the array type for primitives) does not support the `.set` method, and we should instead use `.setInt`. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFixes a bug in the current code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests were added to highlight this use case.","created_at":"2023-06-06T15:08:51Z","updated_at":"2023-06-07T03:06:27Z","closed_at":"2023-06-07T03:06:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b4f1355e3decbe338fcbf05b95fc9c8e84d677fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4654282764,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABFWq4DA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PROTOBUF","name":"PROTOBUF","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41481/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41481/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41481/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3a550f7d1bb1c8b63475abaa5f88c30813b5c0e3","head":{"label":"justaparth:parth/fix-enums-as-ints-bug","ref":"parth/fix-enums-as-ints-bug","sha":"3a550f7d1bb1c8b63475abaa5f88c30813b5c0e3","user":{"login":"justaparth","id":1002986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI5ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth","html_url":"https://github.com/justaparth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":610834975,"node_id":"R_kgDOJGiaHw","name":"spark","full_name":"justaparth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"justaparth","id":1002986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI5ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth","html_url":"https://github.com/justaparth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/justaparth/spark","description":"Apache

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nHandle the `exception` message from Structured Streaming's `QueryTerminatedEvent` in `StreamingQueryStatusListener`, so that the Structured Streaming UI can display the status and error message correctly for failed queries.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe original implementation of the Structured Streaming UI had a copy-and-paste bug where it forgot to handle the `exception` from `QueryTerminatedEvent` in `StreamingQueryStatusListener.onQueryTerminated`, so that field is never updated in the UI data, i.e. it's always `None`. In turn, the UI would always show the status of failed queries as `FINISHED` instead of `FAILED`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Failed Structured Streaming queries would show incorrectly as `FINISHED` before the fix:\r\n![Screenshot 2023-06-05 at 3 58 16 PM](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/107834/32d91148-7a27-4723-9748-ec8a7596ee61)\r\nand show correctly as `FAILED` after the fix:\r\n![Screenshot 2023-06-05 at 3 56 07 PM](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/107834/16b1df32-1804-4f49-aede-d775f8db7666)\r\n\r\nThe example query is:\r\n```scala\r\nimplicit val ctx = spark.sqlContext\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.MemoryStream\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\", \"true\")\r\nval inputData = MemoryStream[(Int, Int)]\r\nval df = inputData.toDF().selectExpr(\"_1 / _2 as a\")\r\ninputData.addData((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 0))\r\nval testQuery = df.writeStream.format(\"memory\").queryName(\"kristest\").outputMode(\"append\").start\r\ntestQuery.processAllAvailable()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason for the test failure is that the Maven test used shaded spark-protobuf jar, and the `Message` type `StorageLevel` used for testing inherited from `com.google.protobuf.Message` instead of `org.sparkproject.spark_protobuf.protobuf.Message`.\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions can pass due to sbt test always used non-assembly park-protobuf jar, the `com.google.protobuf.Message`  class has not been relocated.\r\n\r\nSo this pr references the patterns of `kafka-0-10/kafka-0-10-assembly` and `kinesis-asl/kinesis-asl-assembly`, splitting `spark-protobuf` module into `spark-protobuf` and `spark-protobuf-assembly`, and make connect server module always use `spark-protobuf` for testing to maintain the same behavior as sbt testing.\r\n\r\nWith this pr, the above maven test commands will pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake connect server module can test pass using maven.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, user needs to use spark-protobuf-assembly jar instead of the previous spark-protobuf jar.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass Github Actions\r\n- Manual check \r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn clean install -DskipTests\r\nbuild/mvn test -pl connector/connect/server\r\n```\r\n\r\nall test passed after this pr.\r\n\r\n- Manual check the the contents of the jar, the content of `spark-protobuf-assembly` and `spark-protobuf(without this pr)` is the same, and `spark-protobuf(with this pr)` is no longer

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to extend Artifact API of the Python connect client by two new methods similarly to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40827:\r\n1. `is_cached_artifact()` checks the cache of the given hash presents at the server side.\r\n2. `cache_artifact()` caches a blob in memory at the server side.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo allow creating a dataframe from a large local collection. `spark.createDataFrame(...)` fails with the following error w/o the changes:\r\n```python\r\npyspark.errors.exceptions.connect.SparkConnectGrpcException: <_MultiThreadedRendezvous of RPC that terminated with:\r\n\tstatus = StatusCode.RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED\r\n\tdetails = \"Sent message larger than max (629146388 vs. 134217728)\"\r\n\tdebug_error_string = \"UNKNOWN:Error received from peer localhost:58218 {grpc_message:\"Sent message larger than max (629146388 vs.

tested?\r\nBy running new tests:\r\n```\r\n$ python/run-tests --parallelism=1 --testnames 'pyspark.sql.tests.connect.client.test_artifact

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`SparkConnectStreamHandler` treats the proto requests from connect client and send the responses back to connect client. `SparkConnectStreamHandler` holds a component `StreamObserver` to send responses. Currently, SparkConnectPlanner also knows `StreamObserver` passed by method parameters. So the behavior introduces some issues.\r\n\r\n- Visibility\r\n\r\n`SparkConnectStreamHandler` holds the `StreamObserver` and shouldn't expose it. Now, we expose `StreamObserver` to `SparkConnectPlanner` and the latter is public, so every developers could use it.\r\n\r\n- Safety\r\n\r\nBased on the visibility issue, this is usually not a secure strategy.\r\n\r\n- Code Design\r\n\r\nBecause `SparkConnectStreamHandler` is fully responsible for responding to RPC, which is a division of responsibilities in good programming. The better code design, the easier to extend function.\r\n\r\nSo I think we should keep the `StreamObserver` could be accessed only with `SparkConnectStreamHandler`.\r\nThis PR wraps the detail of `StreamObserver` into `SparkConnectStreamHandler`, `SparkConnectPlanner` only need call `sendResponse` if the response is ready.\r\n\r\nThis PR want decouple the process handle commands and the other process send responses on server side.\r\n\r\nNote: As we disscussed on https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41379, this PR doesn't delay to send any response \"right now\" and expects that it will be returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDecouple handle command and send response on server side.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nJust

The script was created using the `openai` Python library from OpenAI, and minimal review was conducted by author after executing the script. The five improved error messages were selected by the author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor improving errors to make them more actionable and usable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo API changes, only error message improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe existing CI should
