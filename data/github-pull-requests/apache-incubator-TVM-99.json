PR fixes two things for some tf models in the format of saved model:\r\n1. Make fill not depend on node attr ```_output_shapes``` since we can always get that by trying to ```_infer_value```. Some saved model will generate unknown rank shape for this attr which is actually not true.\r\n2. Add output nodes as ```protected_nodes``` when parsing saved models so that they won't be removed in removing training nodes process.\r\n\r\n@yongwww @lixiaoquan @zhiics

sure if there is a deeper reason not to concatenate for dense, too, but maybe there

the existing calibration pass, it only returns the module that is built from the main function. However, the input can have more than one functions (e.g., after using BYOC). This PR provides a quick fix by setting the function dictionary of `from_expr`.\r\n\r\nFollowing is a case where the existing pass would go wrong but is fixed by this PR.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef test_extern_dnnl_mobilenet():\r\n    if not tvm.get_global_func(\"relay.ext.dnnl\", True):\r\n        print(\"skip because DNNL codegen is not available\")\r\n        return\r\n \r\n    dtype = 'float32'\r\n    ishape = (1, 3, 224, 224)\r\n    mod, params = relay.testing.mobilenet.get_workload(\r\n        batch_size=1, dtype='float32')\r\n \r\n \r\n    mod = transform.AnnotateTarget([\"dnnl\"])(mod)\r\n    mod = transform.MergeCompilerRegions()(mod)\r\n    mod = transform.PartitionGraph()(mod)\r\n \r\n    with relay.quantize.qconfig(skip_conv_layers=[]):\r\n        mod = relay.quantize.quantize(mod, params)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, with this current fix, we still only run the calibration pass on the main function instead of all input functions. In the future, we may need to consider applying the analysis to all functions.\r\n\r\nI also did a quick check on other passes to see if there exist similar issues but I think this is the only pass.\r\n\r\n@comaniac @zhiics @anijain2305 please take a look.

The object detection models need an increased tolerance of 1e-4 to pass.\r\n\r\nI do both in one go because the new gelu necessitates and is tested by the tightened testing tolerance.\r\n\r\nI had to

finally had time to work on it again so this is a re-attempt at https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4318, which was reverted.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor some context the tvm meaning for output_padding is to pad the output shape with zeros.\r\n\r\nFor every other deep learning framework, this parameter name is used to disambiguate between the possible output shapes in the presence of padding (Unless they have an explicit output_shape parameter like tensorflow, which doesn't have output_padding).\r\n\r\nThe current behaviour is in my mind redundant since you can always zero-pad manually if you need to. Also there is no way to compute the gradient of a convolution with strides that did not have the minimum possible input shape.\r\n\r\nThe new behaviour makes this possible and brings us in-line with the other frameworks.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI've rebased the code and added checks to make sure an invalid output_padding is refused.\r\n\r\nAs for the comments by @icemelon9:\r\n\r\n1) The aformentioned check should cover that case and prevent going out of bounds.\r\n2) Since the preprocess function handles everything that we need output_padding for, we don't need to pass it forward.\r\n\r\nMy best guess for why the CI didn't catch the cases is that going just a little bit out of bounds (like off by one) is unlikely to trigger any memory problems.","created_at":"2020-06-09T19:33:08Z","updated_at":"2020-06-30T07:05:56Z","closed_at":"2020-06-30T07:05:44Z","merged_at":"2020-06-30T07:05:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"bc22fb9dd9edaec263bcfa03290ad1d963ce3f56","assignee":{"login":"vinx13","id":7195739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13","html_url":"https://github.com/vinx13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"vinx13","id":7195739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13","html_url":"https://github.com/vinx13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

interprets float as float64. As we drop to numpy for determining what a dtype argument means, this means we inadvertently create float64 consts.

the HalideIR's design, DSL components and IR are mixed together.\r\nFor example, Call::Halide can containa reference to a function \r\nconstructed in the tensor expression language(DSL) stage.\r\n\r\nWhile this coupled design simplifies certain aspect of the DSL construction,\r\nit prevents the low-level IR to evolve as a clean standalone IR:\r\n\r\n- The additional tensor expression provided in the function is opaque to the IR\r\n  and may become obsolete as we transform them.\r\n- The duplication of the information in the DSL tensor and IR makes it hard to\r\n  design a stand-alone text format (when there are elements shared in the tensor\r\n  expression and normal statements).\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to clearly de-couple the TIR from high-level DSL structures(tensor expression),\r\nwhile still provide clear extensions to build DSLs on top of the TIR.\r\n\r\nWe introduce a DataProducer as a base class for high level tensor expressions objects\r\nthat produce data. We then introduce ProducerLoad to replace the Call::Halide usage,\r\nso that the Call node can always be self contained and used for low-level calls.\r\n\r\nThe high-level tensor expression DSL can still generate a PrimExpr that contains a ProducerLoad.\r\nThese PrimExprs contains fragments of information that can be combined together to\r\ngenerate a low-level TIR PrimFunc.\r\n\r\nWe also state clearly that DataProducer **should not** appear in any TIR PrimFunc.\r\nInstead, the high-level DSL layer should lowered DataProducers to Buffers and TIR statements\r\nthat produces these buffers. We can further provide verifications to validate such invariance.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Introduce DataProducer to serve as a base class for Tensor in tensor expressions.\r\n- Migrate use of Call::Halide to ProducerLoad\r\n- Migrate the other usages of Calls.\r\n\r\nWe will also create follow-up PRs to migrate the remaining two DSL related IR nodes(Realize/Provide)\r\nto use the DataProducer.\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-06T22:22:31Z","updated_at":"2020-06-07T21:11:06Z","closed_at":"2020-06-07T21:11:06Z","merged_at":"2020-06-07T21:11:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"6ae439c8c58dd0118d2f2c5d1c4bcb650df47104","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5743/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5743/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5743/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/a5f9ca8080d35c57dfdd4df7833ad8c46393c150","head":{"label":"tqchen:tir","ref":"tir","sha":"a5f9ca8080d35c57dfdd4df7833ad8c46393c150","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100638323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA2MzgzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"tqchen/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen/tvm","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/{archive_format}{/ref}","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqch

discussion: https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/discuss-runtime-array-containers-array-adt-string/4582.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces `tvm::Map` and `tvm::MapNode`:\r\n1) `MapNode` is a POD-C compliant alternative to `std::unordered_map<ObjectRef, ObjectRef>;\r\n2) `Map` is the shared reference to the container which implements copy-on-write semantics.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Removes dependency to std::unordered_map\r\n* The new impl is POD-C compatible in terms of Itanium C++ ABI\r\n* Copy-on-write semantic is preserved in `tvm::Map`\r\n* `tvm::MapNode` is kept to be mutable and iterable\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n* `MapNode` no longer has the field `std::unordered_map<ObjectRef, ObjectRef> data`, and all its methods currently used are implemented to `MapNode` itself\r\n* Iterating through `MapNode` is natively supported directly via interfaces like `MapNode::begin()`\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\nTo show that the introduction of `tvm::Map` won't hurt performance, I also did some rough benchmark on my laptop on the success insertion performance.\r\n\r\nHardware: MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019)\r\nMemory: 8 GB * 2, DDR4, 2667 MHz\r\nCPU: Intel i7-9750H CPU @

We learned that triangle numbers that could iterate through the power-of-2-sized table through [2]. The idea that linked list can be placed in the same table is learned from [3].\r\n\r\n[1] Fibonacci Hashing: https://programmingpraxis.com/2018/06/19/fibonacci-hash/\r\n[2] Quadratic probing with

#5429, it requires the new shape of `relay.reshape` can only be either `int`, `Tuple[int, ...]`, `List[int]`, or `Expr`. However, a use case in ARM conv2d alter layout passes `Tuple[int, int, Expr, int]` that violates the reshape spec.\r\n\r\nConsidering `CO` and `VC` should be constants at this moment, it should be safe to directly use division.\r\n\r\n@icemelon9 please help verify.\r\n\r\ntl; dr\r\nThe root cause is the new added `const` call in reshape. This statement tries to convert a list type of new shape to `Expr` by calling `const(newshape)`. Specifically, it does the following:\r\n\r\n1. Make a numpy array.\r\n2. Refer to the numpy array type and shape to create an empty NDArray.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that a list `[3, 3, idxd(10, 2), 4]` will become an object type numpy array, which NDArray.empty cannot

adds casts the input from `T` type to `U` type so that the computation is done in `U` type, and then casts the output back to `T`.

couple of cuda codegen tests which were useful in verifying the rocm functioning. I'm not quite sure what to do with that. Having rocm tests in test_target_codegen_cuda might not be intuitive, but code duplication is bad, too. The tests helped find the above hardcoded 32 threads.\r\n- This is my first meddling with intrinsics and producing expressions, so bear with me.\r\n\r\nIt is built on #5726 because I needed that out

discussion in this PR, here is the current changelog:\r\n\r\n- Add `is_expr`, `is_constant`, `is_tuple`, and `is_tuple_get_item` APIs. As a result, users will not directly call `XXPattern` anymore.\r\n- Rename `is_input` to `is_var` to against `is_constant`.\r\n- Add dataflow pattern to doc/api.\r\n- Fix all type annotations in `__init__.py`.\r\n\r\n=== ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION ===\r\n\r\nFor each pattern node, we define `XXPattern` Python class for the FFI connection. We also define a user-friendly API such as `is_op` to have better user experience. Since `is_XX` APIs are just wrappers to the corresponding `XXPattern` class, this PR simplifies their implementations by turning the APIs to function aliases.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR also makes the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. Add `is_expr`, `is_constant`, `is_tuple`, and `is_tuple_get_item` APIs. As a result, users will not directly call `XXPattern` anymore.\r\n2. Rename `is_input` to `is_var` to against `is_constant`.\r\n\r\n@mbrookhart I'm not quite sure if the second change makes sense to you or not so I intentionally separate it to the second commit. If you prefer `is_input`, I could just simply revert it.\r\n\r\nAlso cc @masahi

PR does a major refactor for TensorFlow control flow and tensor array parsing logic:\r\n\r\n1. Follow the logic of loop invariant code motion to directly lift any out-of-loop nodes as loop variable. This is a general method better than previous structure hash matching method.\r\n2. Optimize static tensor array shape generation.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, TensorFlow frontend should be able to generally support control flow and tensor array, and user can compile TensorFlow object detection model with VM compilation.\r\n\r\nSSD test requires https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/5757.\r\n\r\n@tqchen @zhiics @wweic @yongwww @lixiaoquan

here:\r\n\r\n1. [BUGFIX] ```C``` is one element of zero value (e.g. mxnet ```Dense(use_bias=False)``` exports).\r\n2. [OPTIMIZATION] ```beta==0```, so we can skip the addition (usually of a bias vector).\r\n\r\n**Cases**\r\n\r\nIn case of 1. without this fix:\r\n```\r\n  %11 = multiply(1f, %bias11) an internal invariant was violated while typechecking your program Check failed: t0->dtype == t1->dtype (float32 vs. int64)\r\n```\r\nor worse (fixing type casts) we get size issues (```C``` is more like a constant instead of vector):\r\n```\r\n%12 = nn.bias_add(%10, %11) unable to unify: `Tensor[(512), float32]` and `Tensor[(1), int64]`;\r\n```\r\n\r\n@siju-samuel @masahi @FrozenGene  please help with

whom it may concern,\r\n    Hello, I am learning tvm and trying to write some training model with relay when I got an error in `dense_grad()` with the size of data(`5*4`) and weight(`3*4`). Furthermore, I found that it may be caused by a small bug in dense_grad():\r\n\r\nthe present dense_grad() is:\r\n```python\r\n@register_gradient(\"nn.dense\")\r\ndef dense_grad(orig, grad):\r\n    \"\"\"Returns [grad' @ weight, data @ grad']\"\"\"\r\n    data, weight = orig.args\r\n    return [collapse_sum_like(transpose(grad) * weight, data),\r\n            collapse_sum_like(data * transpose(grad), weight)]\r\n```\r\nin a common situation, when we calculate the gradient of `dense(A(i * j), weight(k * j))`, we get grad matrix with size `i * k`, so in above `dense_grad()`, the first multiply operator get parameters with size `k * i` and `k * j`, the second one get paramenters with size `i * j` and `k * i`, so we can only avoid conflict when `i == j == k` or some of them are `1`. \r\nTo increase the robustness of the function, maybe we can modify it to:\r\n```python\r\n@register_gradient(\"nn.dense\")\r\ndef dense_grad(orig, grad):\r\n    \"\"\"Returns [grad' @ weight, data @ grad']\"\"\"\r\n    data, weight = orig.args\r\n    return [collapse_sum_like(_nn.dense(grad, transpose(weight)), data),\r\n            collapse_sum_like(_nn.dense(transpose(grad), transpose(data)), weight)]\r\n```\r\nwe change multiply(`*`) to `_nn.dense` so that it can handel matrix multiply as well. For above assumption, the first `_nn.dense()` get parameters with size `i * k` and `j * k` and give a result with size `i * j`, which is the same as `data`; the second one get parameters with size `k * i` and `j * i` and give a result with size `k * j`, which is the same as `weight`. We add an extra test case in test_dense_grad() to test its correctness.\r\nI am just starting to learn about tvm, so I apologize if I miss some obvious things. Thank you very much!","created_at":"2020-05-29T12:01:00Z","updated_at":"2020-06-06T03:40:18Z","closed_at":"2020-06-06T03:40:18Z","merged_at":"2020-06-06T03:40:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"2ec7caa073307b546aeea7787238ad4960898354","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5695/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5695/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5695/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/9e96bc6bbf2578945faf1d5dfc3ebe987462d1a3","head":{"label":"handar423:master","ref":"master","sha":"9e96bc6bbf2578945faf1d5dfc3ebe987462d1a3","user":{"login":"handar423","id":47707767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzA3NzY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47707767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/handar423","html_url":"https://github.com/handar423","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/handar423/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/handar423/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/handar423/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/handar423/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/handar423/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/handar423/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/handar423/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/handar423/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/handar423/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":267754758,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjc3NTQ3NTg=","name":"incubator-tvm","full_name":"handar423/incubator-tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"handar423","id":47707767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzA3NzY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47707767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/handar423","html_url":"https://github.com/handar423","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/handar423/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/handar423/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/handar423/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/handar423/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/handar423/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/handar423/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/handar423/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/handar423/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/handar423/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/handar423/incubator-tvm","description":"Open

up from conversation in #5689, this PR implements these rules for lifting or embedding constants in Partitioned Functions:\r\n\r\n- Pattern input ExprPattern(relay.const):\r\n     - Only match constant nodes that contain the same constant value and embed them in the partitioned functions. In this case, the arguments of partitioned functions will be reduced.\r\n- Pattern input ConstantPattern:\r\n     - Only match constant nodes and embed them in the partitioned functions. In this case, the arguments of partitioned functions will be reduced.\r\n- Pattern input VarPattern('x'):\r\n     - Match only the var node with an optional specified name hint. In this case, the arguments of partitioned function is fixed.\r\n- Pattern input wildcard:\r\n     - Match anything. In this case, the arguments of partitioned function is fixed.\r\n- Pattern AltPattern:\r\n     - Match either lhs or rhs. depending on which side matched, recursively apply this matching logic and embed constants appropriately based on the contained pattern.\r\n\r\ncc @comaniac @mbaret @masahi
