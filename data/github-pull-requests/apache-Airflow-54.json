some warnings in tests, in current implementation we add error filter before start the test but when `@pytest.mark.filterwarnings` already add filter into the `warning.filters` in this case this code still raise an error\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@pytest.mark.filterwarnings(\"ignore::airflow.exceptions.RemovedInAirflow3Warning\")\r\ndef test_suite():\r\n    warnings.warn(\"Surprise Surprise\", category=RemovedInAirflow3Warning)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe solution pretty simple add appropriate markers during the tests collection, when test item just collected, and add it before all explicitly set markers. in this case the order of marker execution would be same as this code\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@pytest.mark.filterwarnings(\"ignore::airflow.exceptions.RemovedInAirflow3Warning\")\r\n@pytest.mark.filterwarnings(\"error::airflow.exceptions.RemovedInAirflow3Warning\")\r\n@pytest.mark.filterwarnings(\"error::airflow.utils.context.AirflowContextDeprecationWarning\")\r\n@pytest.mark.filterwarnings(\"error::airflow.exceptions.AirflowProviderDeprecationWarning\")\r\ndef test_suite():\r\n    warnings.warn(\"Surprise Surprise\", category=RemovedInAirflow3Warning)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich turned into the this order into the `warning.filters`\r\n\r\n```\r\n00 = {tuple: 5} ('ignore', None, <class 'airflow.exceptions.RemovedInAirflow3Warning'>, None, 0)\r\n01 = {tuple: 5} ('error', None, <class 'airflow.exceptions.RemovedInAirflow3Warning'>, None, 0)\r\n02 = {tuple: 5} ('error', None, <class 'airflow.utils.context.AirflowContextDeprecationWarning'>, None, 0)\r\n03 = {tuple: 5} ('error', None, <class 'airflow.exceptions.AirflowProviderDeprecationWarning'>, None, 0)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've check this behaviour in both pytest 7.4 and pytest 8.1+\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

have now a separate job that prepares and uploads artifacts when PROD image is being prepared for K8S testing. This saves a bit of time to prepare PROD image. However this step had a bug - it checked out the `main` version of code when preparing airflow and provider packages, so it was really testing the \"previous\" merge not the \"current\" PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR switches the job to prepare artifacts to use the same checkout strategy as the other build-image workflow jobs.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Why\r\nFor some operators such as [S3KeySensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/8246a892b26c8fbe9c00858027ca4a741da5b523/airflow/providers/amazon/aws/sensors/s3.py#L150-L156) with deferrable set to True, running `execute` method in workers might not be necessary. It would be better if we could have a way to run a task in triggerer directly without going into the worker. \r\n\r\nIn the current solution, we still need to run `next_method/execute_complete` in the worker. This PR serves as a POC / first step of running the whole execution in triggerer in asyncronize manner.\r\n\r\n## What\r\nIntroduce `_start_trigger` and `_next_method` to `BaseOperator`. If an operator defines both `_start_trigger` and `_next_method` in the `__init__` method, the scheduler will directly defer the task without going to the worker.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom __future__ import annotations\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.models.baseoperator import BaseOperator\r\nfrom airflow.triggers.testing import SuccessTrigger\r\n\r\n\r\nclass StartFromTriggerOperator(BaseOperator):\r\n    _start_trigger = SuccessTrigger()\r\n    _next_method = \"execute_complete\"\r\n\r\n    def execute_complete(self, context, event=None) -> None:\r\n        self.log.info(\"execute complete\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese attributes can also be assigned at the instance level. However, dynamic task mapping is not supported in this setup. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

If you pause the DAGs at 3PM on January 31st and re-enable them at 3PM on February 2nd, [CronTriggerTimetable](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/authoring-and-scheduling/timetable.html#crontriggertimetable) skips the DAG runs which are supposed to trigger on February 1st and 2nd. The next DAG run will be triggered at 12AM on February 3rd. [CronDataIntervalTimetable](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/authoring-and-scheduling/timetable.html#crondataintervaltimetable), on the other hand, skips the DAG runs which are supposed to trigger on February 1st only. A DAG run for February 2nd is immediately triggered after you re-enable the DAG.\r\n\r\nIn fact when a DAG using `CronTriggerTimetable` is enabled it istantly start without waiting for the next cron occurence. This PR fixes it by adding a \"next\" `start_time_candidate` if the found one is before current time.\r\n\r\nRelated to this discussion:

reached\")\r\n```\r\n---\r\n\r\nAn issue has been identified with the AWS provider code.\r\nThe `EmrOperator` that calls this trigger does not allow users to input `waiter_max_attempts`, resulting in the application of the default value of 600.\r\n\r\n`airflow/providers/amazon/aws/triggers/emr.py`\r\n```python\r\nclass EmrContainerTrigger(AwsBaseWaiterTrigger):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Poll for the status of EMR container until reaches terminal state.\r\n    :param virtual_cluster_id: Reference Emr cluster id\r\n    :param job_id:  job_id to check the state\r\n    :param aws_conn_id: Reference to AWS connection id\r\n    :param waiter_delay: polling period in seconds to check for the status\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n\r\n    def __init__(\r\n        self,\r\n        virtual_cluster_id: str,\r\n        job_id: str,\r\n        aws_conn_id: str | None = \"aws_default\",\r\n        poll_interval: int | None = None,  # deprecated\r\n        waiter_delay: int = 30,\r\n        waiter_max_attempts: int = 600,   # <- We can't modify this ..\r\n    ):\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words, if the `poll_interval` is set to 60 seconds, the job will terminate after 10 hours (1 minute * 600) regardless of the `waiter_max_attempts` value specified by the user. \r\n\r\nTo address this, modifications were made in `EmrOperator` to ensure that parameters provided by the user are also passed to the `EmrContainerTrigger`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

I was able to work this around by adding this change to extra and changing the HiveHook code but a better fix would be to add a new field called HA, which when selected, parses the connection better in the hook itself.\r\n\r\nI would like to propose adding this into the connection form for Hive CLI type in a better way. Recently some change was made to remove extra and integrate this into the form and simplify it: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/37043/.\r\nWould propose adding similar fields for HA and if enabled, the beeline command construction would vary slightly. \r\n\r\nMY HA URL looks somewhat like this btw: `jdbc:hive2://host1:port1,host2:port2,host3:port3/default;principal=hive/principal@REALM;serviceDiscoveryMode=zooKeeper;ssl=true;zooKeeperNamespace=hiveserver2`\r\n\r\nTested using a HA setting, beeline works as expected.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

on selective checks, but also on the job executed, we choose whether to run job on public runners or self-hosted runners. So far the set of labels to select the runners were passed in a bit inconsistent way. Outputs of selective checks can only be strings and the `run-as` accepts array of strings (labels) - so we were using fromJSON to convert between the two. And we used runs-on inputs on a number of our workflows to pass the selection.\r\n\r\nHowever this meant that runs-on could be either string or array and that sometimes we passed public/self-hosted labels as strings directly and some of those were hard-coded.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes it consistently across the board to introduce consistent approach:\r\n\r\n* build info have no selective checks results yet, so for them runs-on is hardcoded\r\n* similarly for \"windows\" and release jobs that are manually run without running selective checks\r\n* selective checks will produce three outuputs - JSON stringiified array of labels:\r\n   * default (one that is selected depending on who runs the build)\r\n   * public (for cases where we want to force the builds to use public runners\r\n   * self-hosted (for cases where we want to force the builds to use self-hosted runners\r\n* all the outputs are named `<type>-runs-on-as-string` to make it clear they are all strings\r\n* all inputs of workflows expectings strings are named the same (with as-string suffix and <type> prefix)\r\n* whenever a job is run, we pass \"runs-on\" parameter to be `fromJSON` with appropriate type we want to use passed as input\r\n\r\nThis will make it easier to reason on which job is using which type of runner and it will make it easier in the future to make it more flexible when we add ASF self-hosted runners and possibly our own K8S runners, or when we would want to change labels for public runners or self-hosted runners.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

transitions to the RUNNING state.\r\nBut the current ti.set_state method has set start_date even though the state is prior to RUNNING.\r\n\r\nThis creates an unstable situation where start_date is present in SCHEDULED and QUEUED ti generated by backfilling, but not in ti that is not.\r\n\r\nThis is an unnatural behavior for ti's state transitions, so we try to fix it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please

on selective checks, but also on the job executed, we choose whether to run job on public runners or self-hosted runners. So far the set of labels to select the runners were passed in a bit inconsistent way. Outputs of selective checks can only be strings and the `run-as` accepts array of strings (labels) - so we were using fromJSON to convert between the two. And we used runs-on inputs on a number of our workflows to pass the selection.\r\n\r\nHowever this meant that runs-on could be either string or array and that sometimes we passed public/self-hosted labels as strings directly and some of those were hard-coded.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes it consistently across the board to introduce consistent approach:\r\n\r\n* build info have no selective checks results yet, so for them runs-on is hardcoded\r\n* similarly for \"windows\" and release jobs that are manually run without running selective checks\r\n* selective checks will produce three outuputs - JSON stringiified array of labels:\r\n   * default (one that is selected depending on who runs the build)\r\n   * public (for cases where we want to force the builds to use public runners\r\n   * self-hosted (for cases where we want to force the builds to use self-hosted runners\r\n* all the outputs are named `<type>-runs-on-as-string` to make it clear they are all strings\r\n* all inputs of workflows expectings strings are named the same (with as-string suffix and <type> prefix)\r\n* whenever a job is run, we pass \"runs-on\" parameter to be `fromJSON` with appropriate type we want to use passed as input\r\n\r\nThis will make it easier to reason on which job is using which type of runner and it will make it easier in the future to make it more flexible when we add ASF self-hosted runners and possibly our own K8S runners, or when we would want to change labels for public runners or self-hosted runners.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

commonly.","created_at":"2024-03-29T10:37:25Z","updated_at":"2024-04-06T16:38:07Z","closed_at":"2024-03-31T14:49:25Z","merged_at":"2024-03-31T14:49:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"35d189993107c5b823042337e3b955568ae48593","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"uranusjr","id":605277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr","html_url":"https://github.com/uranusjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1937475224,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTM3NDc1MjI0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:API","name":"area:API","color":"efe07c","default":false,"description":"Airflow's

on selective checks, but also on the job executed, we choose whether to run job on public runners or self-hosted runners. So far the set of labels to select the runners were passed in a bit inconsistent way. Outputs of selective checks can only be strings and the `run-as` accepts array of strings (labels) - so we were using fromJSON to convert between the two. And we used runs-on inputs on a number of our workflows to pass the selection.\r\n\r\nHowever this meant that runs-on could be either string or array and that sometimes we passed public/self-hosted labels as strings directly and some of those were hard-coded.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes it consistently across the board to introduce consistent approach:\r\n\r\n* build info have no selective checks results yet, so for them runs-on is hardcoded\r\n* similarly for \"windows\" and release jobs that are manually run without running selective checks\r\n* selective checks will produce three outuputs - JSON stringiified array of labels:\r\n   * default (one that is selected depending on who runs the build)\r\n   * public (for cases where we want to force the builds to use public runners\r\n   * self-hosted (for cases where we want to force the builds to use self-hosted runners\r\n* all the outputs are named `<type>-runs-on-as-string` to make it clear they are all strings\r\n* all inputs of workflows expectings strings are named the same (with as-string suffix and <type> prefix)\r\n* whenever a job is run, we pass \"runs-on\" parameter to be `fromJSON` with appropriate type we want to use passed as input\r\n\r\nThis will make it easier to reason on which job is using which type of runner and it will make it easier in the future to make it more flexible when we add ASF self-hosted runners and possibly our own K8S runners, or when we would want to change labels for public runners or self-hosted runners.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

on selective checks, but also on the job executed, we choose whether to run job on public runners or self-hosted runners. So far the set of labels to select the runners were passed in a bit inconsistent way. Outputs of selective checks can only be strings and the `run-as` accepts array of strings (labels) - so we were using fromJSON to convert between the two. And we used runs-on inputs on a number of our workflows to pass the selection.\r\n\r\nHowever this meant that runs-on could be either string or array and that sometimes we passed public/self-hosted labels as strings directly and some of those were hard-coded.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes it consistently across the board to introduce consistent approach:\r\n\r\n* build info have no selective checks results yet, so for them runs-on is hardcoded\r\n* similarly for \"windows\" and release jobs that are manually run without running selective checks\r\n* selective checks will produce three outuputs - JSON stringiified array of labels:\r\n   * default (one that is selected depending on who runs the build)\r\n   * public (for cases where we want to force the builds to use public runners\r\n   * self-hosted (for cases where we want to force the builds to use self-hosted runners\r\n* all the outputs are named `<type>-runs-on-as-string` to make it clear they are all strings\r\n* all inputs of workflows expectings strings are named the same (with as-string suffix and <type> prefix)\r\n* whenever a job is run, we pass \"runs-on\" parameter to be `fromJSON` with appropriate type we want to use passed as input\r\n\r\nThis will make it easier to reason on which job is using which type of runner and it will make it easier in the future to make it more flexible when we add ASF self-hosted runners and possibly our own K8S runners, or when we would want to change labels for public runners or self-hosted runners.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

got rid of all of the old DAG pages and their buttons. But in the grid view, the tabs displayed depended on the task+run selection. It was then confusing as to where views disappeared to. Instead, let's show the DAG level, Run level and Task level  tabs. Therefore the more general tabs are always accessible on the page.\r\n\r\nAlso, moved the \"full screen\" expand button outside of Graph+Logs and it can be accessed at all times.\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/34489\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1314\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-28 at 3 37 53 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/4600967/c07d271e-f8cd-44ec-8782-b09253498959\">\r\n<img width=\"1327\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-28 at 3 37 41 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/4600967/27bed972-7b40-4487-b69b-fa004f9341e5\">\r\n<img width=\"1330\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-28 at 3 37 33 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/4600967/860c0966-b4a7-4f77-8e18-d2da81ebf413\">\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code changes, an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvement+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\nIn case of backwards incompatible changes please leave a note in a newsfragment file, named `{pr_number}.significant.rst` or `{issue_number}.significant.rst`, in [newsfragments](https://github.com/apache/airflow/tree/main/newsfragments).\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-28T19:39:51Z","updated_at":"2024-04-02T20:59:20Z","closed_at":"2024-04-02T15:52:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9d0ecb6cc566e05a5be408e029a311abc35dd152","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jscheffl","id":95105677,"node_id":"U_kgDOBasyjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95105677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl","html_url":"https://github.com/jscheffl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

we build PROD images in CI, we need constraints, to know which version of the depencies to use. Those constraints are build by earlier steps in the build and uploaded as artifacts so that they can be re-used by PROD image build. However depending on the type of PROD build (in main or in v2-*) different constraints are used: for main build we use source constraints because we are installing provider packages build from main sources, in v2* builds we are using PyPI constraints, because we are installing provider packages from PyPI. This made the dependency tree a bit complicated because PROD builds would have to wait for constraints generation rather than use quickly prepared source constraints and in #38533 we introduced an extra step in PROD build for v2* branches to additionally generate constraint in-the job that builds PROD images.\r\n\r\nThis however has some consequences, such as potentially incosistencies between constraints used during other parts of the build, because PROD images can be potentially built much later than the generated constraints for the rest of the build. Also it introduced the need for the PROD builds to pull CI images to generate the constraints which adds an overhead in the process and makes PROD builds in v2 branches few minutes longer than they could be.\r\n\r\nThis PR approaches it differently. Since now with `uv` constraints generation is way faster (few minutes, we could easily make PROD builds use always the same constraint artifacts generated in single job and pay a little delay penalty of starting the PROD builds but get it back at PROD build time (because constraints will be generated only once).\r\n\r\nAlso that removes (back) the need of PROD builds to pull the CI images and removes the need to generate source constraints at CI image build time - which will decrease the build time a little.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes necessary changes to make it happens:\r\n\r\n* removes source constraints generation in CI images\r\n* extracting generate-constraints job to be top-level job in CI.yml\r\n* add dependency from all PROD build to wait for generate-constraints\r\n* remove CI image pulling and related steps from PROD image build\r\n* switches PROD to download and use the full set of constraints generated by `generate-constraints` job\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

what's going on here is we need a TaskInstance object instead of a Row object when sending over the wire in RPC call.  But the full story on this one is actually somewhat complicated.\r\nIt was back in 2.2.0 in #25312 when we converted to query with the column attrs instead of the TI object (#28900 only refactored this logic into a function).  The reason was to avoid locking the dag_run table since TI newly had a dag_run relationship attr.  Now, this causes a problem with AIP-44 because the RPC api does not know how to serialize a Row object.\r\nThis PR switches back to querying a TaskInstance object, but avoids locking dag_run by using lazy_load option.  Meanwhile, since try_number is a horrible attribute (which gives you a different answer depending on the state), we have to switch it back to look at the underlying private attr instead of the public accesor.\r\n\r\n\r\nOlder description:\r\n~This was originally added in #28900 presumably for compatiblity with serialization.  Maybe things have changed since then, because it's actually the Row object that does not serialize properly (and this is what's returned with this option True) meanwhile the TaskInstance object actually is serialized properly.  This is the only usage of this param, and it's not needed here, so I'm just removing it.

taking yet another approach with this.\r\n\r\nIt turns out there was a non-obvious 4th usage of session in this function, so I went back to trying to make it an RPC call.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, we don't have a TaskPydantic model, and when you serialize an operator object it doesn't really do it properly because it doesn't \"encode\" it i.e. it doesn't add the TYPE var so the receiver has no idea what the object is.  This, I assume, is because historically an operator was always only serialized as part of another object.\r\n\r\nWhat I did to \"fix\" this is I make base serialization serialize operator objects \"properly\", i.e. running through `_encode`.\r\n\r\nThis necessitated a change to the way SerDag deserializes its tasks.\r\n\r\nThe other wonky thing here is that we expect (somewhere in the execution process) the task object on a TI to also have a dag, which, happens to get lost in serialization (and yeah, would be a bit reduntant perhaps to include that when serializing DAG for example... think the DAG ser'd on each task....), so what I do is add it back after the TI comes back through the RPC....  It's a bit of a mess but that's kind of where we're at.\r\n\r\nPlease give it a look when you can @uranusjr @potiuk and let me know what you think of the approach.  I suspect there will be a test failure or two that I have to correct with this change.\r\n\r\nOrig:\r\n~The only usages of the provided session in this function are calls to other funcs which are also decorated with provide_session, and which are already RPC calls. There does not seem to be a reason that they all need to be in the same session.  So we should be able to simply remove this decorator, thus making this function AIP-44 compatible.~\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-27T21:53:38Z","updated_at":"2024-08-09T06:10:22Z","closed_at":"2024-04-09T23:34:03Z","merged_at":"2024-04-09T23:34:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"0af5d923d99591576b3758ab3c694d02dbe152bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"hussein-awala","id":21311487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzExNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21311487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala","html_url":"https://github.com/hussein-awala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eladkal","id":45845474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODQ1NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45845474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal","html_url":"https://github.com/eladkal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEx
