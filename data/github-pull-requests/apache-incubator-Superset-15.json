SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR adds some configuration options for the docker-compose setup:\r\n\r\n1. Enable using a password when connecting to redis\r\n2. Enable using redis as the results backend\r\n\r\nThese changes are useful in scenarios where we want to use the docker-compose setup together with an existing redis instance and when we potentially want to run the superset UI on a different node from the superset workers without going all the way to using the k8s setup.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nFor testing the redis password support, apply the following patch:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/docker-compose-image-tag.yml b/docker-compose-image-tag.yml\r\nindex 9309c6d619..b8c5aad55d 100644\r\n---

docker-compose-image-tag.yml up` and verify that Redis operations work.\r\n\r\nFor testing the redis results backend support, toggle the feature via `echo RESULTS_BACKEND_CACHE_TYPE=RedisCache > docker/.env-local`, restart the stack, and verify that Redis operations work.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n-

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the docker-compose setup to enable customizing the password used for the admin user. This is useful in scenarios where we want to use the docker-compose setup to spin up a self-contained superset instance but when we don't want to risk someone being able to log in as an admin with the known default credentials.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Configure password override: `echo 'ADMIN_PASSWORD=supersecret' > docker/.env-local`\r\n2. Run the stack: `TAG=4.0.2 docker compose -f docker-compose-image-tag.yml up`\r\n3. Go to http://localhost:8088 and log in using username admin and the password from step 1\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime

SUMMARY\r\nIt's possible to override the content for the Homepage through the `extensionRegistry` (available options include `welcome.banner`, `welcome.main.replacement` and

Summary\r\nPeriodically we need to run this script to rebuild the list of translatable strings from static analysis of the code base.\r\n\r\nAlso adding `--no-location` to `pybabel extract` fixing merge conflicts issues we've been having around these .po files. \r\n\r\nAlso fixing the docs builds, they've been broken.\r\n\r\n~~About the fact that merge conflicts are really tricky around translation work in general, I was thinking it may be doable to write a simple utility that would strip all comments from po files, as they are just comments referencing where the msgid exists, and operate at that level if/when needed. Like you hit a merge conflict, strip both files from comment, diff them, and commit without comments. I think the next pybabel script run would bring back the comments.~~\r\n\r\n~~Maybe we even want to pass a flag to pybabel to compeltely avoid adding source references as comments. We'd loose the ability to easily find where the string lives in the codebase, but for that you can just `git grep`.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen Superset triggers OAuth2 it needs to pass to the OAuth provider a redirect URL, to where the user will be sent with the initial OAuth2 code after granting access to Superset. This redirect URL is built using `url_for`, and needs to run in a Flask request context in order to have access to the application `SERVER_NAME`, in addition to `PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME` and `APPLICATION_ROOT`.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the `get_sql_results` Celery task to run the query under a dummy request context. This is enough for Superset to compute the redirect URL when the database is configured to run in async mode.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-07-02 at 19-26-15 Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1534870/26c94c2c-7bf6-4ae7-abac-f3325ba5bbb2)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-07-02 at 19-24-43 Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1534870/f073e955-5298-4e79-a053-b29cbb1496c8)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds support for specifying a list of columns to be used in the `select_columns` parameter with the `getUserOwnedObjects` helper. \r\n\r\nIt also splits the `getRecentActivityObjs` so that the logic to fetch dashboards and charts is handled by a separate helper: `getFilteredChartsandDashboards`. This new helper also supports specifying values for the `select_columns` parameters (both for the chart and dashboard requests).\r\n\r\nThese parameters are all optional, so it shouldn't impact any existing call/implementation. Please refer to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28609 for additional context on the `select_columns` parameter.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo UI changes.\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nThe filter option \"Select first filter value by default\" is generally used when users want the dashboard to load with initial filters set. This is important when charts have a lot of data or they don't make sense without an initial filter. This PR fixes a bug were the dashboard could not leave the loading state when these initial filters could not be loaded. Now it will correctly display a message to the user informing which filters are failing and preventing the dashboard from rendering.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<img

filter value by default\" option checked\r\n2 - Simulate a failure when loading the filter\r\n3 - Check that the dashboard presents a message indicating which filter is preventing the dashboard from rendering\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nFollow up PR after #28444.\r\nThe only notable change after that PR is that I shortened the parameter names to properly reflect the usage and to fit within the 30 character limit. This name change also inverts the meaning of the parameter and thus the usage has also been inverted everywhere.\r\n\r\nFixes issue #28443 \r\nRenamed `db_engine_specs` parameter `allows_alias_to_source_column` to `order_by_require_unique_alias` and added the new parameter `group_by_require_unique_alias`. This new name also inverts the meaning of the parameter, but properly reflects its function.\r\n\r\nThe previous parameter is used to tell the SQLA generator to rename aliases used in `ORDER BY` statements with aggregations, to ensure that the source column is referenced. Some engines (e.g. Drill) needs to be able to do the same thing for aliases in `GROUP BY` statements.\r\n\r\nThe new parameter is used to tell the SQLA generator to rename any alias of a source column that is used in an aggregation in a `GROUP BY` statement, to ensure that the source column is referenced.\r\n\r\nFor example this query\r\n```\r\nSELECT length(n_name) AS n_name\r\n...\r\nGROUP BY length(n_name)\r\n```\r\nbecomes\r\n```\r\nSELECT length(n_name) AS n_name__\r\n...\r\nGROUP BY length(n_name)\r\n``` \r\nThis ensures that the source column `n_name` is used in the `length(n_name)` statement.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-07-02 16-20-05](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/14278584/a14b290a-c565-4b6b-9a1f-c9b666045476)\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-07-02 15-48-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/14278584/86786cae-9e51-442e-9bc7-54503568be4a)\r\n\r\nThe documentation of the new `group_by_require_unique_alias` parameter has been added, and errors in the documentation of `order_by_require_unique_alias`/(previously)`allows_alias_to_source_column` has been fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. Start Superset\r\n2. Navigate to the Superset web application and login\r\n3. Connect to a Drill database\r\n4. Create a dataset of the Drill database\r\n5. Create a chart from that dataset\r\n6. Select visualization type Table with query mode Aggregate\r\n7. Add two columns in the dimensions\r\n8. Aggregate the data of one of the columns (e.g. length(column_a))\r\n9. Press \"view query\"\r\n10. The query should now contain a GROUP BY statement of an aggregation, and the alias of that aggregation should have \"__\" at the end of the name.\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nSELECT length(n_name) AS n_name__\r\n...\r\nGROUP BY length(n_name)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

SUMMARY\r\nThe recent PR #29344 caused a regression causing importing of the Metastore cache outside the app context to fail.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n**Problem:**  \r\nWhen embedding the dashboard, the filter panel does not hide even when `show_filters` is set to `false`.\r\nAfter a quick investigation, I found that this parameter is not being handled at all.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**  \r\n- By default, the filter panel will be shown.\r\n- The filter panel should be hidden if the `show_filters` parameter is explicitly set to `false` or `0`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!---

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nAdd 3 Customization Options for echarts data zoom:\r\n- start: The end percentage of the window out of the data extent, in the range of 0 ~ 100.\r\n- end: The end percentage of the window out of the data extent, in the range of 0 ~ 100.\r\n- zoomLock: Specify whether to lock the size of window (selected area).\r\n\r\nCurrently, when Data Zoom is enabled in ECharts, the default start and end values are set to 0 and 100, respectively, which means all data is displayed in a single chart by default. This may not be ideal for high-density data scenarios.\r\n\r\nBy introducing these customization options, users can set the **default data range** for data zooming. This can be particularly beneficial for users with high-density data, allowing them to control the default size of the sliding window more effectively. \r\n\r\nFor example, users can set start to 0 and end to 10, which will display the top 10% of the data by default. \r\nUsers can still navigate through the rest of the data range by dragging the data zoom bar.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"1316\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/157834442/102f2277-4e5a-4c75-bf56-a4c06b640356\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"1692\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/157834442/d44fe948-5f5b-4042-883d-060fd81ae3b1\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28570 updated `SelectTagsValue` and `tagToSelectOption`. These were also used by the Tags filter in the CRUD views (dashboards, charts and saved queries), so these filters stopped working (as they're now configured to use the `tag.id` as the value (rather than the `tag.name` which is expected by the API filter).\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new filter operator for these assets to be able to filter tags by ID. I decided not to update the existing filter (that filters by name) and instead create a new one, to avoid a breaking change in the API.\r\n\r\nI also removed the `TAGGING_SYSTEM` FF check in the `SavedQueries` API, for consistency with the `Dashboard` (https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23909) and `Chart` (https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24060) APIs.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

The Flask-AppBuilder `get_session` method is a property and thus `get_session()` actually unnecessarily instantiates a new session.\r\n2. There's a pattern of over committing. Note that the Flask-AppBuilder [`add_permission_view_menu`](https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/blob/bbf2adb1312ac1f994ef04e5d5e581d1447cb732/flask_appbuilder/security/sqla/manager.py#L610-L635) function commits (which is called by `merge_pv`) and thus there's no need to re-commit.\r\n\r\nNote many of the existing commits could likely be also removed as we have a tendency of over commiting. I'm hoping to tackle that as part of SIP-99B by way of transactions.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nI have checked and fixed Russian translations for the components of the chart editor that are related to up-to-date charts. These are the ones affected:\r\n\r\n- Area Chart\r\n- Big Number\r\n- Big Number with Trendline\r\n- Box Plot\r\n- Bubble Chart\r\n- Funnel Chart\r\n- Gauge Chart\r\n- Generic Chart\r\n- Graph Chart\r\n- Handlebars\r\n- Heatmap\r\n- Histogram\r\n- Line Chart\r\n- Mixed Chart\r\n- Nightingale Rose Chart\r\n- Pie Chart\r\n- Pivot Table\r\n- Radar Chart\r\n- Sunburst\r\n- Table\r\n- Tree Chart\r\n- Treemap\r\n- Waterfall Chart\r\n- Word Cloud\r\n\r\nAny charts that were marked as Legacy or Deprecated were left out of scope.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I have noticed that #28637 introduced \"Current\" option to dashboard filters. So I have extracted new strings and translated them as well. This is the reason why other i18n files are affected.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nI've been fighting with inconsistencies between running CI locally and remote. Whilst working on a specific PR the Celery tests would always succeed locally whereas they would fail in a remote setting. The errors were always suppressed, but my hunch was that maybe the Celery worker(s) weren't responsive as queries remained in the pending state.\r\n\r\nIf I mangled the `python_tests.sh` script to only run the `tests/integration_tests/celery_tests.py` tests everything seemed to be fine which indicated that maybe there was a temporal facet to the flakiness of the tests. Reading through the GitHub actions/workflows it seems like we manually background the task (via the `&`) yet one can actually run Celery in a detached state, which seems more robust.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.

Per [the documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/how-to/fixtures.html#use-fixtures-in-classes-and-modules-with-usefixtures) it seems like fixtures are only invoked at the class or test

SUMMARY\r\nWhen the x-axis was changed back to a time item from a non-time control item, the values of hidden fields were not properly restored to their original state, causing them to be consistently recognized as hidden items and preventing form_data from being sent.\r\nThis commit fixes the issue and includes test code to prevent regression.\r\n\r\nFixes #29331 \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR reverts https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27883 which incorrectly calculated the chart's padding and introduced https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/29342.\r\n\r\nThere's a [bug](https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/20068) with `yAxis.inverse` in ECharts and we don't know when a fix will be provided. To fix this issue, this PR partially reverts https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23273 which introduced said configuration. I'm purposefully not adding a migration to this PR, as https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23273 did, so it can be cherry-picked as it's affecting all 4.0.x versions. This will change the default y-axis order of horizontal bar charts. @yousoph \r\n\r\nAn alternative solution, would be to fix the ECharts bug. @villebro \r\n\r\nFixes

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR converts the Key Value commands to a DAO, which gives the caller much more control over when commits/rollbacks happen, and what to do about expired entries. Other changes:\r\n- Update all code that uses the KV commands to use the new DAO, making sure flushes/commits happen outside the DAO. In particular, this covers the following major components:\r\n  - Explore permalinks\r\n  - Dashboard permalinks\r\n  - Distributed lock. During the refactor, the distributed lock was moved under a module of its own + break out the stateful logic into commands that use the new DAO.\r\n  - Metastore cache. I considered breaking out the logic into commands, but it felt more sensible to keep the code as-is under a single python file, as it's under `extensions`. In addition, this doesn't use the new `transaction` decorator, as we need to adhere to the `Flask-Caching` API.\r\n- The old KV command integration tests are converted into functionally equivalent unit tests\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nSome of our account managers send their reports in CSV format. Currently, the index is shown in the CSV due to the `POST_PROCESSED` value being set in the call to the API. This is causing a few complaints from our clients due to the need for them to remove the column when working with the report data.\r\n\r\nThere is a current PR that has been ongoing for over a year and appears to have stalled. I have linked this below. Since this is unlikely to be completed, I am opening this in the hopes that we can resolve it sooner. As opposed to their approach, I reformat the `url` used to call the API based on the `CSV_INDEX`, leaving it as-is for its default behaviour.\r\n\r\nIssue #[22981](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/22981) \r\n[Current PR](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23155)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n![Superset Index](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/18397189/faf75d54-866a-4f4f-8f1d-d9449516a9bc)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nStarting over after a change of plan. Changing title and summary for the PR.\r\n\r\nIn this PR:\r\n- centralizing views/app error handling in `superset/views/error_handling.py`\r\n- moving app referencing outside of module scope an into a function that `superset/initialization` can call\r\n- altering imports \r\n- merging `json_errors_response` into `json_error_response` with a bit of polymorphy so it can receive different types as its first param\r\n- minimal refactoring outside of this, mostly just centralizing the views error handling functions into a separate module\r\n\r\nFuture / potential follow ups:\r\n- refactor further, cleaning up code, DRYing further \r\n- making sure all errors are covered\r\n- look back at error-handling-related SIPs https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9298 and SIP-40 for next steps\r\n\r\n~~I've recently encountered some errors on the dashboard page, within Chart widgets where html is displayed as a result of calling the `api/chart/data` endpoint, and presumably while hitting some 502 / 504s-type error. The error is hard to reproduce, but I'm thinking the approach bellow should improve / prevent that endpoint from ever returning html.~~\r\n\r\n~~Two changes here: sprinkling the @handle_api_error decorator in critical related views improving the 500 flask error handler to be a bit smarter, hoping it'll catch some of the problems and return json when expecting it~~\r\n\r\n##

to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/29321, where that PR goes broad and also handles proxies/load-balancer/nginx or something else returning an unexpected
