What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR backports https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13619.\n\nThe original test added in branch-2.0 was failed in branch-1.6.\n\nThis seems because the behaviour was changed in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/101663f1ae222a919fc40510aa4f2bad22d1be6f. This was failure while calculating Euler's number which ends up with a infinity regardless of this path.\n\nSo, I brought the dataset from `AFTSurvivalRegressionExample` to make sure this is working and then wrote the test.\n\nI ran the test before/after creating empty partitions. `model.scale` becomes `1.0` with empty partitions and becames `1.547` without them.\n\nAfter this patch, this becomes always `1.547`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`UTF8String` and all `Unsafe*` classes are backed by either on-heap or off-heap byte arrays. The code generated version `SortMergeJoin` buffers the left hand side join keys during iteration. This was actually problematic in off-heap mode when one of the keys is a `UTF8String` (or any other 'Unsafe*` object) and the left hand side iterator was exhausted (and released its memory); the buffered keys would reference freed memory. This causes Seg-faults and all kinds of other undefined behavior when we would use one these buffered keys.\n\nThis PR fixes this problem by creating copies of the buffered variables. I have added a general method to the `CodeGenerator` for this. I have checked all places in which this could happen, and only `SortMergeJoin` had this problem.\n\nThis PR is largely based on the work of @robbinspg and he should be credited for this.\n\ncloses https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13707\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually tested on problematic workloads.\n","created_at":"2016-06-17T00:42:45Z","updated_at":"2016-06-17T05:29:11Z","closed_at":"2016-06-17T05:29:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6d7dddef66d90f3fe4662153ccb3ca0dd2572f88","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13723/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13723/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13723/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5c33eac8139bcca81a59327cd30d3eac89310bb9","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-15822-2","ref":"SPARK-15822-2","sha":"5c33eac8139bcca81a59327cd30d3eac89310bb9","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`HIVE_METASTORE_PARTITION_PRUNING` is a public `SQLConf`. When `true`, some predicates will be pushed down into the Hive metastore so that unmatching partitions can be eliminated earlier. The current default value is `false`. For performance improvement, users might turn this parameter on.\n\nSo far, the code base does not have such a test case to verify whether this `SQLConf` properly works. This PR is to improve the test case coverage for avoiding future regression.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nN/A\n","created_at":"2016-06-16T18:42:28Z","updated_at":"2016-06-16T21:24:55Z","closed_at":"2016-06-16T21:24:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3ac76a42dc5ce0b133532a3dd02e64eb8fc073b9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13716/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13716/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13716/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1d41162e2e5cca471f12978eac9e69d4a66f40ae","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:addTestMetastorePartitionPruning","ref":"addTestMetastorePartitionPruning","sha":"1d41162e2e5cca471f12978eac9e69d4a66f40ae","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nYarn supports rolling log aggregation since 2.6, previously log will only be aggregated to HDFS after application is finished, it is quite painful for long running applications like Spark Streaming, thriftserver. Also out of disk problem will be occurred when log file is too large. So here propose to add support of rolling log aggregation for Spark on yarn.\n\nOne limitation for this is that log4j should be set to change to file appender, now in Spark itself uses console appender by default, in which file will not be created again once removed after aggregation. But I think lots of production users should have changed their log4j configuration instead of default on, so this is not a big problem.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually verified with Hadoop

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch adds pagination support for the Stage Tables in the Stage tab. Pagination is provided for all of the four Job Tables (active, pending, completed, and failed). Besides, the paged stage tables are also used in JobPage (the detail page for one job) and PoolPage.\n\nInteractions (jumping, sorting, and setting page size) for paged tables are also included.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested manually by using checking the Web UI after completing and failing hundreds of jobs.  Same as the testings for [Paginate Job Table in Jobs tab](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13620).\n\nThis shows the pagination for completed stages:\n![paged stage

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch adds support for writing in `csv` format in Structured Streaming:\n\n**1. At a high level, this patch forms the following class hierarchy**:\n\n```\n                            <OutputWriter>\n                                  ↑\n                         CSVOutputWriterBase\n                             ↗          ↖\n(anonymous batch) CSVOutputWriter    (anonymous streaming) CSVOutputWriter\n                                           [write data without using\n                                              an OutputCommitter]\n```\n\n```\n                         <OutputWriterFactory>\n                             ↗          ↖\n       BatchCSVOutputWriterFactory   StreamingCSVOutputWriterFactory\n```\n\nThe streaming CSVOutputWriter would write data **without** using an `OutputCommitter`, which was the same approach taken by [SPARK-14716](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12409).\n\n**2. To support compression, this patch attaches an extension to the path assigned by `FileStreamSink`**.\n\nE.g., if we write out using the `gzip` compression and `FileStreamSink` assigns path `${uuid}` to the output writer, then in the end the file written out will be `${uuid}.csv.gz`. This way when we read the file back, we should be able to interpret it correctly as `gzip` compressed.\n\nThis is slightly different from [SPARK-14716](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12409).\n##

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR eliminates redundant cast from an `ArrayType` with `containsNull = false` or a `MapType` with `containsNull = false`.\n\nFor example, in `ArrayType` case, current implementation leaves a cast `cast(value#63 as array<double>).toDoubleArray`. However, we can eliminate `cast(value#63 as array<double>)` if we know `value#63` does not include `null`. This PR apply this elimination for `ArrayType` and `MapType` in `SimplifyCasts` at a plan optimization phase.\n\nIn summary, we got 1.2-1.3x performance improvements over the code before applying this PR.\nHere are performance results of benchmark programs:\n\n```\n  test(\"Read array in Dataset\") {\n    import sparkSession.implicits._\n\n    val iters = 5\n    val n = 1024 * 1024\n    val rows =

Array.tabulate(n)(i => i)).toDS()\n    intDS.count() // force to create ds\n    val lastElement = n - 1\n    val randElement = rand.nextInt(lastElement)\n\n    benchmark.addCase(s\"Read int array in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis pr adds `PushPredicateThroughObjectConsumer` rule to push-down predicates through `ObjectConsumer`.\nAnd as an example, I implemented push-down typed filter through `SerializeFromObject`.\n\nThe optimized plan for the following `DataFrame`:\n\n```\nSeq((\"a\", 1), (\"b\", 2), (\"c\", 3)).toDS().map(v => (v._1, v._2 + 1)).filter(_._1 == \"b\")\n```\n\nwas before patch:\n\n```\nFilter <function1>.apply\n+- SerializeFromObject [staticinvoke(class org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String, StringType, fromString, assertnotnull(input[0, scala.Tuple2, true], top level non-flat input object)._1, true) AS _1#449, assertnotnull(input[0, scala.Tuple2, true], top level non-flat input object)._2 AS _2#450]\n   +- MapElements <function1>, obj#448: scala.Tuple2\n      +- DeserializeToObject newInstance(class scala.Tuple2), obj#447: scala.Tuple2\n         +- LocalRelation [_1#442, _2#443]\n```\n\nbecomes after patch:\n\n```\nSerializeFromObject [staticinvoke(class org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String, StringType, fromString, assertnotnull(input[0, scala.Tuple2, true], top level non-flat input object)._1, true) AS _1#449, assertnotnull(input[0, scala.Tuple2, true], top level non-flat input object)._2 AS _2#450]\n+- Filter <function1>.apply\n   +- MapElements <function1>, obj#448: scala.Tuple2\n      +- DeserializeToObject newInstance(class scala.Tuple2), obj#447: scala.Tuple2\n         +- LocalRelation [_1#442, _2#443]\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded tests to check if push-down typed filter through `SerializeFromObject` correctly works.\n","created_at":"2016-06-16T04:57:20Z","updated_at":"2016-06-24T09:19:38Z","closed_at":"2016-06-24T09:19:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f7497c8bd52a2682a66ec2def0f64d74ea536e19","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13702/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13702/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13702/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/75805a491dca1c4f8b03bae43449c56fc31a5584","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-15980","ref":"issues/SPARK-15980","sha":"75805a491dca1c4f8b03bae43449c56fc31a5584","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe base class `SpecificParquetRecordReaderBase` used for vectorized parquet reader will try to get pushed-down filters from the given configuration. This pushed-down filters are used for RowGroups-level filtering. However, we don't set up the filters to push down into the configuration. In other words, the filters are not actually pushed down to do RowGroups-level filtering. This patch is to fix this and tries to set up the filters for pushing down to configuration for the reader.\n\nThe benchmark that excludes the time of writing Parquet file:\n\n```\ntest(\"Benchmark for Parquet\") {\n  val N = 500 << 12\n    withParquetTable((0 until N).map(i => (101, i)), \"t\") {\n      val benchmark = new Benchmark(\"Parquet reader\", N)\n      benchmark.addCase(\"reading Parquet file\", 10) { iter =>\n        sql(\"SELECT _1 FROM t where t._1 < 100\").collect()\n      }\n      benchmark.run()\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`withParquetTable` in default will run tests for vectorized reader non-vectorized readers. I only let it run vectorized reader.\n\nWhen we set the block size of parquet as 1024 to have multiple row groups. The benchmark is:\n\nBefore this patch:\n\nThe retrieved row groups: 8063\n\n```\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_71-b15 on Linux 3.19.0-25-generic\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-5557U CPU @ 3.10GHz\nParquet reader:                          Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nreading Parquet file                           825 / 1233          2.5         402.6       1.0X\n```\n\nAfter this patch:\n\nThe retrieved row groups: 0\n\n```\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_71-b15 on Linux 3.19.0-25-generic\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-5557U CPU @ 3.10GHz\nParquet reader:                          Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nreading Parquet file                           306 /  503          6.7         149.6       1.0X\n```\n\nNext, I run the benchmark for non-pushdown case using the same benchmark code but with disabled pushdown configuration. This time the parquet block size is default value.\n\nBefore this patch:\n\n```\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_71-b15 on Linux 3.19.0-25-generic\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-5557U CPU @ 3.10GHz\nParquet reader:                          Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nreading Parquet file                           136 /  238         15.0          66.5       1.0X\n```\n\nAfter this patch:\n\n```\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_71-b15 on Linux 3.19.0-25-generic\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-5557U CPU @ 3.10GHz\nParquet reader:                          Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nreading Parquet file                           124 /  193         16.5          60.7       1.0X\n```\n\nFor non-pushdown case, from the results, I think this patch doesn't affect normal code path.\n\nI've manually output the `totalRowCount` in `SpecificParquetRecordReaderBase` to see if this patch actually filter the row-groups. When running the above benchmark:\n\nAfter this patch:\n    `totalRowCount = 0`\n\nBefore this patch:\n    `totalRowCount = 1024000`\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests should be passed.\n","created_at":"2016-06-16T04:00:08Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:19:50Z","closed_at":"2016-08-10T17:55:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"983bcdd0d5f063d8631bfc5d6d8c1f74e656dbd6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13701/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13701/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13701/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ca074f11cb51f792c603dcdf3c07502525b9d134","head":{"label":"viirya:vectorized-reader-push-down-filter2","ref":"vectorized-reader-push-down-filter2","sha":"ca074f11cb51f792c603dcdf3c07502525b9d134","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch renames various Parquet support classes from CatalystAbc to ParquetAbc. This new naming makes more sense for two reasons:\n1. These are not optimizer related (i.e. Catalyst) classes.\n2. We are in the Spark code base, and as a result it'd be more clear to call out these are Parquet support classes, rather than some Spark classes.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRenamed test cases as well.\n","created_at":"2016-06-16T03:25:42Z","updated_at":"2016-06-16T07:21:12Z","closed_at":"2016-06-16T07:21:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"966d7f2e5817db672191a5a27a6b3956cd6a9444","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13700/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13700/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13700/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/036662bcab458039d4c37009cf9dd040c45e090c","head":{"label":"rxin:parquet-rename-branch-2.0","ref":"parquet-rename-branch-2.0","sha":"036662bcab458039d4c37009cf9dd040c45e090c","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently the initial buffer size in the sorter is hard coded inside the code and is too small for large workload. As a result, the sorter spends significant time expanding the buffer size and copying the data. It would be useful to have it configurable.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested by running a job on the cluster.\n","created_at":"2016-06-16T01:36:11Z","updated_at":"2016-06-25T08:15:26Z","closed_at":"2016-06-25T08:15:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"81af4461782a4fa40202d4ee7882f0ff6567012c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13699/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13699/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13699/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cf464a3eae5d2fa86f4946c302b15df9d9ee1a21","head":{"label":"sitalkedia:config_sort_buffer_upstream","ref":"config_sort_buffer_upstream","sha":"cf464a3eae5d2fa86f4946c302b15df9d9ee1a21","user":{"login":"sitalkedia","id":11507549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTA3NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11507549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia","html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51496876,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTQ5Njg3Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"sitalkedia/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sitalkedia","id":11507549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTA3NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11507549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia","html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nInterface method `FileFormat.prepareRead()` was added in #12088 to handle a special case in the LibSVM data source.\n\nHowever, the semantics of this interface method isn't intuitive: it returns a modified version of the data source options map. Considering that the LibSVM case can be easily handled using schema metadata inside `inferSchema`, we can remove this interface method to keep the `FileFormat` interface clean.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch renames various Parquet support classes from CatalystAbc to ParquetAbc. This new naming makes more sense for two reasons:\n1. These are not optimizer related (i.e. Catalyst) classes.\n2. We are in the Spark code base, and as a result it'd be more clear to call out these are Parquet support classes, rather than some Spark classes.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRenamed test cases as well.\n","created_at":"2016-06-15T23:20:05Z","updated_at":"2016-06-16T03:26:30Z","closed_at":"2016-06-16T03:07:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a945a30b03a9b5697202bc79dbb199891908ee8e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13696/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13696/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13696/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/61a56c2d7776f4b4ab91346b930910ee3686ae0b","head":{"label":"rxin:parquet-rename","ref":"parquet-rename","sha":"61a56c2d7776f4b4ab91346b930910ee3686ae0b","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nI've found some minor issues in \"show tables\" command:\n1. In the `SessionCatalog.scala`, `listTables(db: String)` method will call `listTables(formatDatabaseName(db), \"*\")` to list all the tables for certain db, but in the method `listTables(db: String, pattern: String)`, this db name is formatted once more. So I think we should remove \n   `formatDatabaseName()` in the caller.\n2. I suggest to add sort to listTables(db: String) in InMemoryCatalog.scala, just like listDatabases().\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThe existing test cases should cover it.\n","created_at":"2016-06-15T23:07:08Z","updated_at":"2016-06-16T21:58:30Z","closed_at":"2016-06-16T21:19:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e7749e53300a510adca698797a200e33c3bb1a58","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13695/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13695/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13695/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2bbc919105e20a9c766f156e80fad18052395215","head":{"label":"bomeng:SPARK-15978","ref":"SPARK-15978","sha":"2bbc919105e20a9c766f156e80fad18052395215","user":{"login":"bomeng","id":295781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTc4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/295781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng","html_url":"https://github.com/bomeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"6e0b3d795c572a9df589e148c0e55e4eeba7946c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe way bash script `build/spark-build-info` is called from core/pom.xml prevents Spark building on Windows. Instead of calling the script directly we call bash and pass the script as an argument. This enables running it on Windows with bash installed which typically comes with Git.\n\nThis brings https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13612 up-to-date and also addresses comments from the code review.\n\nCloses #13612\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI built manually (on a Mac) to verify it didn't break Mac compilation.\n","created_at":"2016-06-15T21:24:24Z","updated_at":"2016-06-16T21:24:14Z","closed_at":"2016-06-16T03:13:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dc4d59bd92e6923e0e4864f9120636f889bb4983","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13691/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13691/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13691/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b1b1b9ad05a56a4e5c8fcf409a079ee338fde2de","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-15851","ref":"SPARK-15851","sha":"b1b1b9ad05a56a4e5c8fcf409a079ee338fde2de","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nImplement a wrapper in SparkR to support decision tree regression. R's naive Decision Tree Regression implementation is from package rpart with signature `rpart(formula, dataframe, method=\"anova\")`. I propose we could implement API like `spark.rpart(dataframe, formula, ...)` . After having implemented decision tree classification, we could refactor this two into an API more like `rpart()`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTest with unit test in SparkR\n","created_at":"2016-06-15T20:44:41Z","updated_at":"2017-02-03T11:26:06Z","closed_at":"2017-02-03T11:26:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3a2340cbab54e98e2e7469359ddad9e2caabc685","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13690/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13690/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13690/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0694f84e86a18179f06abf028d6e573c5c1af4b0","head":{"label":"vectorijk:DEV-DTRegression","ref":"DEV-DTRegression","sha":"0694f84e86a18179f06abf028d6e573c5c1af4b0","user":{"login":"vectorijk","id":3419881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTk4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3419881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vectorijk","html_url":"https://github.com/vectorijk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vectorijk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vectorijk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vectorijk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vectorijk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vectorijk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vectorijk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vectorijk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vectorijk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vectorijk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":43246256,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MzI0NjI1Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"vectorijk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vectorijk","id":3419881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTk4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3419881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vectorijk","html_url":"https://github.com/vectorijk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vectorijk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vectorijk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vectorijk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vectorijk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vectorijk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vectorijk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vectorijk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vectorijk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vectorijk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vectorijk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSPARK-15927 exacerbated a race in BasicSchedulerIntegrationTest, so it went from very unlikely to fairly frequent.  The issue is that stage numbering is not completely deterministic, but these tests treated it like it was.  So turn off the tests.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\non my laptop the test failed abotu 10% of the time before this change, and didn't fail in 500 runs after the change.\n","created_at":"2016-06-15T19:28:51Z","updated_at":"2016-06-27T21:58:43Z","closed_at":"2016-06-15T21:46:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0b235d1d319dc822370d496f82d05514967e343a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13688/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13688/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13688/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3ae2a5f2f437488a986f279066c4bda219946d49","head":{"label":"squito:hotfix_basic_scheduler","ref":"hotfix_basic_scheduler","sha":"3ae2a5f2f437488a986f279066c4bda219946d49","user":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29212749,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTIxMjc0OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"squito/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/squito/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe `getCached` method of `HiveMetastoreCatalog` computes `pathsInMetastore` from the metastore relation's catalog table. This only returns the table base path, which is not correct for partitioned\ntables. As a result, cached lookups on partitioned tables always miss, and these relations are always recomputed.\n\nRather than get `pathsInMetastore` from\n\n```\nmetastoreRelation.catalogTable.storage.locationUri.toSeq\n```\n\nI modified the `getCached` method to take a `pathsInMetastore` argument. Calls to this method pass in the paths computed from calls to the Hive metastore. This is how `getCached` was implemented in Spark 1.5:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e0c3212a9b42e3e704b070da4ac25b68c584427f/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/HiveMetastoreCatalog.scala#L444.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI tested by (temporarily) adding logging to the `getCached` method and ran `spark.table(\"...\")` on a partitioned table in a spark-shell before and after this patch. Before this patch, the value of `useCached` in `getCached` was `false`. After the patch it was `true`. I also validated that caching still works for unpartitioned tables.\n","created_at":"2016-06-15T17:17:34Z","updated_at":"2016-06-15T22:56:23Z","closed_at":"2016-06-15T19:13:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6819b79baccc7a41e8881c8b63c1f5f5ce046911","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13686/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13686/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13686/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/60bfe10e350d245632e940aa758cec4f0d2c4006","head":{"label":"VideoAmp:spark-15968","ref":"spark-15968","sha":"60bfe10e350d245632e940aa758cec4f0d2c4006","user":{"login":"VideoAmp","id":7621972,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjE5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7621972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp","html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49447912,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTQ0NzkxMg==","name":"spark-public","full_name":"VideoAmp/spark-public","private":false,"owner":{"login":"VideoAmp","id":7621972,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjE5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7621972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp","html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp/spark-public","description":"Mirror

The problem\n\nBefore this change, if either of the following cases happened to a task , the task would be marked as `FAILED` instead of `KILLED`:\n- the task was killed before it was deserialized\n- `executor.kill()` marked `taskRunner.killed`, but before calling `task.killed()` the worker thread threw the `TaskKilledException`\n\nThe reason is, in the `catch` block of the current [Executor.TaskRunner](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/executor/Executor.scala#L362)'s implementation, we are mistakenly catching:\n\n``` scala\ncase _: TaskKilledException | _: InterruptedException if task.killed => ...\n```\n\nthe semantics of which is:\n- **(**`TaskKilledException` **OR** `InterruptedException`**)** **AND** `task.killed`\n\nThen when `TaskKilledException` is thrown but `task.killed` is not marked, we would mark the task as `FAILED` (which should really be `KILLED`).\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch alters the catch condition's semantics from:\n- **(**`TaskKilledException` **OR** `InterruptedException`**)** **AND** `task.killed`\n\nto\n- `TaskKilledException` **OR** **(**`InterruptedException` **AND** `task.killed`**)**\n\nso that we can catch `TaskKilledException` correctly and mark the task as `KILLED` correctly.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded unit test which failed before the change, ran new test 1000 times

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSince we are probably going to add more statistics related configurations in the future, I'd like to rename the newly added `spark.sql.enableFallBackToHdfsForStats` configuration option to `spark.sql.statistics.fallBackToHdfs`. This allows us to put all statistics related configurations in the same namespace.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNone - just a usability

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR introduces more compact representation for `UnsafeArrayData`.\n\n`UnsafeArrayData` needs to accept `null` value in each entry of an array. In the current version, it has three parts\n\n```\n[numElements] [offsets] [values]\n```\n\n`Offsets` has the number of `numElements`, and represents `null` if its value is negative. It may increase memory footprint, and introduces an indirection for accessing each of `values`.\n\nThis PR uses bitvectors to represent nullability for each element like `UnsafeRow`, and eliminates an indirection for accessing each element. The new `UnsafeArrayData` has four parts.\n\n```\n[numElements][null bits][values or offset&length][variable length portion]\n```\n\nIn the `null bits` region, we store 1 bit per element, represents whether an element is null. Its total size is ceil(numElements / 8) bytes, and it is aligned to 8-byte boundaries.\nIn the `values or offset&length` region, we store the content of elements. For fields that hold fixed-length primitive types, such as long, double, or int, we store the value directly in the field. For fields with non-primitive or variable-length values, we store a relative offset (w.r.t. the base address of the array) that points to the beginning of the variable-length field and length (they are combined into a long). Each is word-aligned. For `variable length portion`, each is aligned to 8-byte boundaries.\n\nThe new format can reduce memory footprint and improve performance of accessing each element. An example of memory foot comparison:\n1024x1024 elements integer array\nSize of `baseObject` for `UnsafeArrayData`: 8 + 1024x1024 + 1024x1024 = 2M bytes\nSize of `baseObject` for `UnsafeArrayData`: 8 + 1024x1024/8 + 1024x1024 = 1.25M bytes\n\nIn summary, we got 1.0-2.6x performance improvements over the code before applying this PR.\nHere are performance results of [benchmark programs](https://github.com/kiszk/spark/blob/04d2e4b6dbdc4eff43ce18b3c9b776e0129257c7/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/benchmark/UnsafeArrayDataBenchmark.scala):\n\n**Read

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds the support of conf `hive.metastore.warehouse.dir` back. With this patch, the way of setting the warehouse dir is described as follows:\n- If `spark.sql.warehouse.dir` is set, `hive.metastore.warehouse.dir` will be automatically set to the value of `spark.sql.warehouse.dir`. The warehouse dir is effectively set to the value of `spark.sql.warehouse.dir`. \n- If `spark.sql.warehouse.dir` is not set but `hive.metastore.warehouse.dir` is set, `spark.sql.warehouse.dir` will be automatically set to the value of `hive.metastore.warehouse.dir`. The warehouse dir is effectively set to the value of `hive.metastore.warehouse.dir`.\n- If neither `spark.sql.warehouse.dir` nor `hive.metastore.warehouse.dir` is set, `hive.metastore.warehouse.dir` will be automatically set to the default value of `spark.sql.warehouse.dir`. The warehouse dir is effectively set to the default value of `spark.sql.warehouse.dir`. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\n`set hive.metastore.warehouse.dir` in `HiveSparkSubmitSuite`.\n\nJIRA:

This is not the case as soon as we use a `WITH` to define common table expressions, for example:\n\n``` sql\nWITH\ntbl AS (SELECT * FROM x WHERE id = 10)\nINSERT INTO y\nSELECT *\nFROM   tbl\n```\n\nThis PR fixes this problem.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis pull request refactors parts of the DAGScheduler to improve readability, focusing on the code around stage creation.  One goal of this change it to make it clearer which functions may create new stages (as opposed to looking up stages that already exist).  There are no functionality changes in this pull request.  In more detail:\n- shuffleToMapStage was renamed to shuffleIdToMapStage (when reading the existing code I have sometimes struggled to remember what the key is -- is it a stage? A stage id? This change is intended to avoid that confusion)\n- Cleaned up the code to create shuffle map stages.  Previously, creating a shuffle map stage involved 3 different functions (newOrUsedShuffleStage, newShuffleMapStage, and getShuffleMapStage), and it wasn't clear what the purpose of each function was.  With the new code, a single function (getOrCreateShuffleMapStage) is responsible for getting a stage (if it already exists) or creating new shuffle map stages and any missing ancestor stages, and it delegates to createShuffleMapStage when new stages need to be created.  There's some remaining confusion here because the getOrCreateParentStages call in createShuffleMapStage may recursively create ancestor stages; this is an issue I plan to fix in a future pull request, because it's trickier to fix and involves a slight functionality change.\n- newResultStage was renamed to createResultStage, for consistency with naming around shuffle map stages.\n- getParentStages has been renamed to getOrCreateParentStages, to make it clear that this function will sometimes create missing ancestor stages.\n- The only _slight_ functionality change is that on line 478, updateJobIdStageIdMaps now uses a stage's parents instance variable rather than re-calculating them (I couldn't see any reason why they'd need to be re-calculated, and suspect this is just leftover from older code).\n- getAncestorShuffleDependencies was renamed to getMissingAncestorShuffleDependencies, to make it clear that this only returns dependencies that have not yet been run.\n\ncc @squito @markhamstra @JoshRosen (who requested more DAG scheduler commenting long ago -- an issue this pull request tries, in part, to address)\n\nFYI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`RFormula` will index label only when it is string type currently. If the label is numeric type and we use `RFormula` to present a classification model, there is no label attributes in label column metadata. The label attributes are useful when making prediction for classification, so we can force to index label by `StringIndexer` whether it is numeric or string type for classification. Then SparkR wrappers can extract label attributes from label column metadata successfully. This feature can help us to fix bug similar with [SPARK-15153](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15153).\nFor regression, we will still to keep label as numeric type.\nIn this PR, we add a param `indexLabel` to control whether to force to index label for `RFormula`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSeveral places set the seed Param default value to None which will translate to a zero value on the Scala side.  This is unnecessary because a default fixed value already exists and if a test depends on a zero valued seed, then it should explicitly set it to zero instead of relying on this translation.  These cases can be safely removed except for the ALS doc test, which has been changed to set the seed value to zero.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRan PySpark tests

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nTwo issues I've found for \"show databases\" command:\n1. The returned database name list was not sorted, it only works when \"like\" was used together; (HIVE will always return a sorted list)\n2. When it is used as sql(\"show databases\").show, it will output a table with column named as \"result\", but for sql(\"show tables\").show, it will output the column name as \"tableName\", so I think we should be consistent and use \"databaseName\" at least.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUpdated existing test case to test its ordering as well.\n","created_at":"2016-06-14T21:31:35Z","updated_at":"2016-06-15T02:54:18Z","closed_at":"2016-06-15T01:37:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"604bf00435140efab100a80e5ec70314f9d53865","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13671/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13671/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13671/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d6b0f860352cf9e4a71e746c7f9bd035e9e243e5","head":{"label":"bomeng:SPARK-15952","ref":"SPARK-15952","sha":"d6b0f860352cf9e4a71e746c7f9bd035e9e243e5","user":{"login":"bomeng","id":295781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTc4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/295781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng","html_url":"https://github.com/bomeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"dae4d5db21368faaa46fa8d1a256c27428694c2c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdded links to logs (or an indication that there are no logs) for entries which list an executor in the stage details page of the UI.\n\nThis helps streamline the workflow where a user views a stage details page and determines that they would like to see the associated executor log for further examination.  Previously, a user would have to cross reference the executor id listed on the stage details page with the corresponding entry on the executors tab.\n\nLink to the JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15885\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRan existing unit tests.\nRan test queries on a platform which did not record executor logs and again on a platform which did record executor logs and verified that the new table column was populated with \"No Logs Found\" and links to the logs (which were verified as linking to the appropriate files), respectively.\n\nAttached is a screenshot of the UI page with no links, with the new columns highlighted.  Additional screenshot of these columns with the populated links.\n\nWithout links:\n![screen shot 2016-06-13 at 4 19 49 pm

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR eliminates unreachable code at projection for complex types (e.g. array, map, and struct)  to reduce the total size of Java byte code in a method generated by whole stage codegen.\nThis PR eliminates the following code blocks in the following cases:\n1. `project_value is` `null`\n2. each element of `project_values` is `null` if it never occurs\n\nExamples for complex types\n\n``` java\n    val df = sparkContext.parallelize(Seq(0.1, 0.2), 1).toDF(\"v\")\n    df.selectExpr(\"Array(v + 2.2, v + 3.3)\").collect\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR provides conversion utils between old/new vector columns in a DataFrame. So users can use it to migrate their datasets and pipelines manually. The methods are implemented under `MLUtils` and called `convertVectorColumnsToML` and `convertVectorColumnsFromML`. Both take a DataFrame and a list of vector columns to be converted. It is a no-op on vector columns that are already converted. A warning message is logged if actual conversion happens.\n\nThis is the first sub-task under SPARK-15944 to make it easier to migrate existing pipelines to Spark 2.0.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests in Scala and Java.\n\ncc: @yanboliang

What changes were proposed in this pull\n\n(Paste from JIRA issue.)\nAs a follow up for SPARK-15697, I have following semantics for `:reset` command.\nOn `:reset` we forget all that user has done but not the initialization of spark. To avoid confusion or make it more clear, we show the message `spark` and `sc` are not erased, infact they are in same state as they were left by previous operations done by the user.\nWhile doing above, somewhere I felt that this is not usually what reset means. But an accidental shutdown of a cluster can be very costly, so may be in that sense this is less surprising and still useful.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually, by calling `:reset` command, by both altering the state of SparkContext and creating some local variables.\n","created_at":"2016-06-14T11:08:03Z","updated_at":"2016-06-19T19:13:41Z","closed_at":"2016-06-19T19:13:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"623ec007df94b55e157f962ffb5d0293cf7b114c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13661/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13661/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13661/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4a709123df115a86820f545481ff9e047e8143a5","head":{"label":"ScrapCodes:repl-reset-command","ref":"repl-reset-command","sha":"4a709123df115a86820f545481ff9e047e8143a5","user":{"login":"ScrapCodes","id":992952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjk1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/992952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes","html_url":"https://github.com/ScrapCodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17210717,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIxMDcxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"ScrapCodes/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ScrapCodes","id":992952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjk1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/992952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes","html_url":"https://github.com/ScrapCodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ScrapCodes/spark","description":"Mirror

Besides confidence, \"Support\" is another critical property for Association rule. \nReferences: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning\nhttp://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/index.php?link=documentation.php#allassociationrules\nhttps://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar/dmbook/ch6.pdf\n\n`Support` can be either the count of appearances or the fraction within the dataset. I choose to use the count as:\n1. API compatibility: Currently both FPGrowthModel and Association Rule does not have the information about size of the dataset. I'd try to avoid breaking a list of public APIs.\n2. This also refers to the API of SPMF. http://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/index.php?link=documentation.php#allassociationrules.\n\nIn the next steps, we could add constraint like minSupport as in other libraries. FPGrowthModel should also contains the size of the dataset.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting ut.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently the Executors table sorts by id using a string sort (since that's what it is stored as). Since  the id is a number (other than the driver) we should be sorting numerically. I have changed both the initial sort on page load as well as the table sort to sort on id numerically, treating non-numeric strings (like the driver) as \"-1\"\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, the DataFrameReader/Writer has method that are needed for streaming and non-streaming DFs. This is quite awkward because each method in them through runtime exception for one case or the other. So rather having half the methods throw runtime exceptions, its just better to have a different reader/writer API for streams.\n- [x] Python API!!\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting unit tests + two sets of unit tests for DataFrameReader/Writer and DataStreamReader/Writer.\n","created_at":"2016-06-13T23:35:58Z","updated_at":"2016-06-15T01:24:18Z","closed_at":"2016-06-15T01:00:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"19a9d5b3e5bf7ee4c5b2876d874a5168466d1817","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13653/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13653/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13653/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/29ca23b74c16440dbb1e440423615357ec8015bf","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-15933","ref":"SPARK-15933","sha":"29ca23b74c16440dbb1e440423615357ec8015bf","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nInternally, we use Int to represent a date (the days since 1970-01-01), when we convert that into unix timestamp (milli-seconds since epoch in UTC), we get the offset of a timezone using local millis (the milli-seconds since 1970-01-01 in a timezone), but TimeZone.getOffset() expect unix timestamp, the result could be off by one hour (in Daylight Saving Time (DST) or not).\n\nThis PR change to use best effort approximate of posix timestamp to lookup the offset. In the event of changing of DST, Some time is not defined (for example, 2016-03-13 02:00:00 PST), or could lead to multiple valid result in UTC (for example, 2016-11-06 01:00:00), this best effort approximate should be enough in practice.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded regression

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIt is useful to get the variance of predictions from the `RandomForestRegressor` to plot confidence intervals on the predictions. I verified the formula from page 17 of this paper (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.0906v2.pdf)\nThe returned dataframe now has a column `variance` that can be set by `setVarianceCol` that calculates the variance.\n\nThe variance is calculated by summing up the mean of the variance of each decision tree + mean of the prediction^2 of each tree - square(mean of the prediction of each tree)\n\nThis pull request is highly inspired from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/8866/files\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI added a couple of tests to the RandomForestRegression test suite.\n","created_at":"2016-06-13T21:36:13Z","updated_at":"2020-01-20T00:05:25Z","closed_at":"2020-01-20T00:05:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"43412f9dee907ee4a27dfeff1d19eba186f05fdb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13650/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13650/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13650/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/505e3c289f19f5d04f9fd51d8f5050822f155738","head":{"label":"MechCoder:random_forest_var","ref":"random_forest_var","sha":"505e3c289f19f5d04f9fd51d8f5050822f155738","user":{"login":"MechCoder","id":1867024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjcwMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1867024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MechCoder","html_url":"https://github.com/MechCoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MechCoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MechCoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MechCoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MechCoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MechCoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MechCoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MechCoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MechCoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MechCoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23950071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzk1MDA3MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"MechCoder/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MechCoder","id":1867024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjcwMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1867024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MechCoder","html_url":"https://github.com/MechCoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MechCoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MechCoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MechCoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MechCoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MechCoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MechCoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MechCoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MechCoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MechCoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MechCoder/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn our encoder framework, we imply that serializer expressions should use `BoundReference` to refer to the input object, and a lot of codes depend on this contract(e.g. ExpressionEncoder.tuple).  This PR adds some document and assert in `ExpressionEncoder` to make it clearer.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is to add Power Iteration Clustering (`PIC`) to `spark.ml`. The implementation is similar to Kmeans, but there are some fundamental difference (also mentioned in the JIRA SPARK-15784):\n1. The input of PIC is a similarity matrix. In this spark.ml implementation, the similarity matrix is represented as dataframe with each row of being a tuple (i, j, s_ij) in `spark.mllib` implementation.\n2. PIC is a graph algorithm. Therefore, the output is a cluster assignment of vertices. It implies that the input.size != output.size.\n3. PIC is different from Kmeans in terms of prediction. We can't compute a probability to determine new data cluster membership with a trained model, because PIC requires to re-compute the pseudo-eigenvector `v`. \n\nConsidering the above differences, I made the following changes for PIC in `spark.ml`:\n\nFor prediction in `PowerIterationClusteringModel`, it takes a new Dataset, instead of single row of a matrix entry. The output is Dataframe of cluster assignments, with vertex indexes as `features`. Note that using input similarity matrix as `features` doesn't make sense. \n\nFor transform in `PowerIterationClusteringModel`, it calls the `PowerIterationClusteringModel.predict` to convert a Dataset to cluster assignment Dataframe.  \n\nFor `PowerIterationClustering.fit`, it returns a `PowerIterationClusteringModel` instance and saves the parameters to get the model, because `PowerIterationClusteringModel.predict` will need these parameters.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. E.g. unit tests, integration tests, manual tests)\nAdd unit tests which are similar to `spark.mllib` but in Dataframe. Also add tests of prediction and transform. Manual tests.\n","created_at":"2016-06-13T19:53:18Z","updated_at":"2016-11-01T17:56:03Z","closed_at":"2016-11-01T17:56:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2d2369d3c10c0de57bbace589703ea60743c99cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13647/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13647/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13647/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5189ba0ddc5effce3ea2ce10179cf611d26e0007","head":{"label":"wangmiao1981:pic","ref":"pic","sha":"5189ba0ddc5effce3ea2ce10179cf611d26e0007","user":{"login":"wangmiao1981","id":5033592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzM1OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5033592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981","html_url":"https://github.com/wangmiao1981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":41932153,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTkzMjE1Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"wangmiao1981/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangmiao1981","id":5033592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzM1OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5033592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981","html_url":"https://github.com/wangmiao1981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangmiao1981/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR  inserts the correct parenthesis between top level `AND` operators.\n\nFor example, the where clause below:\n\n```\nWHERE (NAME = 'fred' OR THEID = 100) AND THEID < 1\n```\n\nis being parsed as below:\n\n```\nWHERE (NAME = 'fred') OR (THEID = 100) AND (THEID < 1)\n```\n\nThis is fine for other sub filters for each element in `Array[Filter]` but it is not considering the parenthesis and precedence with `AND` between elements in `Array[Filter]`.\n\nThis PR produces the correct condition as below:\n\n```\nWHERE ((NAME = 'fred') OR (THEID = 100)) AND (THEID < 1)\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test in `JDBCSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-06-13T10:39:45Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:42:42Z","closed_at":"2016-06-18T00:13:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9bc55ed5376f2256c2e1e9a9c745e911b33baebe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13640/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13640/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13640/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6d2580a8cc3d0ac12158e71b487f11be7c1353c7","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-15916","ref":"SPARK-15916","sha":"6d2580a8cc3d0ac12158e71b487f11be7c1353c7","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

localRelation = Seq(1, 2, 3).toDF()\n    localRelation.createOrReplaceTempView(\"localRelation\")\n\n    spark.catalog.cacheTable(\"localRelation\")\n    assert(\n      localRelation.queryExecution.withCachedData.collect {\n        case i: InMemoryRelation => i\n      }.size == 1)\n```\n\nand this will fail as:\n\n```\nArrayBuffer() had size 0 instead of expected size 1\n```\n\nThe reason is that when do `spark.catalog.cacheTable(\"localRelation\")`, `CacheManager` tries to cache for the plan wrapped by `SubqueryAlias` but when planning for the DataFrame `localRelation`, `CacheManager` tries to find cached table for the not-wrapped plan because the plan for DataFrame `localRelation` is not wrapped.\nSome plans like `LocalRelation`, `LogicalRDD`, etc. override `sameResult` method, but not use canonicalized plan to compare so the `CacheManager` can't detect the plans are the same.\n\nThis pr modifies them to use canonicalized plan when override `sameResult` method.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a test to check if DataFrame with plan overriding sameResult but not using canonicalized plan to compare can cacheTable.\n","created_at":"2016-06-13T07:16:17Z","updated_at":"2016-06-14T19:05:28Z","closed_at":"2016-06-14T17:54:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"38a865a3550e57f48b4911254c009eeb8f184c69","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13638/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13638/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13638/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0c9ec86f7e2646466b91d75b26dc29de31b98d31","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-15915","ref":"issues/SPARK-15915","sha":"0c9ec86f7e2646466b91d75b26dc29de31b98d31","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR introduces the new SparkSession API for SparkR.\n`sparkR.session.getOrCreate()` and `sparkR.session.stop()`\n\n\"getOrCreate\" is a bit unusual in R but it's important to name this clearly.\n\nSparkR implementation should\n- SparkSession is the main entrypoint (vs SparkContext; due to limited functionality supported with SparkContext in SparkR)\n- SparkSession replaces SQLContext and HiveContext (both a wrapper around SparkSession, and because of API changes, supporting all 3 would be a lot more work)\n- Changes to SparkSession is mostly transparent to users due to SPARK-10903\n- Full backward compatibility is expected - users should be able to initialize everything just in Spark 1.6.1 (`sparkR.init()`), but with deprecation warning\n- Mostly cosmetic changes to parameter list - users should be able to move to `sparkR.session.getOrCreate()` easily\n- An advanced syntax with named parameters (aka varargs aka \"...\") is supported; that should be closer to the Builder syntax that is in Scala/Python (which unfortunately does not work in R because it will look like this: `enableHiveSupport(config(config(master(appName(builder(), \"foo\"), \"local\"), \"first\", \"value\"), \"next, \"value\"))`\n- Updating config on an existing SparkSession is supported, the behavior is the same as Python, in which config is applied to both SparkContext and SparkSession\n- Some SparkSession changes are not matched in SparkR, mostly because it would be breaking API change: `catalog` object, `createOrReplaceTempView`\n- Other SQLContext workarounds are replicated in SparkR, eg. `tables`, `tableNames`\n- `sparkR` shell is updated to use the SparkSession entrypoint (`sqlContext` is removed, just like with Scale/Python) \n- All tests are updated to use the SparkSession entrypoint\n- A bug in `read.jdbc` is fixed\n\nTODO\n- [x] Add more tests\n- [ ] Separate PR - update all roxygen2 doc coding example\n- [ ] Separate PR - update SparkR programming guide\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nunit tests, manual tests\n\n@shivaram @sun-rui @rxin

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR enforces schema check when converting DataFrame to Dataset using Kryo encoder. For example.\n\n**Before the change:**\n\nSchema is NOT checked when converting DataFrame to Dataset using kryo encoder.\n\n```\nscala> case class B(b: Int)\nscala> implicit val encoder = Encoders.kryo[B]\nscala> val df = Seq((1)).toDF(\"b\")\nscala> val ds = df.as[B] // Schema compatibility is NOT checked\n```\n\n**After the change:**\nReport AnalysisException since the schema is NOT compatible. \n\n```\nscala> val ds = Seq((1)).toDF(\"b\").as[B]\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: cannot resolve 'CAST(`b` AS BINARY)' due to data type mismatch: cannot cast IntegerType to BinaryType;\n...\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13619 was merged into master, branch-2.0 but branch-1.6 as well.\n\nThis is currently being failed due to the use of `spark` instead of `sqlContext` but it even fails after changing this to `sqlContext`. \n\nIt seems the reason is the behaviour was changed in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/101663f1ae222a919fc40510aa4f2bad22d1be6f.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis pull request fixes the COUNT bug in the `RewriteCorrelatedScalarSubquery` rule.\n\nAfter this change, the rule tests the expression at the root of the correlated subquery to determine whether the expression returns `NULL` on empty input. If the expression does not return `NULL`, the rule generates additional logic in the `Project` operator above the rewritten subquery. This additional logic intercepts `NULL` values coming from the outer join and replaces them with the value that the subquery's expression would return on empty input.\n\nThis PR takes over https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13155. It only fixes an issue with `Literal` construction and style issues.  All credits should go @frreiss.\n# How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded regression tests to cover all branches of the updated rule (see changes to `SubquerySuite`).\nRan all existing automated regression tests after merging with latest trunk.\n","created_at":"2016-06-13T00:01:12Z","updated_at":"2016-06-13T04:32:20Z","closed_at":"2016-06-13T04:32:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"61093ef7631abe1c14f36c68e0f3fc594f1db626","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13629/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13629/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13629/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/30dd0bd7d560151085e53667fcc4f6a8895844ed","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-15370-cleanup","ref":"SPARK-15370-cleanup","sha":"30dd0bd7d560151085e53667fcc4f6a8895844ed","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror
