Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #9720.\r\nI have manually tested the fix. \r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes a logging bug in the `BatchAppendrator` class when hydrants are persisted. The bug is that the count of hydrants before this class was added was being kept in the `IncrementalIndex` and obtained using its `getCount()` method. Now the hydrant count is being kept in the new `sinksMetadata` that keeps tracks of `Sink` metadata (such as the hydrant count). The reason to change the place for keeping that count is that Sinks & Hydrants are no longer kept in memory as soon as they are persisted. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nThis PR adds support for handling null dimension values while creating partition boundaries\r\nin range partitioning.\r\n\r\nThis means that we can now have partition boundaries like `[null, \"abc\"]` or `[\"abc\", null, \"def\"]`.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the following problems seen in production environments.\r\n- In cases of very sparse data, where there is no row that contains non-null values\r\n  for all partition dimensions, partitioning just doesn't work. This is because all the rows\r\n  are ignored in the `PartialDimensionDistributionTask` and `intervalToPartitions` turns\r\n  out to be empty.\r\n- If there are too many rows where the first partition dimension is null, all of them would\r\n  end up in the first partition thus bloating up that partition. This can now be mitigated in\r\n  cases where the later dimensions have non-null values which vary over these rows.\r\n\r\n#### The tuple of nulls\r\nPlease note that even though `[null, null]` is also a valid boundary now, it will never actually\r\nbe encountered in practice. This is because lexicographically, the null tuple is\r\nimmediately followed the tuple of nulls. i.e. `null < [null, null]`\r\nThus, if the start and end of a partition were `null` and `[null, null]` respectively,\r\nthat partition would contain zero rows (end is not inclusive). There would be no\r\npoint in having such a partition and so it never occurs in practice.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n * Do not skip nulls in `PartialDimensionDistributionTask`\r\n * Add a null-safe serde to use instead of `ArrayOfStringsSerde`\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThe null-safe impl of `ArrayOfStringsSerde` can be removed once it is contributed\r\nback to apache-datasketches itself.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nIssue:\r\n`DruidRexExecutor` while reducing Arrays, specially numeric arrays, doesn't convert the value from ExprResult's type to BigDecimal, which causes `makeLiteral` to cast the values. Also, if NaN or Infinite values are present in the array, the error is a generic  `NumberFormatException`. For example:\r\n\r\n`SELECT ARRAY[1.11, 2.22]` returns [1, 2]\r\n`SELECT SQRT(-1)` throws a generic `NumberFormatException` instead of `IAE`\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces change to cast the numeric values to `BigDecimal` since Calcite's library understands that easily, and doesn't perform casts. \r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DruidRexExecutor#reduce()`\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThere are many interactive CLI tools which discard unfinished input when user hits Ctrl-C: shells, REPLs (`jshell`, `python`, etc.), interactive clients (`psql`, `openstack`, etc.).

PR:\r\n- Adds a `/{id}/parseErrors` API to `SupervisorResource` which gathers parse exceptions from a supervisor's subtasks. The supervisor internally keeps track of a limited sorted list of parse exceptions (so that parse exceptions do not disappear from this API when tasks transition from one task duration period to the next). This list is limited to `taskCount * maxSavedParseExceptions` entries. The list returned by the supervisor is sorted by time.\r\n- Parse exceptions are now returned as a structured `ParseExceptionReport` with a timestamp of occurrence, the input that failed to parse (if available), a type string indicating whether the row was completely unparseable or if there were only partial errors, and a list of detail messages (containing the message string from the exceptions)\r\n- Simplifies the parse exception message for parseable rows that had a column typing error: only the \"event\" from the `MapBasedInputRow` is printed now, e.g. `  \"2021-11-20T04:43:55.311Z, Found unparseable columns in row: [{__time=2015-09-12T02:47:05.474Z, a=world, b=unparseable_b_long, d=12}], exceptions: [Unable to parse value[unparseable_b_long] for field[b]]\",\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\n curl http://localhost:8888/druid/indexer/v1/supervisor/parsetestkafka/parseErrors\r\n\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"input\": \"{__time=unparseable_time, a=world, b=unparseable_b_long, d=12}\",\r\n    \"errorType\": \"unparseable\",\r\n    \"details\": [\r\n      \"Timestamp[unparseable_time] is unparseable!

release notes suggestion**\r\n\r\nThe dynamic coordinator config, `percentOfSegmentsToConsiderPerMove` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Druid. It is being replaced by a new segment picking strategy introduced in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/11257. This new strategy is currently toggled off by default, but can be toggled on if you set the dynamic coordinator config `useBatchedSegmentSampler` to `true`.

There is a case in the code where the deprecated code can be executed despite, the dynamic config for batched segment sampling being enabled. In [this](https://github.com/yuanlihan/druid/blob/b02a9e659846a88c7be375ffb805340c38d1dbf5/server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/server/coordinator/duty/BalanceSegments.java#L198) line of code, if `useBatchedSegmentSampler() == true` and `maxSegmentsToMove == 1`, you would expect the batched segment sampler code to execute. However, you can see [here](https://github.com/yuanlihan/druid/blob/b02a9e659846a88c7be375ffb805340c38d1dbf5/server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/server/coordinator/BalancerStrategy.java#L82) that the new batched sampler is not used in this case because reservoir size is 1. This PR fixes this behavior by splitting `BalancerStrategy#pickSegmentsToMove(List<ServerHolder>, Set<String>, int, double)` into two methods using overloading - one for the new batched sampler, and one for the deprecated way of sampling one segment at a time. This change will also simplify cleanup of the deprecated code in what I assume will be the 0.24.X cycle.\r\n\r\n#### Cleaned up the code for the competing segment pick strategies (deprecated vs batched segment sampler)\r\n\r\nI did a few things to make the code more understandable and to make it abundantly clear that the old way of sampling segments to move with the help of the dynamic config `percentOfSegmentsToConsiderPerMove` is deprecated:\r\n* Added `@Deprecated` annotations to the `CoordinatorDynamicConfig` code related to `percentOfSegmentsToConsiderPerMove`\r\n* Updated the Coordinator Dynamic Config docs to explicitly state that `percentOfSegmentsToConsiderPerMove` is deprecated and will have no effect if `useBatchedSegmentSampler` dynamic config is `true`\r\n* Split `BalancerStrategy#pickSegmentsToMove` into two methods with the same name and overloaded arguments. One implementation is deprecated and takes a double for `percentOfSegmentsToConsiderPerMove` while the other is the new batched sampler which takes an `int` for the reservoir size.\r\n  * This change also makes `BalanceSegments#balanceServers` more understandable to those with limited familiarity with this work to migrate to the batched segment sampler. Before the call to `BalancerStrategy#pickSegmentsToMove` was opaque because it included both the reservoir size and the percent of segments to consider per move despite only one of those arguments being used depending on the value of the reservoir size (this also relates to the unintended code execution I talk about above). The new way makes it clear that if batched segment sampling is enabled, the non-deprecated `pickSegmentsToMove` is called. And if it is not, the deprecated `pickSegmentsToMove` is called. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

patch is doing parts 1–3 and 5 from the \"Proposed changes\" in #11929. Nothing is exposed to end users as a result of this patch. It's just changes to the planner that enable understanding and authorizing INSERTs, and writing some initial tests. The main logic is in **DruidPlanner** and the main tests are in **CalciteInsertDmlTest**. Major things you _won't_ find are the ability to actually execute INSERT queries (that needs a new QueryMaker) and the ability to handle PARTITION BY and CLUSTER BY (that will require parser changes). Those would be done in follow-on patches.\r\n\r\nThe main changes are:\r\n\r\n1) DruidPlanner is able to validate and authorize INSERT queries. They require WRITE permission on the target datasource.\r\n\r\n2) QueryMaker is now an interface, and there is a QueryMakerFactory that creates instances of it. There is only one production implementation of each (NativeQueryMaker and NativeQueryMakerFactory), which together behave the same way as the former QueryMaker class. But this opens the door to executing queries in ways other than the Druid query stack, and is used by unit tests (CalciteInsertDmlTest) to test the INSERT planning functionality.\r\n\r\n3) Adds an EXTERN table macro that allows references external data using InputSource and InputFormat from Druid's batch ingestion API. This is not exposed in production yet, but is used by unit tests.\r\n\r\n4) Adds a QueryFeature concept that enables the planner to change its behavior slightly depending on the capabilities of the execution system.\r\n\r\n5) Adds an \"AuthorizableOperator\" concept that enables SqlOperators to require additional permissions. This is used by the EXTERN table macro.\r\n\r\nRelated odds and ends:\r\n\r\n- Add equals, hashCode, toString methods to InlineInputSource. Aids in the \"from external\" tests in CalciteInsertDmlTest.\r\n- Add JSON-serializability to RowSignature.\r\n- Move the SQL string inside PlannerContext so it is \"baked into\" the planner when the planner is created. Cleans up the code a bit, since in practice, the same query is passed in every time to the same planner anyway.","created_at":"2021-11-19T21:52:13Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T07:38:27Z","closed_at":"2021-11-24T20:14:05Z","merged_at":"2021-11-24T20:14:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"0354407655db335d6a99da3f7d81bd6aeae81fa0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":690563172,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMxNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20SQL","name":"Area

a \"guessAggregatorHeapFootprint\" method to AggregatorFactory that mitigates #6743 by enabling heap footprint estimates based on a specific number of rows. The idea is that at ingestion time, the number of rows that go into an aggregator will be 1 (if rollup is off) or will likely be a small number (if rollup is on).\r\n\r\nIt's a heuristic, because of course nothing guarantees that the rollup ratio is a small number. But it's a common case, and I expect this logic to go wrong much less often than the current logic. Also, when it does go wrong, users can fix it by lowering maxRowsInMemory or maxBytesInMemory. The current situation is unintuitive: when the estimation goes wrong, users get an OOME, but actually they need to *raise* these limits to fix it.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is an ideal solution. In the future, I'd like to see something that involves the IncrementalIndex having much more direct control over how much memory it uses. Probably in concert with implementing off-heap resizeable aggregators, which is a feature that would be very nice to have for other reasons too. But in the meantime, the approach in this patch is simple, non-invasive, and I think it will help people.","created_at":"2021-11-18T21:59:10Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T19:18:07Z","closed_at":"2021-11-28T07:51:24Z","merged_at":"2021-11-28T07:51:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"93aeaf4801f65826f01cac0a3eedb4b4d3fdecef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

Description\r\nThe `S3Entity` reads objects (i.e. files)  stored in an AWS bucket using a stream. Often those files are large and S3 may drop the connection. One of the symptoms of a dropped connection is an exception coming from the AWS client sdk like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2021-10-13T01:04:21,019 ERROR [task-runner-0-priority-0] org.apache.druid.indexing.common.task.batch.parallel.SinglePhaseSubTask - Encountered exception in parallel sub task.\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: java.io.IOException: com.amazonaws.SdkClientException: Data read has a different length than the expected: dataLength=589456583; expectedLength=4288561114; includeSkipped=true; in.getClass()=class com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3Client$2; markedSupported=false; marked=0; resetSinceLastMarked=false; markCount=0; resetCount=0\r\n\tat org.apache.commons.io.LineIterator.hasNext(LineIterator.java:108) ~[commons-io-2.11.0.jar:2.11.0]\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.data.input.TextReader$1.hasNext(TextReader.java:73) \r\n``` \r\n\r\nToday this exception in the code is not considered retry-able. In addition, the current code in `org.apache.druid.data.input.impl.RetryinInputStrem` has a private \"reset condition\". The retry condition simply retries inserting sleeps in between but the reset condition actually first resets the input stream in the offset where it left off, reopens, and retries. \r\n\r\nFor the exception above we want to add a custom \"reset condition\" (similar to the already existing custom \"retry condition\") that the S3entity can use to signal that the above exception should be resettable.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements that custom resettable condition and adds the proper condition to the `S3Entty` so that it can recover from such exception.\r\n\r\n### Algorithmic choices\r\nAnother choice could have been to use the [Amazon's SDK TransferManager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/TransferManager.html) or `org.apache.druid.data.input.InputEntity#fetch` to completely download the S3 object to local storage and then fetch from there. But we decided to leave this for future work if needed since reset & retry may be enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `InputEntity`\r\n * `RetryingInputStream`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\nLoadRule may drop all the segment replica unexpected! \r\n\r\nWhen LoadRule drops segment or BalanceSegments moves segment, the actual work will be done by asking LoadQueuePeon to load or drop segment asynchronously. This surely cause concurrent conflict problem. \r\n\r\nFor example, when BalanceSegments moves segment, it will first mark the segment to drop on fromServer and ask toServer to load, when load work done, the fromServer does drop work. If the LoadRule happens to check segment replica count after the load work done and before the drop occur, the  LoadRule will find there is  one segment to drop, it will then pick one server to drop the segment, mostly the fromServer will not be picked as it marked the segment to drop and so has smaller cost -- if you use CostBalancerStrategy. Then when the fromServer does drop, two replica will totally dropped! Especially when the tier config to one replica, there will be none segment replica serving!\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n### Approach\r\nTo solve the concurrent problem, we can make a snapshot of the unloading segments. If one segment is unloading in tier, the LoadRule should not drop the segment in the tier at this time.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `LoadRule`\r\n * `UpdateCoordinatorStateAndPrepareCluster`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nFixes bug were a peon task (supervisor?) makes a request to the leader (overlord) for a task report but the leader cannot find the report then the leader responds with something like:\r\n\r\n\"No task reports were found for this task. The task may not exist, or it may not have completed yet\r\n\r\nBut the client is expecting JSON to be returned. So client chokes with this response and dies with an exception like this one:\r\n\r\n``` \r\n2021-10-12T21:42:47,310 WARN [qtp1027158270-111] org.apache.druid.indexing.common.task.batch.parallel.ParallelIndexSuperv\\\r\n     isorTask - Encountered exception when getting live subtask report for task: single_phase_sub_task_test_100gb_125million_2\\\r\n     5segment_nmealobf_2021-10-12T21:42:37.944Z\r\n 584 java.lang.RuntimeException: com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParseException: Unrecognized token 'No': was expecting (JSON S\\\r\n     tring, Number, Array, Object or token 'null', 'true' or 'false')\r\n 585  at [Source: (String)\"No task reports were found for this task.

patch adds an API for requesting non-time orderings, although it does not actually add the ability to execute such queries.\r\n\r\nA key motivation is to enable ORDER BY tracking for INSERT described in #11929, which is why this patch is still useful even if it doesn't add the ability to execute Scan queries with non-time ordering. But I do think that would also be very useful, so I do think we will eventually add execution code for this parameter.\r\n\r\nThe changes are done in such a way that no matter how Scan query objects are constructed, they will have a correct \"getOrderBy\". This will enable us to switch the execution to exclusively use \"getOrderBy\" later on when it's implemented.\r\n\r\nScan queries are serialized such that they only include \"order\" (time order) if the ordering is time-based, and they only include \"orderBy\" if the ordering is non-time-based. This maximizes compatibility with the existing API while also providing a clean look for formatted queries.\r\n\r\nBecause this patch does not include execution logic, if someone actually tries to run a query with non-time ordering, then they will get an error like \"Cannot execute query with orderBy [quality ASC]\".","created_at":"2021-11-16T20:20:36Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T07:39:07Z","closed_at":"2021-11-19T16:19:12Z","merged_at":"2021-11-19T16:19:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"36ee0367ffa567c3af5d01fb33dbdf9870a39f8f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Description\r\nDruid literal expressions which produce complex constants should not be fully reduced by `DruidRexExecutor`, because they use a custom `SqlType`, `RowSignatures.ComplexSqlType`, which the underlying type factory of the rex builder doesn't know how to cope with, resulting in a stack overflow exception.\r\n\r\nReducing these expressions to a constant likely doesn't make sense anyway, since in many cases complex types are binaries, so `DruidRexExecutor` now ignores them.\r\n\r\nAdded a test for `DruidRexExecutor` that covers a case where the expression is expected to be reduced, and a case where it is not (since no complex literal expression are actually wired up to SQL yet, this fakes an operator for the hyperunique constructor expression).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key

Description\r\nFollow-up to #11829, this PR adds safeguards to prevent using `BitmapIndex` (which still relies on the underlying column using a String typed dictionary) from being used directly for non-virtual columns that are dictionary encoded, but not String typed. Virtual columns may still provide bitmap indexes, but only dictionary encoded string columns will supply them directly from the column after the changes of this patch.\r\n\r\nWe should be able to remove these in the future if we modify filtering to be more friendly to non-string types, but until then this will prevent funny class cast exceptions when filters notice that a column has a bitmap and so will use it, but then fail when actually trying to use them.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ColumnSelectorBitmapIndexSelector`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\nBug: `SELECT floor(123)` returns `1230`\r\n\r\n(In comparison, \r\n  `SELECT 123` returns `123`, \r\n  `SELECT floor(123) from druid.foo` returns `123`\r\n)\r\n\r\nCause: `DruidLogicalValuesRule` while transforming to `DruidRel` can return incorrect values, if during the creation of the literal it was created from a float value. The `BigDecimal` representation stores `123.0`, and it seems that using `RexLiteral's` method while conversion returns the __inflated__ value (which is 1230). I am unsure if this is intentional from Calcite's perspective, and the actual change should be done somewhere else. \r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\nExtract the values of INT/LONG from the RexLiteral in the `DruidLogicalValuesRule`, via `BigDecimal.longValue()` method.\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them.

Description\r\nThis PR renames `AggregatorFactory.getType` and `AggregatorFactory.getFinalizedType` to `getIntermediateType` and `getResultType`, and restores the previous 3 methods `getType`, `getFinalizedType`, and `getComplexTypeName` to their earlier incarnations before #11713, making default implementations of `getIntermediateType` and `getResultType` out of these previous methods. The previous methods all now have default implementation that explode so that they did not need restored to all existing `AggregatorFactory` implementations.\r\n\r\nThis is hella ugly, and now NONE of these methods are abstract, but it will be less disruptive to extension writers.\r\n\r\nI am going to effectively revert this after the 0.23 release, but this at least gives slightly more warning to extension writers than release notes.

The defaults for these circuit breaker configs are turned off by default.\r\n\r\nshort circuit 1: maxSegmentsIngested - short circuits the ingestion job if it is determined that the job will generate a number of segments greater than what is specified in the tuningConfig\r\n\r\nshort circuit 2: maxIntervalsIngested - short circuits the ingestion job if it is determined that the job will generate a number of segment intervals greater than what is specified in the tuningConfig\r\n\r\nThese short circuits only apply in certain scenarios:\r\n  * index_hadoop\r\n    * hashed partitioning\r\n      * both the segments circuit breaker and intervals circuit breaker are in effect if the job has to determine partitions\r\n    * single dim partitioning\r\n      * only the intervals circuit breaker is in effect if the job has to determine intervals at runtime\r\n  * index\r\n    * dynamic partitioning\r\n      * only the intervals circuit breaker is in effect if the job has to determine intervals at runtime\r\n    * hashed partitioning\r\n      * both the segments circuit breaker and intervals circuit breaker are in effect if the job has to determine partitions\r\n\r\nwhy not have both circuit breakers in effect for all batch job types?\r\n  * first of all, the circuit breakers only really make sense when the intervals and/or partitions are generated at runtime because this is a spec level config and if the spec knows the partitions and/or intervals due to explicit inclusion in the spec, the thresholds are not really needed.. the spec creator just needs to  not submit that spec.\r\n  * It was not obvious how this would be implemented for index_parallel due to the architecture of that task type\r\n  * It is not possible for dynamic partitioning in the `index` task type, because the partitions are generated dynamically when the segments are being generated.\r\n  * It was not obvious if it was possible to do the segments threshold for single_dim in `index_hadoop` \r\n\r\nWhy is this useful?\r\n  * Prevented jobs of unexpected or undesired size.\r\n    * my use case is a multi-tenant cluster where data engineers ingest their own data. we have control over the spec submit, but not what underlying data the spec points to. That is why it is helpful for us to inject these configs to prevent jobs from creating an obscene amount of segments that would hurt the quality of service for other users on the multi-tenant cluster. \r\n  * even in the case where the spec and data owner are the same. it may be useful for the spec owner to add these in order to guard against mistakenly creating something they did not intend to (perhaps generating far more number of segments than they wanted due to misunderstanding of underlying data being ingested)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nThis PR does two things\r\n - It adds the capability to surface missing features in SQL to users - The calcite planner will explore through multiple rules to convert a logical SQL query to a druid native query. Some rules change the shape of the query itself, optimize it and some rules are responsible for translating the query into a druid native query. These are DruidQueryRule, DruidOuterQueryRule, DruidJoinRule, DruidUnionDataSourceRule, DruidUnionRule etc. These rules will look at SQL and will do the necessary transformation. But if the rule can't transform the query, it returns back the control to the calcite planner without recording why was it not able to transform. E.g. there is a join query with a non-equal join condition. DruidJoinRule will look at the condition, see that it is not supported, and return back the control. The reason can be that a query can be planned in many different ways so if one rule can't parse it, the query may still be parseable by other rules. In this PR, we are intercepting these gaps and passing them back to the user if the query could not be planned at all. \r\n - The said capability has been used to generate actionable errors for some common unsupported SQL features. However, not all possible errors are covered and we can keep adding more in the future. \r\n \r\nThe code changes themselves are not intrusive and minimal. I have modified the `PlannerContext` to record any planning error and then use it when generating a user-facing exception. \r\n\r\nUpdate 22-Nov-2021\r\nI added a few more enhancements. In many places, we are throwing IAE, ISE exception during query planning e.g. when the query includes max aggregation on a string column, we throw ISE. This is caught by calcite, wrapped inside RuntimeException, and thrown up. This halts the processing and the error that uses gets to see in the console is not helpful at all since it is buried inside the cause chain. In this patch, I have replaced these exceptions with `UnsupportedSQLQueryException`. In DruidPlanner, the code tries to find the root cause that is of the type CannotPlanException. If such a cause is found, we extract the error and use that as the top-level error message. The reason behind using `UnsupportedSQLQueryException` is that we can be sure that this exception class will be populated with user-friendly error message. For any other CannotPlanningException, we return a generic error message. \r\n\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DruidPlanner`\r\n * `Druid*Rule`\r\n * `DruidUnionDataSourceRel`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, when we try to do `EXPLAIN PLAN FOR`, it returns the structure of the SQL parsed (via Calcite's internal planner util), which is verbose (since it tries to explain about the nodes in the SQL, instead of the Druid Query), and not representative of the native Druid query which will get executed on the broker side.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to change the format when user tries to `EXPLAIN PLAN FOR` for queries which are executed by converting them into Druid's native queries (i.e. not `sys` schemas).\r\n\r\nThe explanation now will be a list of columns with information about `resources` (no change) and `explanation`. \r\nExplanation is a string representing an array of queries & their signatures (in JSON format). Final shape of the `explanation` will look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  { \r\n    \"query\" : <native_druid_query>,\r\n    \"signature\": <signature of the query>\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"query\" : <native_druid_query>,\r\n    \"signature\": <signature of the query>\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\nExamples:\r\n1.

Gave the structure of the `RelNodes` formed from the SQL statement. This could help in understanding how the given query was arranged\r\n2. The older variation was verbose, and repetitive. See the examples above.  \r\n\r\nNewer Format\r\n1. Gives the native queries as is, therefore gives a clearer understanding of what is going to be run under the hood.\r\n2. JSON output has a fixed structure and could be parsed easily. \r\n3. Doesn't match the `EXPLAIN PLAN FOR` semantics of other databases like SQL/Oracle etc. (Can be said for the older version as well)\r\n4. Since a default public facing change is being made, this would cause the users to update their applications, if they are relying on the structure of the format. \r\n\r\nWe are using a external context flag to switch between legacy and native mode, and not relying on `EXPLAIN PLAN FOR ... AS JSON` since the latter should ideally only vary the format of the EXPLAIN PLAN and not the output itself (which is being done here). \r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * Modified implementation of `DruidPlanner#planExplanation`. \r\n * RowSignature implemented to be JSON serializable\r\n * `RowSignatureTest` for serializability\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

materializing list of segment files (it can cause OOM/memory pressure) as well as looping over the files.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis fixes a memory pressure/OOM bug seen in the field when the middlemanager may get an \"out of memory\" error because the list of segments is too large. Besides, looping through the segments files is inefficient and this commit avoids that. It does not need new unit tests, the existing unit tests cover this code already.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths,

fetching segments from S3, it presently creates an object summary(LIST operation) for the segment before proceeding to GET the object and so the number of LIST ops are proportional to the number of segments. Since LIST ops are more expensive compared to GET, it is desirable to reduce the number of list ops especially if the LIST limit Is much smaller than for GETs.\r\n\r\nThis PR lazily creates the object summary  since it isn't really required for pulling segments since the bucket and prefix can be retrieved from the URI and the check to validate if the object is present in the bucket is already done before attempting to pull the segment. This reduces the list operations down to zero while pulling segments.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new

Description\r\n\r\nAdded a config, `rejectRowIfParsingError` parameter to tuningConfig, which allows a user to specify that any rows that are found during ingestion to have parsing errors, should be deemed `unparseable` and discarded, instead of the existing behavior of retaining the row, but filling the column(s) which caused parsing error to be null value. The new parameter is disabled by default, which will retain the existing behavior.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n#11713 changed the segment metadata query column analysis `type` field, but this might not be very friendly to actual users (e.g. not `DruidSchema`) who are calling this query directly because, merging query results of mixed versions of Druid would result in an error due to mismatched types. \r\n\r\nThis PR reverts `type` to its original behavior, and adds a new `typeSignature` which is used by `DruidSchema`. Error messaging when merging `ColumnAnalysis` has also been improved to include the mismatched types involved in the merge.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n *

routing data through a HTTP proxy\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis adds the ability for the HttpClient to connect through a HTTP proxy.  We\r\naugment the channel factory to check if it is supposed to be proxied and, if so,\r\nwe connect to the proxy host first, issue a CONNECT command through to the final\r\nrecipient host and *then* give the channel to the normal http client for usage.\r\n\r\nNote that this is most useful for any extension (within Druid) that is using Druid's HttpClient and needs to make requests to endpoints outside of the Druid network where proxy is required. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR has changes to ensure backward compatibility of multi dimension partitioning\r\nsuch that if some middle managers are upgraded to a newer version, the cluster still\r\nfunctions normally for single_dim use cases.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Make `BuildingSingleDimensionShardSpec` extend `BuildingDimensionRangeShardSpec`\r\n- Convert `DimensionRangeBucketShardSpec` to `BuildingSingleDim` or `BuildingDimRange`\r\n   as applicable\r\n- Serialize/deserialize `PartitionBoundaries` as an array of Strings instead of an array of `StringTuples`\r\n   for single dimension use cases (i.e. when each boundary is either null or is a tuple of size 1)\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- Tested behaviour of single_dim on local cluster with a micro quickstart cluster on old version\r\n   and a separate middle manager on new version (with multi dim)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nFollowing up on discussion in #11853, this PR introduces a new `TypeStrategy` interface which defines binary serde and comparison for values of any `TypeSignature`.\r\n\r\nThe binary serialization methods were consolidated from the static methods in `Types`, and the code I think is overall much more simple.\r\n\r\n`TypeStrategy` deals in objects, so is not optimal for primitive values like longs and doubles, so the static methods for reading/writing these values with nulls remain but now live in `TypeStrategies`, along with all of the built-in implementations (string, long, double, float, array).\r\n\r\nThe comparator implementations match the orderings defined in `druid-processing`... we may wish to consider bringing some of them into `druid-core`, merging `druid-core` and `druid-processing` :trollface: , or something else to try to consolidate things a bit better. The array comparator behaves mostly the same as postgres array comparison afaict, with the exception that we default to \"nulls first\" for most thing rather than \"nulls last\" so we do that instead.\r\n\r\n`ObjectByteStrategy` is moved back into `ObjectStrategy`, it's registry replaced with one of `TypeStrategy`, and instead `ComplexMetricsSerde` has a new default implementation of a method called `getTypeStrategy` which wraps the `ObjectStrategy` methods, but could be overridden for more optimal implementations.\r\n\r\nI think the utility of being able to get binary serde to use for things like buffer aggregators is on full display in the `ExprEval` serialization methods, so I think overall i'm in favor of this change, since basically anywhere you have a ` ColumnInspector` (which includes `RowSignature`) you have the means to read, write, and compare values.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `TypeStrategy`\r\n * `TypeStrategies`\r\n * `Types`\r\n * `NullableTypeStrategy`\r\n * `ComplexMetricsSerde`\r\n * `ColumnType`\r\n * `ColumnTypeFactory`\r\n * `ExpressionType`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n#11650 missed adding JSON type info for `ListFilteredVirtualColumn`, which results in failure when actually trying to use it. This was my bad - it had serde tests, but not serde as a part of a query, so there was a blind spot.\r\n\r\nI've added a JSON serialization round trip as part of validation in `BaseCalciteQueryTest` to try to prevent this from happening again.\r\n\r\nI suspect that not everything on every query implements `equals` fully, because directly comparing the round-tripped serialized query against the expected query resulted in a failure, but comparing the string of the round tripped query against the string of the expected query does seem to pass, so went with that for now. All of the `MV_FILTER_*` tests failed prior to this change, so it should at least help.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

changes:\r\n\r\n- Add `void mkdirp(File directory) throws IOException` to FileUtils, which has semantics like Unix `mkdir -p`. It creates a directory if it does not exist, returns quietly if it already exists, and generates an error if it could not be created.\r\n- Migrate usages of File.mkdirs to the new function and add File.mkdirs to the forbidden functions list.\r\n\r\nThe new method is better for two reasons:\r\n\r\nFirst, File.mkdirs makes it easy to ignore errors, since it returns a boolean. Unchecked usage is common and leads to confusing errors later, like \"Cannot create file [dir/file]\", instead of more-specific errors upfront like \"Cannot create directory [dir]\".\r\n\r\nSecond, File.mkdirs is not concurrency safe. \"Natural\" patterns like this with File.mkdirs are prone to race conditions, because two `dir.mkdirs()` that run concurrently cannot both succeed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (!dir.exists() && !dir.mkdirs()) {\r\n  throw new IOException();\r\n}\r\n```","created_at":"2021-11-05T14:26:25Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T07:40:02Z","closed_at":"2021-11-09T19:10:49Z","merged_at":"2021-11-09T19:10:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"babf00f8e3a368e44afdd3eddf7356dad36a67b1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":782100314,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODIxMDAzMTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Refactoring","name":"Refactoring","color":"d1ea7e","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/45","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/45","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/45/labels","id":7818158,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Ad0uu","number":45,"title":"0.23.0","description":"Druid

Description\r\nFollow-up to #11829, this modifies `DimensionHandler` to allow defining a `DimensionSpec` appropriate for the type of dimension being handled, which is now used `DictionaryEncodedColumnIndexer.makeColumnValueSelector`, so that more type appropriate column selectors can be created.\r\n\r\nI also renamed `BitmapIndexColumnPartSupplier` to `StringBitmapIndexColumnPartSupplier` since it currently only works for string dictionary encoded columns (instead of making it generic and introducing additional virtual call-sites)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DimensionHandler`\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes typos in the docker build script in case the Hadoop 3 profile is selected . \r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\n\r\nEnhanced the `ExtractionNamespace` interface in `lookups-cached-global` core extension with the ability to set a `maxHeapPercentage` for the cache of the respective namespace. The reason for adding this functionality, is make it easier to detect when a lookup table grows to a size that the underlying service cannot handle, because it does not have enough memory. The default value of maxHeap for the interface is -1, which indicates that no maxHeapPercentage has been set. For the `JdbcExtractionNamespace` and `UriExtractionNamespace` implementations, the default value is null, which will cause the respective service that the lookup is loaded in, to warn when its cache is beyond `mxHeapPercentage` of the service's configured max heap size. If a positive non-null value is set for the namespace's `maxHeapPercentage` config, this value will be honored for all services that the respective lookup is loaded onto, and consequently log warning messages when the cache of the respective lookup grows beyond this respective percentage of the services configured max heap size.  Warnings are logged every time that either Uri based or Jdbc based lookups are regenerated, if the `maxHeapPercentage` constraint is violated. No other implementations will log warnings at this time. No error is thrown when the size exceeds the maxHeapPercentage at this time, as doing so could break functionality for existing users. Previously the `JdbcCacheGenerator` generated its cache by materializing all rows of the underling table in memory at once; this made it difficult to log warning messages in the case that the results from the jdbc query were very large and caused the service to run out of memory. To help with this, this pr makes it so that the jdbc query results are instead streamed through an iterator.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

incompatibility was encountered while executing org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-assembly-plugin:2.6:single: java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError: null`\r\n\r\nFixed the bug by upgrading maven-assembly-plugin to the latest (3.2.0)\r\n\r\nAlso made a fix to license generation python scripts where newer version of pyyaml's load_all requires Loader to be specified. \r\n\r\n<!-- Check the

Description\r\nThis PR adds support for Druid \"complex\" types to the native expression processing system, made possible after the type system enhancements done in #11713. The implications of this are that now it will be possible for _all_ Druid data to be usable within expressions, should expressions be added to handle these types.\r\n\r\n`ObjectBinding`, the non-vectorized expression input data provider, now implements `ColumnInspector` so that it can retain type information when available, and a new constant, `ComplexExpr` has been added which accepts the `ExpressionType` alongside the value to represent these values provided by the binding.\r\n\r\nSeveral generic nullable value binary serde methods for types have been moved out of `ExprEval` and into `Types`, to hopefully be more generally available for writing nullable values that follow the `| null (byte) | value (byte[]) |` pattern, which is now all of the `ExprEval` types. I've adusted the binary formats slightly to be more consistent, so there are some minor changes to the expression buffer aggregator, but this should have no compatibility issues because this format is not written to segments anywhere, and contained within processing of a single node.\r\n\r\nA base interface has been extracted from `ObjectStrategy` in `druid-processing`, which is called `ObjectByteStrategy` because naming is hard and lives in `druid-core`, to provide conversion between object and binary format for complex types. A registry of these `ObjectByteStrategy` to type name has been added to hold these, and registering a `ComplexMetricsSerde` in `ComplexMetrics` will automatically register its `ObjectStrategy` in the lower level `ObjectByteStrategy` registry. This would be less messy if `druid-core` and `druid-processing` were just merged since the `ComplexMetrics` registry could just be used directly for binary serialization of expressions, but.. they are not yet.\r\n\r\nTo showcase the new complex expressions, I have added 4 new 'hyperUnique' functions, and 3 new bloom filter expressions to the `druid-bloom-filter` extension:\r\n* `hyper_unique()` - creates a druid built-in `HyperLogLogCollector`\r\n* `hyper_unique_add(expr1, expr2)` - adds `expr1` to hyper-log-log collector `expr2`\r\n* `hyper_unique_estimate(expr)` - get double estimate for hyper-log-log collector `expr`\r\n* `hyper_unique_round_estimate(expr)` - get estimate rounded to a long value for hyper-log-log collector `expr`\r\n* `bloom_filter(expr)` - creates a bloom filter with expected capacity `expr`\r\n* `bloom_filter_test(expr1, expr2)` - checks if `expr1` is contained in the bloom filter `expr2`\r\n* `bloom_filter_add(expr1, expr2)` - adds `expr1` to bloom filter `expr2`.\r\n\r\nTo allow complex expressions to be defined as literals, I've also added `complex_decode_base64(expr1,expr2)`, where `expr1` must be a string literal with a valid complex type name, and `expr2` a base64 encoded string that is a serialized value of that type (or null if the row is null).\r\n\r\nI have not documented any these yet, because I'm still considering how to position them, and there are several parts of the expression system which are still missing documentation for the same reason like the native expression aggregator. I have also not wired these up to SQL functions yet for similar reasons.\r\n\r\nWith these expressions, it is possible for example to even re-create the native bloom filter aggregator - instead using the expression aggregator:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"expression\",\r\n      \"name\": \"bloom_expression\",\r\n      \"fields\": [\"user\"],\r\n      \"initialValue\": \"bloom_filter(10000)\",\r\n      \"fold\": \"bloom_filter_add(user, __acc)\",\r\n      \"maxSizeBytes\": 8096\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut I think this is just scratching the surface of what this change will make possible.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1413\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-09-25 at 4 52 31 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/139329494-ba3f3f28-06f2-498f-b42a-1b32054ec622.png\">\r\n\r\n### Arrays\r\nBecause of multi-value string transformation magic, that automatically translates expressions for selectors into `map` and for the expression aggregator into `fold`, it was necessary to support arrays of complex types. I have reworked the code of arrays to collapse all of `LongArrayExpr`, `DoubleArrayExpr`, and `StringArrayExpr` into a single consolidated `ArrayExpr`,  and likewise collapsed the array `ExprEval` implementations into a single `ArrayExprEval`. This significantly simplifies a lot of the array handling code, opened the door to allow arrays of complex types, and interestingly, also *nested array types*! \r\n\r\nI have gated nested arrays behind a new feature flag, set in runtime properties with `druid.expressions.allowNestedArrays`, which defaults to disabled. I think it would be better to hold off on opening this up until we support proper grouping on arrays and drop a lot of the automatic `STRING` coercion that is currently happening.\r\n\r\nI have added some tests with the functionality enabled though, since it is mostly at the selector and above layers that we don't fully handle array types.\r\n\r\nThe parser doesn't directly understand a nested array literal, so the `array` function must be used to construct nested arrays, e.g. `[['a', 'b', 'c'],['d', 'e']]` will not parse correctly, but `array(['a', 'b', 'c'],['d', 'e'])` will.\r\n\r\nEmpty arrays can be defined directly as literals, as I have added parser support for the full `ExpressionType` string representation, e.g. `ARRAY<ARRAY<LONG>>[]` is an empty nested array of long literal. This syntax also works for non-nested arrays and complex arrays, `ARRAY<COMPLEX<hyperUnique>>[]`, etc.\r\n\r\n### Type stuffs\r\nAlong the way i've further improved the quality of `RowSignature` available when processing queries, here mostly for `IncrementalIndex` column selector factories, which were previously making a `RowBasedColumnSelectorFactory` with an empty `RowSignature`, and now will be created with the latest `RowSignature` available in the form of a supplier. `RowBasedColumnSelectorFactory` accepts this supplier instead of a direct `RowSignature`, since the schema might change during the lifetime of an incremental index.\r\n\r\nI have also enriched the non-vectorized expression type information available, by changing `Expr.ObjectBinding` to also implement `InputBindingInspector`, which requires it define a `getType` method. I have transitioned most uses of `ExprEval.bestEffortOf` to now use `ExprEval.ofType` instead, which will fall back to best effort if the type is null.\r\n\r\n### Future work\r\nImplementing additional expressions for other complex type extensions, such as data sketches, etc.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `Expr` \r\n * `ConstantExpr`\r\n * `ArrayExpr`\r\n * `ExprEval`\r\n * `Types`\r\n * `ObjectStrategy`\r\n * `IncrementalIndex`\r\n * `RowBasedColumnSelectorFactory`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.
