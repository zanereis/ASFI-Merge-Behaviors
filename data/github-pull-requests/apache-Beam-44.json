#28061 \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a warning log, if the `process` method of `DoFn` returns `None` by checking the following cases (doesn't check inner functions):\r\n\r\n- `process` contains `return None` (explicit `return None`)\r\n- `process` contains only `return` (implicit `return None`)\r\n- `process` doesn't contain `yield` neither does it contain `return` (implicit `return None`)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

[github.com/tetratelabs/wazero](https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero) from 1.4.0 to 1.5.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/releases\">github.com/tetratelabs/wazero's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.5.0</h2>\n<p>Hey, do you know what time is it? ⏰ Yes! Time for another wazero release! 🎉</p>\n<p>Notably, as <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/releases/tag/v1.4.0\">previously announced</a>, this release drops support to Go 1.18. But you must be here for the goodies: don't you worry, we have you covered: there's a whole lot of updates especially for you Emscripten fanatics!</p>\n<p>Time flies when you are having fun: <a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/wasmcon/\">WasmCon 2023 is only a few days away (5-6 September)</a>. Remember, our very own <a href=\"https://github.com/evacchi\"><code>@​evacchi</code></a> will be there to talk about wazero, so if you are going to be there, don't be shy and say hi!</p>\n<h2>Improved Emscripten support</h2>\n<p>Contributor <a href=\"https://github.com/jerbob92\"><code>@​jerbob92</code></a> together with <a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a> brought quite some improvements to our Emscripten support.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is now improved support to <code>longjmp</code>, especially useful to exception handling (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/pull/1611\">tetratelabs/wazero#1611</a>).</li>\n<li>We are now allowing a host function to make a nested invocation to another host function (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/1626\">#1626</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/1636\">#1636</a>).</li>\n<li>We are exposing some new experimental APIs (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/pull/1637\">tetratelabs/wazero#1637</a>) to support a go implementation of <a href=\"https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/connecting_cpp_and_javascript/embind.html\">Emscripten's Embind</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What is Embind? In <a href=\"https://github.com/jerbob92\"><code>@​jerbob92</code></a>'s words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Embind allows developers to write C++ code and directly interact with that code from Javascript in the browser. It also allows to call Javascript methods directly from C++. [...] [The Wazero implementation] is trying to be a 1-on-1 implementation of the JS version in Emscripten so that the same codebase can be used for both Web and WASI WebAssembly builds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Embind support lives in its own module and you can check it out at <a href=\"https://github.com/jerbob92/wazero-emscripten-embind\">jerbob92/wazero-emscripten-embind</a>!</p>\n<h2>Go Version Upgrade</h2>\n<p>As you may already know, we follow the Go support policy: i.e., we support each major Go release until there are two newer major releases: in <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/releases/tag/v1.4.0\">v1.4.0</a> we added support to Go 1.21, while keeping support to Go 1.18 for a little while more.

like to get feedback on this approach. Marking the MR as draft because more tests would need to be added and I haven't run existing tests yet, either.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this change is to get exceptions caught and re-raised [here](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/26b77723445cf383365098b296b9db77409af94c/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/bigquery_tools.py#L732-L740) to output rows to failed_rows rather than just causing a pipeline error. Outputting to failed_rows tag is necessary to avoid streaming pipelines that infinitely retry messages that result in these pipeline errors.\r\n\r\nThese exceptions cause infinite retries because [this self.bigquery_wrapper.insert_rows call](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/26b77723445cf383365098b296b9db77409af94c/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/bigquery.py#L1635-L1643) ends up raising an exception rather than returning errors due to the exception raised by [self.gcp_bq_client.insert_rows_json](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/26b77723445cf383365098b296b9db77409af94c/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/bigquery_tools.py#L720) that prevents the errors list from being instantiated. The exception will bubble up (raised [here](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/26b77723445cf383365098b296b9db77409af94c/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/bigquery_tools.py#L732-L740)) to the [_flush_batch method](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/26b77723445cf383365098b296b9db77409af94c/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/bigquery.py#L1645-L1653) where it is unhandled and will produce a pipeline error.\r\n\r\nGetting those rows to the failed_rows tag may require doing some things that may or may not be acceptable:\r\n\r\n- The exception has to be packaged up with the required fields\r\n- A reason has to be assigned to these errors. I went with 'invalid' to make sure that these types of errors are not retried\r\n- All rows in a batch are output to the failed_rows tag. Looking back at this comment on [BEAM-12362](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12362?focusedCommentId=17347262&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-17347262), I think the original intent of [raising these exceptions](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/26b77723445cf383365098b296b9db77409af94c/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/bigquery_tools.py#L732-L740) was to get the rows into the failed_rows tag and it seems likely that most/all rows in a batch would be affected by the types of exceptions being caught there.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Description\r\n\r\nWhen running the `FlinkPortableClientEntryPoint`, we should be able to pass some arguments that the `JobServerDriver` can handle (because `FlinkPortableClientEntryPoint` is starting the job server driver).\r\n\r\nActually, I can see there is other todo in the JobServer like handle the filesystem arguments ? \r\n\r\nMy hope is to make an other PR, that add those filesystem arguments in `FlinkPortableClientEntryPoint` and the `JobServerDriver` (for example be able to set `minioURL`, etc instead of using s3 in some case etc)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nSee the

the current implementation of file sources, the Flink runner will try to fix the size of input splits using the formula `source estimated size / parallelism`. Most of the time, the resulting desired split size will be much larger than the size of files read by this source.  In that case each individual file becomes full split, and the number of splits is larger than parallelism. \r\n\r\nThis creates an issue when the size of individual files varies a lot. At Spotify we commonly read datasets stored on GCS where individual files range from a few Mb to 1 or 2 Gb. Because of this, work distribution is sub-optimal because some workers will be consuming larges splits while other worker consume smaller splits.  \r\n\r\nThis PR limits the maximum size of each split to 128Mb (configurable), which is a decent tradeoff between balancing work and limiting the overhead of consuming splits. I believe Dataflow uses the same strategy.\r\n\r\nIn our test on real workflows, we measured an **improvement in execution time (and therefore resource consumption) of up to 20%**. Of course the overall improvement varies a lot from one workflow to another, but we never encountered a case where performances where noticeably degraded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
