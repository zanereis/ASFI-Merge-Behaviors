Take a snapshot of a volume (this creates a references for primary storage and secondary storage in snapshot_store_ref table\n- Simulate retiring primary data storage where snapshot is cached (in this

Actual behaviour\n\nCloudStack doesn't support changing service offering for vm instances which have vm snapshots, they should be removed before changing service offering.\n## Goal\n\nExtend actual behaviour by supporting changing service offering for vms which have vm snapshots. In that case, previously taken snapshots (if reverted) should use previous service offering, future snapshots should use the newest.\n## Proposed solution:\n1. Adding `service_offering_id` column on `vm_snapshots` table: This way snapshot can be reverted to original state even though service offering can be changed for vm instance.\n   NOTE: Existing vm snapshots are populated on update script by:\n   `UPDATE vm_snapshots s JOIN vm_instance v ON v.id = s.vm_id SET s.service_offering_id = v.service_offering_id;`\n2. New vm snapshots will use instance vm service offering id as `service_offering_id`\n3. Revert to vm snapshots should use vm snapshot's `service_offering_id` value.\n## Example use case:\n- Deploy vm using service offering A\n- Take vm snapshot -> snap1 (service offering A)\n- Stop vm\n- Change vm service offering to B\n- Revert to VM snapshot snap 1\n- Start vm\n\nIt is expected that vm has service offering A after last step\n","created_at":"2016-10-24T16:05:29Z","updated_at":"2020-04-06T14:54:38Z","closed_at":"2017-02-17T06:39:04Z","merged_at":"2017-02-17T06:39:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"3a6d98289cfd139f9f2a520e231253ec8ddb9f11","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1727/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1727/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1727/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/3a6d98289cfd139f9f2a520e231253ec8ddb9f11","head":{"label":"nvazquez:change-serv-offering","ref":"change-serv-offering","sha":"3a6d98289cfd139f9f2a520e231253ec8ddb9f11","user":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40547252,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDU0NzI1Mg==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"nvazquez/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

watchdog timer adds functionality where the Hypervisor can detect if an\ninstance has crashed or stopped functioning.\n\nWhen the Instance has the 'watchdog' daemon running it will send heartbeats\nto the /dev/watchdog device.\n\nIf these heartbeats are no longer received by the HV it will reset the Instance.\n\nIf the Instance never sends the heartbeats the HV does not take action. It only\ntakes action if it stops sending heartbeats.\n\nThis is supported since Libvirt 0.7.3 and can be defined in the XML format as\ndescribed in the docs: https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsWatchdog\n\nTo the 'devices' section this will be added:\n\n  <watchdog model='i6300esb' action='reset'/>\n\nIn the agent.properties the action to be taken can be defined:\n\n  vm.watchdog.action=reset\n\nThe same goes for the model.

hosts on shared storage failure was accepted by mgmt server with the\nhost state as Up, even though there was no primary/shared storage available on\nit. This patch offers a quick fix by throwing an exception in the storage monitor\nwhich connects storage pool on host. The failure is trapped by agent manager\nthat disconnects the agent without any investigation.\n\nBased on Lab tests, KVM agent may take upto 2 minutes to attempt NFS mount when\nthe storage is inaccessible (firewalled, or shutdown) before returning back with\nan error. It is safe to assume that this won't add pressure on mgmt server due to\nseveral reconnection attempts, and KVM agent would retry reconnection every 2\nminutes.\n\nFor such KVM hosts, where failure happens due to storage issues; they will be\nbriefly put in Alert state but will be mostly be in Connecting state during which\nthe KVM host attempts to mount/reconfigure NFS storage pool.\n\n/cc @jburwell @karuturi \n@blueorangutan package\n","created_at":"2016-09-27T07:50:18Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T13:16:53Z","closed_at":"2016-11-02T17:28:35Z","merged_at":"2016-11-02T17:28:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"32a397aa9357c409de7561a8c68a469c3bf3c52a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1694/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1694/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1694/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/32a397aa9357c409de7561a8c68a469c3bf3c52a","head":{"label":"shapeblue:kvm-no-storage-failfast","ref":"kvm-no-storage-failfast","sha":"32a397aa9357c409de7561a8c68a469c3bf3c52a","user":{"login":"shapeblue","id":6001764,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYwMDE3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6001764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue","html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35481491,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTQ4MTQ5MQ==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"shapeblue/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shapeblue","id":6001764,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYwMDE3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6001764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue","html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue/cloudstack","description":"The upstream repository is at http://github.com/apache/cloudstack.

PR adds support for cross-cluster storage migration of VMs that make use of managed storage with XenServer.\n\nManaged storage is when you have a 1:1 mapping between a virtual disk and a volume on a SAN (in the case of XenServer, an SR is placed on this SAN volume and a single virtual disk placed in the SR).\n\nManaged storage allows features such as storage QoS and SAN-side snapshots to work (sort of analogous to VMware VVols).\n\nThis PR focuses on enabling VMs that are using managed storage to be migrated across XenServer clusters.\n\nI have successfully run the following tests on this branch:\n\nTestVolumes.py\nTestSnapshots.py\nTestVMSnapshots.py\nTestAddRemoveHosts.py\nTestVMMigrationWithStorage.py (which is a new test that is being added with this PR)\n","created_at":"2016-09-02T21:58:15Z","updated_at":"2016-09-13T12:11:35Z","closed_at":"2016-09-13T12:11:35Z","merged_at":"2016-09-13T12:11:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"b508fb8692eac1675a4597c9dfaef463304aecba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1671/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1671/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1671/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/b508fb8692eac1675a4597c9dfaef463304aecba","head":{"label":"mike-tutkowski:copy-vol-migration","ref":"copy-vol-migration","sha":"b508fb8692eac1675a4597c9dfaef463304aecba","user":{"login":"mike-tutkowski","id":3019295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTkyOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3019295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski","html_url":"https://github.com/mike-tutkowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":15264574,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI2NDU3NA==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"mike-tutkowski/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mike-tutkowski","id":3019295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTkyOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3019295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski","html_url":"https://github.com/mike-tutkowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mike-tutkowski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mike-tutkowski/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

ACS provides the ability to deploy a VM from a template or ISO. However, ACS does not provide the ability to deploy a VM(s) directly from a VM snapshot.\n\nVM snapshots are stored in the primary storage and have a hierarchical or parent/child relationship. The requirement would be to provide the ability to deploy user instances from selected VM snapshots. Additionally, any VM snapshot in the hierarchy can be deployed concurrently.\n\nEven though this can be supported and applicable to all hypervisors, to start with this feature is supported only for VMware hypervisor.\n\nAlso this feature supports creation of volume from VM snapshots. Details of new APIs added as part of this feature can be found in feature specification document below.\n\nFeature specification is at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Deploy+instance+from+VM+snapshot\n\nThere is a separate PR raised by @nitt10prashant  that contains marvin tests for this

Prevent DNS reflection attacks\n\n```\nDNS on VR should not be publically accessible as it may be prone to DNS\namplification/reflection attacks. This fixes the issue by only allowing VR\nDNS (port 53) to be accessible from guest network cidr, as per the fix in:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-6432\n\n- Only allows guest network cidrs to query VR DNS on port 53.\n- Includes marvin smoke test that checks the VR DNS accessibility checks from\n  guest and non-guest network.\n- Fixes Marvin sshClient to avoid using ssh agent when password is provided,\n  previous some environments may have seen 'No existing session' exception without\n  this fix.\n- Adds a new dnspython dependency that is used to perform dns resolutions in the\n  tests.\n```\n\nDue to repository commit issues I've created this PR, based on #1653 .\n\n/cc @jburwell @karuturi @NuxRo @ustcweizhou @wido  and

pointed out in CLOUDSTACK-9339, in case of multiple public IP's from different public IP ranges are associated with VR, VR functionality is broken from 4.6. Below are the brief list of problems specific to non-VPC networks addressed in the PR. This PR handles both VPC and non-VPC scenarios.\n- reverse traffic for the connections accepted on the eth3 and above public interfaces are getting blocked. Need a rule for e.g \"-A FORWARD -i  eth3 -o eth0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\" in the FORWARD chain of filter table to permit reverse path traffic for established connections.\n- outbound public traffic from eth0 to eth3 (or for interfaces above like eth4 eth5 etc) needs rule to run through FW_OUTBOUND chain in the filter table\n- network stats on public interfaces eth3 are getting gathered\n- default gateway is missing in the device specific routing table, resulting in traffic to be looked up in main routing table\n- creating a device specific route table is generating \"from all lookup Table_eth3\" in the\n  ip rules, resulting in rest of the traffic getting blocked.\n\nPicked few commits from #1519 from dsclose (https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1519) submitted for 4.7\n\nMarvin tests are added to test below\n- Static NAT works on the public interfaces above eth2, in case non-vpc networks\n- Portforwarding works on the public interfaces above eth2,

fresh installation, the usage server fails to start if the `key` file does\nnot exist in its classpath.

the 4.1.0-4.2.0 db upgrade path, it creates new tables to store secondary\n(nfs) storage in image_store table and volumes in volume_store_ref table. In\nthe upgrade path, it first tries to migrate NFS storage pool where it excludes\nstorage pools which have been removed, but it migrates all the volumes without\nchecking if their storage pools have been removed. This causes fk constraint\nfailure as the volume/row being inserted refers to a storage pool which does\nnot exist in the image_store table.\n\nThe fix migrates all the nfs storage pools to image_store including removed\nstorage pools and in doing so migrates with the 'removed' field. This fixes\ndb upgrade for old pre-4.0 and 4.0/4.1 CloudStack clouds.\n\n/cc @jburwell @PaulAngus @karuturi @abhinandanprateek @murali-reddy \n","created_at":"2016-08-23T08:03:15Z","updated_at":"2016-08-24T07:32:42Z","closed_at":"2016-08-24T07:32:42Z","merged_at":"2016-08-24T07:32:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"7530f4b6dd98c18bceda3e1bf7790c0689ff5441","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1656/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1656/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1656/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/7530f4b6dd98c18bceda3e1bf7790c0689ff5441","head":{"label":"shapeblue:4.9-fk410to420fix","ref":"4.9-fk410to420fix","sha":"7530f4b6dd98c18bceda3e1bf7790c0689ff5441","user":{"login":"shapeblue","id":6001764,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYwMDE3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6001764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue","html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35481491,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTQ4MTQ5MQ==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"shapeblue/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shapeblue","id":6001764,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYwMDE3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6001764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue","html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue/cloudstack","description":"The upstream repository is at http://github.com/apache/cloudstack.

loaded.\n","created_at":"2016-08-23T07:45:02Z","updated_at":"2017-07-27T11:46:35Z","closed_at":"2017-07-27T11:46:35Z","merged_at":"2017-07-27T11:46:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"6d5c61b7bc6083594d2505a50fec9267d4250a87","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1655/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1655/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1655/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/4be72489e2c4c0e290f6d151506e5019590b24ce","head":{"label":"lygutas:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"4be72489e2c4c0e290f6d151506e5019590b24ce","user":{"login":"lygutas","id":4670539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzA1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4670539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lygutas","html_url":"https://github.com/lygutas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lygutas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lygutas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lygutas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lygutas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lygutas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lygutas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lygutas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lygutas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lygutas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66343525,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjM0MzUyNQ==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"lygutas/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lygutas","id":4670539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzA1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4670539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lygutas","html_url":"https://github.com/lygutas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lygutas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lygutas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lygutas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lygutas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lygutas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lygutas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lygutas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lygutas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lygutas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lygutas/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

patch and security releases do not require schema migrations or\ndata migrations.  However, if an empty upgrade class and associated\nscripts are not defined, the upgrade process will break.  With this\nchange, if a release does not have an upgrade, a noop DbUpgrade is added\nto the upgrade path.  This approach allows the upgrade to proceed and\nfor the database to properly reflect the installed version.  This change\nshould make the release process simpler as RMs no longer need to\nrememeber to create this boilerplate code when starting a new release.\n\nBeginning with the 4.8.2.0 and 4.9.1.0 releases, the project will\nformally adopt a four (4) position release number to properly accomodate\nrekeases that contain only CVE fixes.  The DatabaseUpgradeChecker and\nVersion classes made assumptions that they would always parse and\ncompare three (3) position version numbers.  This change adds the\nCloudStackVersion value object that supports both three (3) and four (4)\nversion numbers.   It encapsulates version comparsion logic, as well as,\nthe rules to allow three (3) and four (4) to interoperate.\n- Modifies DatabaseUpgradeChecker to handle derive an upgrade path for\n  a version that was not explicitly specified.  It determines the\n  releases the first release before it with database migrations and uses\n  that list as the basis for the list for version being calculated.  A\n  noop upgrade is then added to the list which causes no schema changes\n  or data migrations, but will update the database to the version.\n- Adds unit tests for the upgrade path calculation logic in\n  DatabaseUpgradeChecker\n- Removes dummy upgrade logic for the 4.8.2.0 introduced in previous\n  versions of this patch\n- Introduces the CloudStackVersion value object which parses and\n  compares three (3) and four (4) position version numbers.

fix tearDown order in list_acl_ tests\n\n```\nIn several of the list_acl_tests, the tests run for simulator only where\nin the (class) setup domains and accounts are created for the test. When the\ntests end the (class) teardown methods would delete and remove these resources.\nDue to dependence of one of the resources on the other, domain2 on domain1,\ndomain2 needs to be removed/cleaned up before domain1. Due to this issue,\nseveral Travis test runs have failed in the past such as:\n\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cloudstack/jobs/152610967\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/cloudstack/jobs/152610968\n\nChanging the order of cleanup fixes the tests.\n```\n\n/cc @jburwell @karuturi \n\nThe fix is specific to tests that run 'only' on simulator with Travis. A passing Travis run should be enough to validate the changes.\n","created_at":"2016-08-19T11:44:56Z","updated_at":"2016-08-29T06:45:33Z","closed_at":"2016-08-29T06:45:33Z","merged_at":"2016-08-29T06:45:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"157b8147b91733e401ef0be8e2300518822c55e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1648/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1648/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1648/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/157b8147b91733e401ef0be8e2300518822c55e2","head":{"label":"shapeblue:4.9-fixmarvintest","ref":"4.9-fixmarvintest","sha":"157b8147b91733e401ef0be8e2300518822c55e2","user":{"login":"shapeblue","id":6001764,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYwMDE3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6001764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue","html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35481491,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTQ4MTQ5MQ==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"shapeblue/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shapeblue","id":6001764,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYwMDE3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6001764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue","html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue/cloudstack","description":"The upstream repository is at http://github.com/apache/cloudstack.

variables passed to Java when\n  starting up.\n  \n  It also creates a foundation for sharing the systemd service profile\n  between CentOS and Ubuntu since it only requires the environment file\n  to be changed.\n- deb: Add Ubuntu 16.04 support\n  \n  Ubuntu 16.04 differs from Ubuntu 14.04 in a few ways:\n  - systemd instead of sysvinit / upstart\n  - Java 8 support\n  \n  The packaging now detects on which distribution it is being\n  build and based on that it installs different files in the\n  packages, but it also changes the

PR makes it easier to spin up system VMs on managed storage.\n\nManaged storage is when you have a dedicated volume on a SAN for a particular virtual disk (making it easier to deliver QoS).\n\nFor example, with this PR, you'd likely have a single virtual disk for a system VM. On XenServer, that virtual disk resides by itself in a storage repository (no other virtual disks share this storage repository).\n\nIt was possible in the past to spin up system VMs that used managed storage, but this PR facilitates the use case by making changes to the System Service Offering dialog (and by putting in some parameter checks in the management server).\n\nJIRA ticket:
