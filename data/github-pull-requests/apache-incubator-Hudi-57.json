What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nHUDI-3844\r\n\r\nWithout this patch, the indexer presumes only those metadata indexes are enabled which are passed to it in the props.

For completed commits, we are relying on commit metadata to deduce the list of files to be deleted and we have fs.listStatus in one of the places. But there are chances, that a commit is cleaned up by the cleaner and hence no data files exists. So, fixing this to do exists check to ensure we can ignore non existant files to be rolledback. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fixed list based rollback strategy to ignore non existant data files while deducing list of files to delete for a complete commit. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- TestHoodieSparkMergeOnReadTableRollback.testRestoreWithCleanedUpCommits\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is

purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nCurrently, Data Skipping is not handling correctly the case when column-stats are not aligned and, for ex, some of the (column, file) combinations are missing from the CSI.\r\n\r\n This could occur in different scenarios (schema evolution, CSI config changes), and has to be handled properly when we're composing CSI projection for Data Skipping. This PR addresses that.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n -  Added appropriate aligning for the transposed CSI projection\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- In Deltastreamer, we re-instantiate WriteClient whenever schema changes. Same write client is used by all async table services as well. This poses an issue, because the new write client when re-instantiated is intimated to the async table service. but if the async table service is in the middle of compaction, uses a local copy of write client. and hence may not be able to reach the timeline server and will run into connection issues. We are fixing this in this patch. \r\n- We have a singleton instance of embedded timeline service which regular writers and all table services will use. And within async table services, we will listen to write config changes and re-instantiate write client before any new compaction execution. \r\n- Even between multiple re-instantiations of write clients for regular writer (due to schema change), uses the same singleton embedded timeline server. \r\n- Previously embedded timeline server was shutdown when write client was shutdown. Fixed that in this patch, so that a single instantiation and tear down of embedded timeline server will span entire process start and stop. \r\n- This also fixes a long standing issue w/ spark structured streaming. Apparently, this is what is happening in spark structured streaming flow. We start a new write client during first batch and close it at the end. But keep re-using the same instance of writeClient for subsequent batches. Only core entity that is impacted here was the embedded timeline server since we were closing it when write client was closed. So, after batch1, if timeline server was enabled, pipeline will fail since timeline server is shutdown. So, in this patch we are fixing that as well. Embedded timeline server is externally instantiated and so writeClient.close() will not shutdown the timeline server. We have a singleton instance of timeline server through entire pipeline. Previously we hard coded DIRECT style markers for spark streaming, but after this patch, we should be able to relax that. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fixed Deltastreamer and Spark streaking sink to ensure timeline server sustains multiple instantiations of write client by different wriiters. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a job locally.*\r\n  - For structured streaming, existing tests cover all flows. \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new config to control the use and reading of metadata index in HoodieBloomIndex, separate from the existing write configs, e.g., `hoodie.metadata.index.column.stats.enable`, which control the writing of the index in metadata table.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Adds new config `hoodie.bloom.index.use.metadata` to control the use of index from metadata table in HoodieBloomIndex.  When true, the index lookup uses bloom filters and column stats from metadata table when available to speed up the process.\r\n- Replaces the control knobs with the new config for reading metadata index on the write path.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR

purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nFixing performance hits in reading Column Stats Index:\r\n\r\n1. [HUDI-3834] There's substantial performance degradation in Avro 1.10 default generated `Builder` classes: they by default rely on `SpecificData.getForSchema` that load corresponding model's class using reflection, which takes a hit when executed on the hot-path (this was bringing overall runtime to read full Column Stats Index of 800k records to **60s**, whereas now it's taking mere **3s**)\r\n\r\n2. Addressing memory churn by over-used Hadoop's `Path` creation: `Path` ctor is not a lightweight sequence and produces quite a bit of memory churn adding pressure on GC. Cleaning such avoidable allocations up to make sure there's no unnecessarily added pressure on GC.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIn Local and hdfs file schemes, there could be partial files created, where in the commit meta files could be empty. We put in a fix sometime back to delete these entries during archival as it will hinder the archival and will fail the pipeline. But we wanted to maintain the entry for book keeping purposes. So, in this patch, we are not deleting such instances, but creating an instant w/o any plan and serializing it to archived folder.

purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nFixing non-partitioned table Partition Records persistence in MT.\r\n\r\nRight now for non-partitioned table both \"\" (empty) and \".\" will be persisted as corresponding partitions, which is incorrect. Instead we make sure that we always map factual partition path (empty) into a _partition-id_ (\".\") before persisting it to MT.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nCheck out above\r\n\r\n## Verify this

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThe Hive sync fails with `ClassNotFoundException` on a Hudi table if metadata table is enabled on the read path, because `hudi-hive-sync-bundle` does not package HBase classes which are needed for reading metadata table.  This PR fixes `hudi-hive-sync-bundle` to include HBase dependencies and shading.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - Adds changes related to HBase dependencies and shading to `pom.xml` of`hudi-hive-sync-bundle`, similar to changes to other bundles in #5004.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing IT tests.  The PR is also verified by running the hive sync with hudi-hive-sync-bundle jar in the docker demo setup.  The hive sync finishes successfully.  From the logs, metadata table files partition can be read without problem after this change, with `DEFAULT_METADATA_ENABLE_FOR_READERS` flipped to `true` in `HoodieMetadataConfig`.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWhen the `instant_time.rollback.requested` file in the timeline is empty or corrupted, it cannot be parsed.  When running `getPendingRollbackInfos()`, it's going to skip that empty/corrupted requested rollback instant and the rollback instant is going to stay on the timeline forever, preventing metadata table archival.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the problem by deleting the requested rollback plan if it is empty or corrupted.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Adds logic to delete requested rollback plan if it cannot be parsed in `BaseHoodieWriteClient::getPendingRollbackInfos()`.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests for requested rollbacks, either valid or corrupted, in `TestClientRollback`.  The fix is also verified by running the deltastreamer on a Hudi Table with corrupted requested rollback in the timeline.  The corrupted rollback plan is deleted afterwards.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nA Hudi file slice may contain uncommitted log files, e.g., from `AbstractTableFileSystemView::getLatestFileSlices` API.  When the file system view is based on the file system, uncommitted log files are included for constructing Hudi file slices.  When the file system view is based on metadata table, uncommitted log files are excluded.  Such behavior difference does not cause any correctness issue as the compaction and clustering planning using `getLatestFileSlices()` skips the uncommitted log files when doing log block reading and merging.  However, such behavior causes the metadata table validator to fail.\r\n\r\nTo fix the problem, this PR adds the logic to exclude uncommitted log files when comparing two file slices with the same base file, if there is no equality.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Adds logic to exclude uncommitted log files when checking equality of two file slices in `HoodieMetadataTableValidator`\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nA Hudi MOR table is constructed where there is an inflight deltacommit with written but uncommitted log files.  Without this PR, `HoodieMetadataTableValidator` fails with `--validate-latest-file-slices` because of uncommitted log files.  After this PR, `HoodieMetadataTableValidator` succeeds with warning messages about uncommitted log files.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- During compaction, updates are present in logs, where as those records that are not updated are in base files. With compaction and preserving commit metadata, we did fix the code path for records that are updated, but those from previous base files were not fixed for file names. Infact, we had this inconsistency even before adding support for preserve commit metadata. i.e. with 0.9.0, after compaction, some records will have meta fields untouched (from previous base file), but those from logs will have all meta files re-written. We are fixing that w/ this patch.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fixing HoodieMergeHandle to fix preserve commit metadata for untouched records from previous base file.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nFix HUDI-3782\r\n\r\nNow that we have table configs for inflight and completed metadata partitions, and given that both reader and writer are going to rely on this config, we need to ensure that this config is updated properly even when any one of the metadata indexes is enabled/disabled.\r\n\r\nFor instance, let's say user started with metadata enabled and colstats enabed. Colstats partition was fully built and the table config got updated. Now, they disable it and we miss to update table config. So the writers won't update the colstats partition and it would be out of sync. Readers think that the table config has it so it's already in sync but that's incorrect. This patch fixes this issue.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Determine whether there is a need to delete MDT partition if any index config is disabled.\r\n- Determine whether there is a need to re-index any MDT partition. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nAdded a unti test which first writes with colstats enabled, then disabled (btu metadata enabled), and then re-enabled.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nCurrently, BloomIndex tries to rely solely on Column Stats to lookup records locations. This is however incorrect, since CS state might not be complete at any given moment; instead we should use it on the basis of best effort (not assuming that it would have any record at all), and for those files that are not found in ColStats we should list from them directly.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nBefore this change, `hoodie.bloom.index.parallelism` is used as the parallelism for generating bloom filter index in metadata table.  Since the default value of the config is 0, when generating the metadata bloom filter records, the method below always uses parallelism as 1, which does not work well for large batch ingestion.  The reason why it has default of 0 is that in the non-metadata-table bloom filter flow, the parallelism can be automatically figured out based on the shuffle parallelism.\r\n\r\n`HoodieTableMetadataUtil.convertMetadataToBloomFilterRecords()`:\r\n```\r\nfinal int parallelism = Math.max(Math.min(allWriteStats.size(), recordsGenerationParams.getBloomIndexParallelism()), 1);\r\nHoodieData<HoodieWriteStat> allWriteStatsRDD = context.parallelize(allWriteStats, parallelism);\r\nreturn allWriteStatsRDD.flatMap(hoodieWriteStat -> {<bloom filter records>})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a separate parallelism config, `hoodie.metadata.index.bloom.filter.parallelism`, for generating bloom filter index in metadata table, since the shuffle parallelism cannot be infered here.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Adds `hoodie.metadata.index.bloom.filter.parallelism` config and passes that to the `MetadataRecordsGenerationParams`\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR is verified by running a Deltastreamer ingesting 10GB data with bulk insert, with bloom filter partition enabled in metadata table.  Without this change, the job cannot finish due to OOM.  With this change, from the Spark UI, there's parallelism when generating bloom filter records in the metadata table and the job succeeds. \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWhen the write client disables metadata table, the metadata table becomes out-of-sync after new commits.  This PR adds the logic to delete the metadata table when the write client disables metadata table updates.  The new deletion logic is only invoked if `hoodie.metadata.enable` in write config is false, and `hoodie.table.metadata.partitions` is either absent or non-empty, indicating that the metadata table might exist.  Note that the user should wait for the metadata table to be fully deleted before re-enabling metadata table on the write side.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Adds logic in `HoodieTable` for deleting metadata table\r\n  - Invokes the metadata table deletion upon getting metadata writer when metadata table is disabled.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change adds new tests in TestHoodieBackedMetadata to validate the flow of disabling and re-enabling metadata table.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-31T09:48:35Z","updated_at":"2022-04-02T11:01:06Z","closed_at":"2022-04-02T11:01:06Z","merged_at":"2022-04-02T11:01:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"020786a5f9d25bf140decf24d65e07dd738e4f9d","assignee":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/5186/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/5186/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/5186/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/9aa5907f19bc0a023ee881f013c03f7abcf3bcf7","head":{"label":"zhangyue19921010:HUDI-3451","ref":"HUDI-3451","sha":"9aa5907f19bc0a023ee881f013c03f7abcf3bcf7","user":{"login":"zhangyue19921010","id":69956021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTU2MDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69956021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangyue19921010","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":361340736,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjEzNDA3MzY=","name":"hudi","full_name":"zhangyue19921010/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhangyue19921010","id":69956021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTU2MDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69956021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangyue19921010","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAfter saw a comment on https://github.com/apache/hudi/commit/f2a93ead3b5a6964a72b3543ada58aa334edef9c#r69671705 regarding the closable and autoClosable, I went back to check the code. We use https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ef8fb9b9d84b6adfe5a4e03b6e775e709d624144/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/parquet/ParquetFileFormat.scala#L200 which returns an iterator and not an instance of Closable or AutoClosable. But guarding it using AutoClosable. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nPartition metadata files are stored in each partition to help identify the base path of a table. These files are saved in the properties file format. Some query engines do not work when non Parquet/ORC files are found in a partition.\r\n\r\nAdded a new table config 'hoodie.partition.metafile.use.data.format' which when enabled (default false for backward compatibility) ensures that partition metafiles will be saved in the same format as the base files of a dataset.\r\n\r\nFor new datasets, the config can be set via hudi-cli. Deltastreamer has a new parameter --partition-metafile-use-data-format which will create a table with this setting.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. New table config 'hoodie.partition.metafile.use.data.format\r\n2. New argument for HoodieDeltaStreamer --partition-metafile-use-data-format \r\n3. Unit tests for table path utils\r\n4.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWhen we build hudi-utilities-bundle, the Spark profile can affect the bundle jar.  This causes incompatibility between hudi-utilities-bundle and some Spark versions due to ClassNotFoundException of our internal adapters.  To address this issue, besides the current hudi-utilities-bundle we generate (`hudi-utilities-bundle_2.11`, `hudi-utilities-bundle_2.12`), we add two new bundles, named as `hudi-utilities-slim-bundle_2.11` and `hudi-utilities-slim-bundle_2.12`, which are intended to be used with Hudi Spark bundle together, if using `hudi-utilities-bundle` solely introduces problems.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Adds `packaging/hudi-utilities-slim-bundle` and pom (copied from `packaging/hudi-utilities-bundle`), to make the hudi-spark-datasource modules `provided` scope so these modules are excluded from the bundle.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\nFor each Spark minor version (Spark 2.4.4 for 2.4, Spark 3.1.3 for 3.1, Spark 3.2.1 for 3.2), run the Deltastreamer using spark-submit, writing to COW and MOR tables, and validate two scenarios, one using `hudi-utilities-bundle` only, and the other using `hudi-utilities-slim-bundle` and corresponding `hudi-spark-bundle`.  For example:\r\n- One bundle scenario:\r\n```\r\nexport SPARK_HOME=/path/to/lib/spark-3.2.1-bin-hadoop3.2\r\nspark-3.2.1-bin-hadoop3.2/bin/spark-submit \\\r\n        --master local[3] \\\r\n
