What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently we can't encoder top level null object into internal row, it throws NPE in 1.6 and returns incorrect result in 2.0.\n\nThe root cause is: Spark SQL doesn't allow row to be null, only its columns can be null. This is different from objects, object itself can be null, and its fields can also be null.\n\nThis is not a problem before, as we assume the input object is never null. However, for outer join, we do need the semantic of null object.\n\nThis PR tries to resolve this fundamental problem by adding a hidden column when serialize object to row, to indicate if the object is null or not.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting test and new test in `DatasetSuite`\n\nTODO: add more comments, code cleanup\n","created_at":"2016-05-26T07:11:53Z","updated_at":"2016-05-31T23:03:07Z","closed_at":"2016-05-31T23:03:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6d632d876128c078bfa66583b18f5dc3331dd028","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13322/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13322/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13322/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d63912218a050bd87ab265bb8910f0e77b211244","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:outer-join","ref":"outer-join","sha":"d63912218a050bd87ab265bb8910f0e77b211244","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSparkSession has a list of unnecessary private[sql] methods. These methods cause some trouble because private[sql] doesn't apply in Java. In the cases that they are easy to remove, we can simply remove them. This patch does that.\n\nAs part of this pull request, I also replaced a bunch of protected[sql] with private[sql], to tighten up visibility.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUpdated test cases to reflect the changes.\n","created_at":"2016-05-26T06:37:00Z","updated_at":"2016-05-26T20:05:07Z","closed_at":"2016-05-26T20:05:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e8868d8a822136f0e94372e53219a7bcbfcbeb0e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13319/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13319/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13319/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f0f6e855bd293b72ee9a3f1740fcfe14cc68a054","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-15552","ref":"SPARK-15552","sha":"f0f6e855bd293b72ee9a3f1740fcfe14cc68a054","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, the memory for temporary buffer used by TimSort is always allocated as on-heap without bookkeeping, it could cause OOM both in on-heap and off-heap mode.\n\nThis PR will try to manage that by preallocate it together with the pointer array, same with RadixSort. It both works for on-heap and off-heap mode.\n\nThis PR also change the loadFactor of BytesToBytesMap to 0.5 (it was 0.70), it enables use to radix sort also makes sure that we have enough memory for timsort. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests.\n","created_at":"2016-05-26T06:36:37Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T23:47:51Z","closed_at":"2016-06-03T23:47:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c55ad7785f3817c5d000b0658c58548df0a06733","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13318/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13318/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13318/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a929a0600b5cd78917989a5559275a4a4e9f1812","head":{"label":"davies:fix_timsort","ref":"fix_timsort","sha":"a929a0600b5cd78917989a5559275a4a4e9f1812","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSeveral classes and methods have been deprecated and are creating lots of build warnings in branch-2.0. This issue is to identify and fix those items:\n- WithSGD classes: Change to make class not deprecated, object deprecated, and public class constructor deprecated. Any public use will require a deprecated API. We need to keep a non-deprecated private API since we cannot eliminate certain uses: Python API, streaming algs, and examples.\n  - Use in PythonMLlibAPI: Change to using private constructors\n  - Streaming algs: No warnings after we un-deprecate the classes\n  - Examples: Deprecate or change ones which use deprecated APIs\n- MulticlassMetrics fields (precision, etc.)\n- LinearRegressionSummary.model field\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen running`./R/install-dev.sh` in **Mac OS EI Captain** environment, I got\n\n```\nmbp185-xr:spark xin$ ./R/install-dev.sh\nusage: dirname path\n```\n\nThis message is very confusing to me, and then I found R is not properly configured on my Mac when this script is using `$(which R)` to get R home.\n\nI tried similar situation on CentOS with R missing, and it's giving me very clear error message while MacOS is not.\non CentOS:\n\n```\n[root@ip-xxx-31-9-xx spark]# which R\n/usr/bin/which: no R in (/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk.x86_64/bin:/root/bin)\n```\n\nbut on Mac, if not found then nothing returned and this is causing the confusing message for R build failure and running R/install-dev.sh:\n\n```\nmbp185-xr:spark xin$ which R\nmbp185-xr:spark xin$\n```\n\nHere I just added a clear message for this miss configuration for R when running `R/install-dev.sh`.\n\n```\nmbp185-xr:spark xin$ ./R/install-dev.sh\nCannot find R home by running 'which R', please make sure R is properly installed.\n```\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFor some of the test cases, e.g. `OrcSourceSuite`, it will create temp folders and temp files inside them. But after tests finish, the folders are not removed. This will cause lots of temp files created and space occupied, if we keep running the test cases.\n\nThe reason is dir.delete() won't work if dir is not empty. We need to recursively delete the content before deleting the folder.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually checked the temp folder to make sure the temp files were

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently only `DataFrameReader.csv(...): DataFrame` does not support converting Dataset[String] to a DataFrame. \n\nThis PR is to add the API `DataFrameReader.csv(rdd: Dataset[String]): DataFrame`. Also in order to easily invoke the helper functions that are already implemented for csv parsing, I moved some of the private methods from `csv.DefaultSource` to `CSVRelation`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nA test case is added to load csv files to Dataset[String] and covert to DataFrame and check the results. \nRegression test is run.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe ANTLR4 SBT plugin has been moved from its own repo to one on bintray. The version was also changed from `0.7.10` to `0.7.11`. The latter actually broke our build (@ihji has fixed this by also adding `0.7.10` and others to the bin-tray repo).\n\nThis PR upgrades the SBT-ANTLR4 plugin and ANTLR4 to their most recent versions (`0.7.11`/`4.5.3`). I have also removed a few obsolete build configurations.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually running SBT/Maven builds.\n","created_at":"2016-05-25T17:41:34Z","updated_at":"2016-05-25T22:37:40Z","closed_at":"2016-05-25T22:37:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7b15740dd63824bd9d9d2e7519bf41fa301f4d6a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13299/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13299/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13299/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3b042b546cce4d3aacbfa83f5ee3b560f3e18f4c","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-15525","ref":"SPARK-15525","sha":"3b042b546cce4d3aacbfa83f5ee3b560f3e18f4c","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently structured streaming only supports append output mode.  This PR adds the following.\n- Added support for Complete output mode in the internal state store, analyzer and planner.\n- Added public API in Scala and Python for users to specify output mode\n- Added checks for unsupported combinations of output mode and DF operations\n  - Plans with no aggregation should support only Append mode\n  - Plans with aggregation should support only Update and Complete modes\n  - Default output mode is Append mode (**Question: should we change this to automatically set to Complete mode when there is aggregation?**)\n- Added support for Complete output mode in Memory Sink. So Memory Sink internally supports append and complete, update. But from public API only Complete and Append output modes are supported.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests in various test suites\n- StreamingAggregationSuite: tests for complete mode\n- MemorySinkSuite: tests for checking behavior in Append and Complete modes. \n- UnsupportedOperationSuite: tests for checking unsupported combinations of DF ops and output modes\n- DataFrameReaderWriterSuite: tests for checking that output mode cannot be called on static DFs\n- Python doc test and existing unit tests modified to call write.outputMode.\n","created_at":"2016-05-24T23:02:44Z","updated_at":"2016-06-02T16:04:36Z","closed_at":"2016-05-31T22:59:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5ced8aa5e5761409d82b11923f0a207843280f5e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13286/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13286/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13286/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e951798bf4511cabc08d242e7f1a3d7d1e653263","head":{"label":"tdas:complete-mode","ref":"complete-mode","sha":"e951798bf4511cabc08d242e7f1a3d7d1e653263","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is to address the following issues: \n- **ISSUE 1:** For ORC source format, we are reporting the strange error message when we did not enable Hive support: \n\n``` SQL\nSQL Example: \n  select id from `org.apache.spark.sql.hive.orc`.`file_path`\nError Message:\n  Table or view not found: `org.apache.spark.sql.hive.orc`.`file_path`\n```\n\nInstead, we should issue the error message like:\n\n```\nExpected Error Message:\n   The ORC data source must be used with Hive support enabled\n```\n- **ISSUE 2:** For the Avro format, we report the strange error message like:\n\nThe example query is like\n\n``` SQL\nSQL Example: \n  select id from `avro`.`file_path`\n  select id from `com.databricks.spark.avro`.`file_path`\nError Message:\n  Table or view not found: `com.databricks.spark.avro`.`file_path`\n```\n\nThe desired message should be like:\n\n```\nExpected Error Message:\n  Failed to find data source: avro. Please use Spark package http://spark-packages.org/package/databricks/spark-avro\"\n```\n- ~~**ISSUE 3:** Unable to detect incompatibility libraries for Spark 2.0 in Data Source Resolution. We report a strange error message:~~\n\n**Update**: The latest code changes contains \n- For JDBC format, we added an extra checking in the rule `ResolveRelations` of `Analyzer`. Without the PR, Spark will return the error message like: `Option 'url' not specified`. Now, we are reporting `Unsupported data source type for direct query on files: jdbc` \n- Make data source format name case incensitive so that error handling behaves consistent with the normal cases. \n- Added the test cases for all the supported formats. \n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test cases to cover all the above

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nPreviously, SPARK-8893 added the constraints on positive number of partitions for repartition/coalesce operations in general.

Number of partitions (0) must be positive.\n...\nscala> sc.parallelize(1 to 5).repartition(0).collect()\nres1: Array[Int] = Array()   // empty\nscala> spark.sql(\"select 1\").coalesce(0)\nres2: org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] = [1: int]\nscala> spark.sql(\"select 1\").coalesce(0).collect()\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: requirement failed: Number of partitions

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11272 to the 1.6.x version line.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis PR was tested the same way as the original PR: manual testing with a local mesos cluster.\n\n…s before application has stopped\n\nMesos shuffle service is completely unusable since Spark 1.6.0 . The problem seems to occur since the move from akka to netty in the networking layer. Until now, a connection from the driver to each shuffle service was used as a signal for the shuffle service to determine, whether the driver is still running. Since 1.6.0, this connection is closed after spark.shuffle.io.connectionTimeout (or spark.network.timeout if the former is not set) due to it being idle. The shuffle service interprets this as a signal that the driver has stopped, despite the driver still being alive. Thus, shuffle files are deleted before the application has stopped.\n\nspark shuffle fails with mesos after 2mins: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12583\nExternal shuffle service broken w/ Mesos: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13159\n\nThis is a follow up on #11207 .\n\nThis PR adds a heartbeat signal from the Driver (in MesosExternalShuffleClient) to all registered external mesos shuffle service instances. In MesosExternalShuffleBlockHandler, a thread periodically checks whether a driver has timed out and cleans an application's shuffle files if this is the case.\n\nThis patch has been tested on a small mesos test cluster using the spark-shell. Log output from mesos shuffle service:\n\n```\n16/02/19 15:13:45 INFO mesos.MesosExternalShuffleBlockHandler: Received registration request from app 294def07-3249-4e0f-8d71-bf8c83c58a50-0018 (remote address /xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:52391, heartbeat timeout 120000 ms).\n16/02/19 15:13:47 INFO shuffle.ExternalShuffleBlockResolver: Registered executor AppExecId{appId=294def07-3249-4e0f-8d71-bf8c83c58a50-0018, execId=3} with ExecutorShuffleInfo{localDirs=[/foo/blockmgr-c84c0697-a3f9-4f61-9c64-4d3ee227c047], subDirsPerLocalDir=64, shuffleManager=sort}\n16/02/19 15:13:47 INFO shuffle.ExternalShuffleBlockResolver: Registered executor AppExecId{appId=294def07-3249-4e0f-8d71-bf8c83c58a50-0018, execId=7} with ExecutorShuffleInfo{localDirs=[/foo/blockmgr-bf46497a-de80-47b9-88f9-563123b59e03], subDirsPerLocalDir=64, shuffleManager=sort}\n16/02/19 15:16:02 INFO mesos.MesosExternalShuffleBlockHandler: Application 294def07-3249-4e0f-8d71-bf8c83c58a50-0018 timed out.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe test cases for  `list` command added in `CliSuite` by PR #13212 can not run in some jenkins jobs after being merged. \nHowever, some jenkins jobs can pass:\nhttps://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.6/\nhttps://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.4/\nhttps://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.2/\nhttps://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.7/\nhttps://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.3/\n\nOthers failed on this test case. But the failures on those jobs are at slightly different checkpoints among different jobs too. So it seems that CliSuite's output capture is flaky for list commands to check for expected output. There are test cases already in `HiveQuerySuite` and `SparkContextSuite` to cover the cases. So I am ignoring 2 test cases added by PR #13212

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nTo python/run-tests.py script, I add the following parameters:\n\n`--single-test=SINGLE_TEST`\n`specify a python module to run single python test.`\n`--debug-server=DEBUG_SERVER`\n`debug server host, only used in single test.`\n`--debug-port=DEBUG_PORT`\n`debug server port, only used in single test.`\n\nNow, for example, I want to debug only pyspark.tests, I can use the following command:\n(first startup debug server in your python IDE such as pycharm or pydev, your IED on machine which has host MY_DEV_MACHINE and using debug port 5678, and make sure the machine running test can connect to MY_DEV_MACHINE, and python must install pydevd module first.)\n\n`python/run-tests --python-executables=python2.7 --single-test=pyspark.tests --debug-server=MY_DEV_MACHINE --debug-port=5678`\n\nthe parameter --single-test specify the single python testsuite you want to test, currently you can use the following value:\n\n`pyspark.tests`\n`pyspark.ml.tests`\n`pyspark.mllib.tests`\n`pyspark.sql.tests`\n`pyspark.streaming.tests`\n\nAdding parameters then develop and debug python script will be quite easier, I

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR fixes 3 slow tests:\n1. `ParquetQuerySuite.read/write wide table`: This is not a good unit test as it runs more than 5 minutes. This PR removes it and add a new regression test in `CodeGenerationSuite`, which is more \"unit\".\n2. `ParquetQuerySuite.returning batch for wide table`: reduce the threshold and use smaller data size.\n3. `DatasetSuite.SPARK-14554: Dataset.map may generate wrong java code for wide table`: Improve `CodeFormatter.format`(introduced at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12979) can dramatically speed this it up.\n## How was this patch

helps with preventing jdk8-specific calls being checked in,\nbecause PR builders are running the compiler with the wrong settings.\n\nIf the JAVA_7_HOME env variable is set, assume it points at\na jdk7 and use its rt.jar when invoking javac. For zinc, just run\nit with jdk7, and disable it when building jdk8-specific code.\n\nA big note for sbt usage: adding the bootstrap options forces sbt\nto fork the compiler, and that disables incremental compilation.\nThat means that it's really not convenient to use for normal\ndevelopment, but should be ok for automated builds.\n\nTested with JAVA_HOME=jdk8 and JAVA_7_HOME=jdk7:\n- mvn + zinc\n- mvn sans zinc\n- sbt\n\nVerified that in all cases, jdk8-specific library calls fail

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR optimize the display of explain in a couple of ways. The goal is:\n1.  Some tree nodes are unnecessarily verbose, this PR makes them simpler and easier to \n   read. (E.g., `Aggregate`.)\n2.  Some tree nodes are not verbose enough. E.g., output attributes of physical plan \n   nodes are not shown.\n3.  Output formats of various tree nodes are inconsistent.\n   \n   E.g., both formats below are used to show key value pairs in different tree nodes:\n   -   `key: value`\n   -   `key = value`\n\nMajor changes made in this PR include:\n1.  **Format the display for output attributes.**\n   \n   Before this change, the way we display output attributes is in-consistent. Some plan \n   nodes print plan output attribute, while others don't; some prints the output attributes\n   at the head of a line, some prints at the tail.\n   \n   **Before change:**\n   \n   ```\n   scala> Seq((1,2,3)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\").createTempView(\"df1\") \n   scala> spark.sql(\"select * from df1\").explain()\n   == Physical Plan ==\n   LocalTableScan [a#128,b#129,c#130], [[1,2,3]]\n   ```\n   \n   **After change:**\n   \n   Now we always print output attributes at the end of the line for \n   `explain(extended = true)`:\n   \n   ```\n   scala> spark.sql(\"select * from df1\").explain(true)\n   == Physical Plan ==\n   LocalTableScan output = [a#7, b#8, c#9]\n   ```\n   \n   For `explain(extended = false)`, output attributes are **NOT** shown.\n   \n   ```\n   scala> spark.sql(\"select * from df1\").explain()\n   == Physical Plan ==\n   LocalTableScan\n   ```\n2.  **Make the Aggregation output simple:**\n   \n   **Before change:**\n   \n   ```\n   scala> spark.sql(\"select count(a), count(c), b from df1 group by b\").explain()\n   == Physical Plan ==\n   *TungstenAggregate(key=[b#8], functions=[(count(1),mode=Final,isDistinct=false),(count(1),mode=Final,isDistinct=false)], output=[count(a)#63L,count(c)#64L,b#8])\n   +- Exchange hashpartitioning(b#8, 200), None\n   +- *TungstenAggregate(key=[b#8], functions=[(count(1),mode=Partial,isDistinct=false),(count(1),mode=Partial,isDistinct=false)], output=[b#8,count#67L,count#68L])\n       +- LocalTableScan [b#8], [[2]]\n   ```\n   \n   **After change:**\n   \n   ```\n   scala> spark.sql(\"select count(a), count(c), b from df1 group by b\").explain()\n   == Physical Plan ==\n   *TungstenAggregate [b#8], [count([1]), count([1])]\n   +- Exchange hashpartitioning([b#8], 200)\n   +- *TungstenAggregate [b#8], [count([1]), count([1])]\n       +- LocalTableScan\n   ```\n   \n   For explain(true), the output is:\n   \n   ```\n   == Physical Plan ==\n   *TungstenAggregate [b#8], [count([1])(Final), count([1])(Final)], output = [count(a)#92L, count(c)#93L, b#8]\n   +- Exchange hashpartitioning([b#8], 200), output = [b#8, count#96L, count#97L]\n   +- *TungstenAggregate [b#8], [count([1])(Partial), count([1])(Partial)], output = [b#8, count#96L, count#97L]\n       +- LocalTableScan output = [b#8]\n   ```\n3.  **Avoid printing internal row in explain tree:**\n   \n   **Before change:**\n   \n   ```\n   scala> (1 to 10).toSeq.map(_ => (1,2,3)).toDF().createTempView(\"df2\")\n   scala> spark.sql(\"select * from df2\").explain()\n   == Physical Plan ==\n   LocalTableScan [_1#89,_2#90,_3#91], [[0,1,2,3],[0,1,2,3],[0,1,2,3],[0,1,2,3],[0,1,2,3],[0,1,2,3],[0,1,2,3],[0,1,2,3],[0,1,2,3],[0,1,2,3]]\n   ```\n   \n   **After change:**\n   \n   ```\n   scala> (1 to 10).toSeq.map(_ => (1,2,3)).toDF().createTempView(\"df2\")\n   scala> spark.sql(\"select * from df2\").explain(true)\n   ...\n   == Physical Plan ==\n   LocalTableScan output = [_1#101, _2#102, _3#103]\n   ```\n4.  **Fix the tree Display for expressions:**\n   \n   **Before change**:\n   \n   Before change, each line print duplicated child nodes, which is super long for examples like encoder:\n   \n   ```\n   scala> import org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.dsl.expressions._\n   scala> import org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Literal\n   scala> println((Literal(1)+Literal(2)).treeString)\n   (1 + 2)\n   :- 1\n   +- 2\n   ```\n   \n   **After change:**\n   \n   ```\n   scala> import org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.dsl.expressions._\n   scala> import org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Literal\n   scala> println((Literal(1)+Literal(2)).treeString)\n   add\n   :- literal(1, IntegerType)\n   +- literal(2, IntegerType)\n   ```\n5.  **Optimize the output for some primitive types.**\n   \n   For example, before this change, we may print thing like \"isDistinct = true\", now we just print \"isDistinct\". We also optimized the output for Option, Seq, String, and etc..\n6.  **Each plan and expression now supports verbose mode**. Each plan can choose to print additional attributes in verbose mode.\n   \n   API like this:\n   \n   ```\n   override protected def argumentsForStringOutput(verbose: Boolean): Seq[(String, Any)]\n   ```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual test and existing UT.\n","created_at":"2016-05-24T01:28:40Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T23:01:06Z","closed_at":"2016-05-27T21:10:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dfc5e26e4df80860baa6a98aee6d6f2c7c6ed976","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13271/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13271/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13271/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b430f6d942c7cb332e835d98570289bd01cc5d7c","head":{"label":"clockfly:verbose3","ref":"verbose3","sha":"b430f6d942c7cb332e835d98570289bd01cc5d7c","user":{"login":"clockfly","id":2595532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTU1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly","html_url":"https://github.com/clockfly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":57937220,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NzkzNzIyMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"clockfly/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"clockfly","id":2595532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTU1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly","html_url":"https://github.com/clockfly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/clockfly/spark","description":"Mirror

PR is an alternative to #13120 authored by @xwu0226.\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen creating an external Spark SQL data source table and persisting its metadata to Hive metastore, we don't use the standard Hive `Table.dataLocation` field because Hive only allows directory paths as data locations while Spark SQL also allows file paths. However, if we don't set `Table.dataLocation`, Hive always creates an unexpected empty table directory under database location, but doesn't remove it while dropping the table (because the table is external).\n\nThis PR works around this issue by explicitly setting `Table.dataLocation` and then manullay removing the created directory after creating the external table.\n\nPlease refer to [this JIRA comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15269?focusedCommentId=15297408&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15297408) for more details about why we chose this approach as a workaround.\n## How was this patch tested?\n1. A new test case is added in `HiveQuerySuite` for this case\n2. Updated `ShowCreateTableSuite` to use the same table name in all test cases. (This is how I hit this issue at the first place.)\n","created_at":"2016-05-24T00:41:50Z","updated_at":"2016-06-01T23:04:21Z","closed_at":"2016-06-01T23:04:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e8fec98dbbbfe002a8b59f25eadaad2d48f5838","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13270/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13270/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13270/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7d0122f9e59e83683b1539c9c8e2be3b2c6f5658","head":{"label":"liancheng:spark-15269-unpleasant-fix","ref":"spark-15269-unpleasant-fix","sha":"7d0122f9e59e83683b1539c9c8e2be3b2c6f5658","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nOur encoder framework has been evolved a lot, this PR tries to clean up the code to make it more readable and emphasise the concept that encoder should be used as a container of serde expressions.\n1. move validation logic to analyzer instead of encoder\n2. only have a `resolveAndBind` method in encoder instead of `resolve` and `bind`, as we don't have the encoder life cycle concept anymore.\n3. `Dataset` don't need to keep a resolved encoder, as there is no such concept anymore. bound encoder is still needed to do serialization outside of query framework.\n4. Using `BoundReference` to represent an unresolved field in deserializer expression is kind of weird, this PR adds a `GetColumnByOrdinal` for this purpose. (serializer expression still use `BoundReference`, we can replace it with `GetColumnByOrdinal` in follow-ups)\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdd a warning log for the case that `numIterations * miniBatchFraction <1.0` during gradient descent. If the product of those two numbers is less than `1.0`, then not all training examples will be used during optimization. To put this concretely, suppose that `numExamples = 100`, `miniBatchFraction = 0.2` and `numIterations = 3`. Then, 3 iterations will occur each sampling approximately 6 examples each. In the best case, each of the 6 examples are unique; hence 18/100 examples are used. \n\nThis may be counter-intuitive to most users and led to the issue during the development of another Spark  ML model: https://github.com/zhengruifeng/spark-libFM/issues/11. If a user actually does not require the training data set, it would be easier and more intuitive to use `RDD.sample`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n`build/mvn -DskipTests clean package` build succeeds\n","created_at":"2016-05-23T20:53:34Z","updated_at":"2016-05-25T21:54:17Z","closed_at":"2016-05-25T21:54:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8db2db12da4ebc992a16453ee448b47ba5eaa56e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13265/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13265/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13265/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0754ce08148adb9debd70fdfc65a9c0d40532af5","head":{"label":"Hydrotoast:master","ref":"master","sha":"0754ce08148adb9debd70fdfc65a9c0d40532af5","user":{"login":"Hydrotoast","id":246905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjkwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydrotoast","html_url":"https://github.com/Hydrotoast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydrotoast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydrotoast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydrotoast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydrotoast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydrotoast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydrotoast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydrotoast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydrotoast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydrotoast/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59513327,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTUxMzMyNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"Hydrotoast/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Hydrotoast","id":246905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjkwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydrotoast","html_url":"https://github.com/Hydrotoast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydrotoast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydrotoast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydrotoast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydrotoast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydrotoast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydrotoast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydrotoast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydrotoast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hydrotoast/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Hydrotoast/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n- Document `WeightedLeastSquares`(normal equation) and `IterativelyReweightedLeastSquares`.\n- Copy `L-BFGS` documents from `spark.mllib` to `spark.ml`.\n\nDue to the session `Optimization of linear methods` is used for developers, I think we should provide the brief introduction of the optimization method, necessary references and how it implements in Spark. It's not necessary to paste all mathematical formula and derivation here. If developers/users want to learn more, they can track reference. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nDocument update, no tests.\n","created_at":"2016-05-23T13:40:57Z","updated_at":"2016-05-28T10:29:24Z","closed_at":"2016-05-27T20:18:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f917c972f3e1c3e21f5caeb572eb84157f1b3e54","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13262/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13262/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13262/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/23f1d7b50ebbef96aa5b2048ce855802b242f96f","head":{"label":"yanboliang:spark-15484","ref":"spark-15484","sha":"23f1d7b50ebbef96aa5b2048ce855802b242f96f","user":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21890948,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTg5MDk0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"yanboliang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIt's a bug in Streaming UI. If BatchDuration is changed by window operation, InputInfo on time with no output ops will not be shown in streaming UI.\n\nHere is a simple example to reproduce:\n\n``` scala\nval inputDStream = KafkaUtils.createDirectStream[String, String, StringDecoder, StringDecoder](ssc, kafkaParam, topic)\nval matchedDStream = inputDStream.window(batchInteval*2, batchInteval*2)\nmatchedDStream.foreachRDD(rdd => {\n    val count = rdd.count()\n    println(s\"2 count number: ${count}\")\n})\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nmanually tested\n\nI manually input 6 records from Kafka.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch adds partitioned `csv`, `json`, `text` format support for `FileStreamSink`.\n\nFor each format, this patch adds a dedicated `OutputWriterFactory`, which would return a dedicated `OutputWriter` writing data without using an `OutputCommitter`. This is the same approach taken by [SPARK-14716](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12409) in which we had added partitioned `parquet` format support.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n`FileStreamSinkSuite` is expanded to cover the added `csv`, `json`, `text` format:\n\n``` scala\ntest(\" csv - unpartitioned data\")\ntest(\"json - unpartitioned data\")\ntest(\"text - unpartitioned data\")\n\ntest(\" csv - partitioned data\")\ntest(\"json - partitioned data\")\ntest(\"text - partitioned data\")\n\ntest(\" csv - unpartitioned writing and batch reading\")\ntest(\"json - unpartitioned writing and batch reading\")\ntest(\"text - unpartitioned writing and batch reading\")\n\ntest(\" csv - partitioned writing and batch reading\")\ntest(\"json - partitioned writing and batch reading\")\ntest(\"text - partitioned writing and batch

[SPARK-15429] [Streaming] Make PIDRateEstimator more suitable to the situation of  `spark.streaming.concurrentJobs > 1`\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFirst, add a new parameter `concurrentJobs` to PIDRateEstimator.\nSecond, We can change the `error = latestRate - processingRate` to `error = latestRate - processingRate * concurrentJobs.toDouble`. And change the `historicalError = schedulingDelay.toDouble * processingRate / batchIntervalMillis` to `historicalError = schedulingDelay.toDouble * processingRate * concurrentJobs.toDouble / batchIntervalMillis`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUse `PIDRateEstimatorSuite`  to test.\n","created_at":"2016-05-22T14:48:13Z","updated_at":"2016-10-25T01:22:12Z","closed_at":"2016-10-25T01:22:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13255/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13255/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13255/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/661e8ddad43f356a73fa47f00b589b99c8ca9349","head":{"label":"fishjoy:SPARK-15429","ref":"SPARK-15429","sha":"661e8ddad43f356a73fa47f00b589b99c8ca9349","user":{"login":"fishjoy","id":14273620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjczNjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14273620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishjoy","html_url":"https://github.com/fishjoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishjoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishjoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishjoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishjoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishjoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishjoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishjoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishjoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishjoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":48273296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0ODI3MzI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"fishjoy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fishjoy","id":14273620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjczNjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14273620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishjoy","html_url":"https://github.com/fishjoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishjoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishjoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishjoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishjoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishjoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishjoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishjoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishjoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fishjoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fishjoy/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch adds support for partitioned `text` format in FileStreamSink.\n\nSpecifically, this patch adds a new `TextOutputWriterFactory`, which would return an `OutputWriter` writing data without using an `OutputCommitter`.\n\n This is the same manner employed by [SPARK-14716](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12409) in which we had added support for partitioned `parquet` format.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThe `FileStreamSinkSuite` is expanded to cover tests added for the partitioned `text`

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe introduced `RuntimeConfig` in `SQLContext` in the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12669. Now, `SQLContext` has both `conf` and `runtimeConf`. `SQLContext` is being replaced by `SparkSession`. Like `SparkSession`, we should not have two configuration interfaces. That means, we should not expose `conf` to external users.\n\nThis PR contains three major parts:\n1. removed `conf` from `SQLContext`. \n2. added the missing functions into `RuntimeConfig`, including two `set` functions and one `clear` function.\n3. fixed the test cases in `SparkSessionBuilderSuite.scala`. Without this fix, we are unable to individually run the test cases. All the test cases require `initialSession`.  \n\n@rxin @andrewor14 @yhuai @cloud-fan  Do you think this PR is valid?

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`SparkSession` greatly reduces the number of concepts which Spark users must know. Currently, `SparkSession` is defined as the entry point to programming Spark with the Dataset and DataFrame API. And, we can easily get `RDD` by calling `Dataset.rdd` or `DataFrame.rdd`, too.\n\nHowever, many usages (including examples) are observed to **extract `SparkSession.sparkContext`** and **keep it as own variable** to call **`parallelize`**.\n\nIf `SparkSession` supports RDD seamlessly too, it would be great for usability. We can do this by simply adding `parallelize` API.\n\n**Example**\n\n``` scala\n object SparkPi {\n   def main(args: Array[String]) {\n     val spark = SparkSession\n       .builder\n       .appName(\"Spark Pi\")\n       .getOrCreate()\n-    val sc = spark.sparkContext\n     val slices = if (args.length > 0) args(0).toInt else 2\n     val n = math.min(100000L * slices, Int.MaxValue).toInt // avoid overflow\n-    val count = sc.parallelize(1 until n, slices).map { i =>\n+    val count = spark.parallelize(1 until n, slices).map { i =>\n     val count = spark.parallelize(1 until n, slices).map { i =>\n       val x = random * 2 - 1\n       val y = random * 2 - 1\n       if (x*x + y*y < 1) 1 else 0\n     }.reduce(_ + _)\n     println(\"Pi is roughly \" + 4.0 * count / n)\n     spark.stop()\n   }\n }\n```\n\n``` python\n spark = SparkSession\\\n   .builder\\\n   .appName(\"PythonPi\")\\\n   .getOrCreate()\n\n- sc = spark._sc\n-\n partitions = int(sys.argv[1]) if len(sys.argv) > 1 else 2\n n = 100000 * partitions\n\n def f(_):\n   x = random() * 2 - 1\n   y = random() * 2 - 1\n   return 1 if x ** 2 + y ** 2 < 1 else 0\n\n-count = sc.parallelize(range(1, n + 1), partitions).map(f).reduce(add)\n+count = spark.parallelize(range(1, n + 1), partitions).map(f).reduce(add)\n print(\"Pi is roughly %f\" % (4.0 * count / n))\n\n spark.stop()\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPass the Jenkins test (with new python test) and also manual.\n","created_at":"2016-05-21T21:41:03Z","updated_at":"2016-07-20T07:36:28Z","closed_at":"2016-05-23T03:30:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"37827b1910606aebf5618b65484c42b0143d0539","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13245/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13245/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13245/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4f6a69e75d3c96f3b2ed9d93edf8d1bf958acf1c","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-15466","ref":"SPARK-15466","sha":"4f6a69e75d3c96f3b2ed9d93edf8d1bf958acf1c","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"201a51f36682726d78d9d2fe2c388093bb860ee0","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch simplifies the implementation of Range operator and make the explain string consistent between logical plan and physical plan. To do this, I changed RangeExec to embed a Range logical plan in it.\n\nBefore this patch (note that the logical Range and physical Range actually output different information):\n\n```\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\nRange 0, 100, 2, 2, [id#8L]\n\n== Physical Plan ==\n*Range 0, 2, 2, 50, [id#8L]\n```\n\nAfter this patch:\nIf step size is 1:\n\n```\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\nRange(0, 100, splits=2)\n\n== Physical Plan ==\n*Range(0, 100, splits=2)\n```\n\nIf step size is not 1:\n\n```\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\nRange (0, 100, step=2, splits=2)\n\n== Physical Plan ==\n*Range (0, 100,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIf the user relies on the schema to be inferred in file streams can break easily for multiple reasons\n- accidentally running on a directory which has no data\n- schema changing underneath\n- on restart, the query will infer schema again, and may unexpectedly infer incorrect schema, as the file in the directory may be different at the time of the restart.\n\nTo avoid these complicated scenarios, for Spark 2.0, we are going to disable schema inferencing by default with a config, so that user is forced to consider explicitly what is the schema it wants, rather than the system trying to infer it and run into weird corner cases.\n\nIn this PR, I introduce a SQLConf that determines whether schema inference for file streams is allowed or not. It is disabled by default. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUpdated unit tests that test error behavior with and without schema inference enabled.\n","created_at":"2016-05-21T01:32:59Z","updated_at":"2016-05-24T21:29:37Z","closed_at":"2016-05-24T21:29:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f33f6476b1d55f95d4d4cfcab7f352baba894d07","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13238/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13238/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13238/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f6a536dba289f1d0f723c74e6c2e34a24f3fd138","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-15458","ref":"SPARK-15458","sha":"f6a536dba289f1d0f723c74e6c2e34a24f3fd138","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nUpdate of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/8760 by @mwws.  The current blacklist mechanism only considers one task a time -- this expands that by considering:\n1. When we determine an executor is bad, we blacklist _all_ tasks from that blacklist, both within the taskset and subsequent task sets.\n2. When many executors on a node appear to be bad, we blacklist the entire node.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests via jenkins.\nAlso I ran the additional tests proposed [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/8559) which include blacklist tests. \n\nTODO:\n- [x] performance tests\n- [ ] clear memory as task sets complete\n- [ ] a few more unit tests to write (see TODOs in code)\n- [ ] simplify some usage of the cache\n- [ ] add executor-level blacklisting\n- [ ] more internal comments (in particular on concurrency)\n- [ ] manual testing on a cluster\n","created_at":"2016-05-20T21:20:19Z","updated_at":"2016-06-28T19:08:46Z","closed_at":"2016-06-22T18:12:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d4c45eb1c9ba04c5b80441619eb5054d79bd5060","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13234/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13234/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13234/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8f2534b1d4d90f1ed42c695a77f5a2fa588d3428","head":{"label":"squito:blacklist-SPARK-8426","ref":"blacklist-SPARK-8426","sha":"8f2534b1d4d90f1ed42c695a77f5a2fa588d3428","user":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29212749,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTIxMjc0OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"squito/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/squito/spark","description":"Mirror

PR adds the `relativeError` param to PySpark's `QuantileDiscretizer` to match Scala.\n\nAlso cleaned up a duplication of `numBuckets` where the param is both a class and instance attribute (I removed the instance attr to match the style of params throughout `ml`).\n\nFinally, cleaned up the docs for `QuantileDiscretizer` to reflect that it now uses `approxQuantile`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nA little doctest and built API docs locally to check HTML doc generation.\n","created_at":"2016-05-20T19:59:56Z","updated_at":"2016-05-24T08:06:38Z","closed_at":"2016-05-24T08:04:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e056781c9a64f0ea1d7ae29f03b0aa9865e2568","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13228/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13228/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13228/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6417384f3b8a29dadea1089fdccb150a00cf26ad","head":{"label":"MLnick:SPARK-15442-py-relerror-param","ref":"SPARK-15442-py-relerror-param","sha":"6417384f3b8a29dadea1089fdccb150a00cf26ad","user":{"login":"MLnick","id":1036807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzY4MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1036807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick","html_url":"https://github.com/MLnick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":56315295,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NjMxNTI5NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"MLnick/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MLnick","id":1036807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzY4MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1036807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick","html_url":"https://github.com/MLnick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MLnick/spark","description":"Mirror
