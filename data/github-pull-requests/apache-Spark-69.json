What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to change the default value for `numeric_only` with related functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere are many functions that support `numeric_only` parameter have changed their default value from `True` to `False` from Pandas 2.0.0, so we should follow their behavior. See https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/whatsnew/v2.0.0.html for more detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the default value for `numeric_only` is changed to `False`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated the related UTs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add a few more examples for `LIKE`, `ILIKE`, `RLIKE`, `regexp_instr()`, `regexp_extract_all()` that highlight correctness of current description and test a couple more of corner cases.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe description of `LIKE` says:\r\n```\r\n... in order to match \"\\abc\", the pattern should be \"\\\\abc\"\r\n```\r\nbut in Spark SQL shell:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> SELECT c FROM t;\r\n\\abc\r\nspark-sql (default)> SELECT c LIKE \"\\\\abc\" FROM t;\r\n[INVALID_FORMAT.ESC_IN_THE_MIDDLE] The format is invalid: '\\\\abc'. The escape character is not allowed to precede 'a'.\r\nspark-sql (default)> SELECT c LIKE \"\\\\\\\\abc\" FROM t;\r\ntrue\r\n```\r\nSo, the description might confuse users since the pattern must contain 4 slashes when the pattern is a regular SQL string.\r\n\r\nNew example shows that the pattern \"\\\\abc\" is correct if we take into account the string as a raw string:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> SELECT c LIKE R\"\\\\abc\" FROM t;\r\ntrue\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new and modified tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *.StringFunctionsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.ExpressionInfoSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to enable `spark.eventLog.compress` by default for Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- To save the event log storage cost by compressing the logs with ZStandard codec by default\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nAlthough we added a migration guide, the old Spark

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37268 which supports stage level task resource profile for standalone cluster when dynamic allocation disabled. This PR enables stage-level task resource profile for yarn cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUsers who work on spark ML/DL cases running on Yarn would expect stage-level task resource profile feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe current tests of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37268 can also cover this PR since both yarn and standalone cluster share the same TaskSchedulerImpl class which implements this feature. Apart from that, modifying the existing test to cover yarn cluster.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to update the `jinja2` version from `dev/requirements.txt` to the latest version for PySpark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `jinja2<3.0.0` is installed when running `pip install -r dev/requirements.txt`, but it's not working for some functionality for Pandas API on Spark from 4.0.0 release.\r\n\r\nBecause Pandas requires the latest version of `jinja2` for their LaTex render engine, so Pandas API on Spark also requires the same version since we're leverage the Pandas internally.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"728\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-09-21 at 2 06 23 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/44108233/1f0bbb15-829c-473b-bb47-e602fa6cb04d\">\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThe existing CI should pass.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-09-21T05:12:05Z","updated_at":"2023-11-20T01:36:44Z","closed_at":"2023-09-22T03:39:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9c7e4116b1c827574461f0fa0c45853ce4e5e907","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43024/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43024/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43024/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3699c67db1457e50effce660f2ceeaccfa2376e1","head":{"label":"itholic:SPARK-45246","ref":"SPARK-45246","sha":"3699c67db1457e50effce660f2ceeaccfa2376e1","user":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445423122,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoyeEg","name":"spark","full_name":"itholic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/itholic/spark","description":"Apache

If the worker does not connect back, accept() waits forever. There is supposed to be 10 seconds timeout, but it was not implemented correctly.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a 10 second timeout. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOtherwise create method could be stuck forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n - Unit test\r\n - Manual\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nGenerated-by: ChatGPT 4.0\r\nAsked ChatGPT to generate sample code to do non-blocking accept() on a socket channel in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix a subtle thread-safety issue with CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend where an executor process randomly gets stuck\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes

However, they read and write a common object (i.e., taskResources) that's a mutable hashmap without thread-safety, in [Executor](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/1fdd46f173f7bc90e0523eb0a2d5e8e27e990102/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/executor/Executor.scala#L561) and [CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/1fdd46f173f7bc90e0523eb0a2d5e8e27e990102/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/executor/CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend.scala#L189), respectively.\r\n\r\n### What's going on?\r\n\r\nBased on the above observations, our hypothesis is that the dispatcher thread runs into an \"infinite loop\" due to a race condition when two threads access the same hashmap object.  For illustration purpose, let's consider the following scenario where two threads (Thread 1 and Thread 2) access a hash table without thread-safety\r\n\r\n- Thread 1 sees A.next = B, but then yields execution to Thread 2\r\n<img src=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13063040/13063040_hashtable1.png\" width=\"400\">\r\n\r\n- Thread 2 triggers a resize operation resulting in B.next = A (Note that hashmap doesn't care about ordering), and then yields execution to Thread 1.\r\n<img src=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13063041/13063041_hashtable2.png\" width=\"400\">\r\n\r\n- After taking over CPU, Thread 1 would run into an \"infinite loop\" when traversing the list in the last bucket, given A.next = B and B.next = A in its view.\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-21T00:39:35Z","updated_at":"2023-09-29T06:58:31Z","closed_at":"2023-09-29T03:54:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"817c6558ae28e1e3e9a40a7c45ed945f888ffc09","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43021/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43021/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43021/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d696d386798ea02db9e952dde914b6c3bef0ee6c","head":{"label":"xiongbo-sjtu:master","ref":"master","sha":"d696d386798ea02db9e952dde914b6c3bef0ee6c","user":{"login":"xiongbo-sjtu","id":94585875,"node_id":"U_kgDOBaNEEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94585875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongbo-sjtu","html_url":"https://github.com/xiongbo-sjtu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongbo-sjtu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongbo-sjtu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongbo-sjtu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongbo-sjtu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongbo-sjtu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongbo-sjtu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongbo-sjtu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongbo-sjtu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongbo-sjtu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":693950742,"node_id":"R_kgDOKVzZFg","name":"spark","full_name":"xiongbo-sjtu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiongbo-sjtu","id":94585875,"node_id":"U_kgDOBaNEEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94585875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongbo-sjtu","html_url":"https://github.com/xiongbo-sjtu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongbo-sjtu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongbo-sjtu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongbo-sjtu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongbo-sjtu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongbo-sjtu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongbo-sjtu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongbo-sjtu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongbo-sjtu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiongbo-sjtu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiongbo-sjtu/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn existing code, plan matching is used to validate if two CollectMetrics have the same name but different semantic. However, plan matching approach is fragile. A better way to tackle this is to just utilize the unique DataFrame Id. This is because observe API is only supported by DataFrame API. SQL does not have such syntax. \r\n\r\nSo two CollectMetric are semantic the same if and only if they have same name and same DataFrame id.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is to use a more stable approach to replace a fragile approach.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to

request?\r\n\r\nThis PR could be a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42488 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42557.\r\n\r\nIf there is an aggregate operator after the SMJ and the grouping expressions of aggregate operator contain all the join keys of the streamed side, we can add a sorter on the streamed side of the SMJ, so that the aggregate can be convert to a SortAggregate which will be faster than HashAggregate.\r\n\r\nFor example, with table t1(a, b, c) and t2(x, y, z):\r\n```\r\nSELECT a, b, sum(c)\r\nFROM t1\r\nJOIN t2\r\nON t1.b = t2.y\r\nGROUP BY a, b\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n```\r\nScan(t1)                Scan(t2)\r\n    |                      |\r\n    |                      |\r\nExchange 1           Exchange 2\r\n     \\                     /\r\n   Sort(t1.b)        Sort(t2.y) \r\n         \\             /\r\n       SMJ (t1.b = t2.y)\r\n                |\r\n                |\r\n         HashAggregate\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can change Sort(t1.b) to Sort(t1.b, t1.a) in the left side of the SMJ, and then the following aggregate could be convert to SortAggregate, which will be faster.\r\n\r\n```\r\nScan(t1)                Scan(t2)\r\n    |                      |\r\n    |                      |\r\nExchange 1           Exchange 2\r\n     \\                    /\r\n Sort(t1.b, t1.a)   Sort(t2.y) \r\n         \\             /\r\n      SMJ (t1.b = t2.y)\r\n                |\r\n                |\r\n          SortAggregate\r\n```\r\n\r\nBenchmark result\r\n```\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_281-b09 on Mac OS X

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe main purpose of this PR is to remove support for Scala 2.12 in Apache Spark 4.0, the specific work includes:\r\n\r\n1. Run `dev/change-scala-version.sh 2.13` to change the Scala version in all `pom.xml` files to 2.13\r\n2. Cleaned up the parent `pom.xml` configuration related to Scala 2.12 and set the Scala 2.13 configuration as the default\r\n3. Cleaned up the Scala 2.12 configuration in `SparkBuild.scala`\r\n4. Cleaned up the support for Scala 2.12 in `python/run-tests.py` and `dev/run-tests.py`\r\n5. Updated the sections related to Scala 2.12 in `docs/building-spark.md`, `docs/index.md`,`docs/spark-connect-overview.md`,`docs/storage-openstack-swift.md`,`docs/_config.yml` to Scala 2.13\r\n6. Updated the parts related to Scala 2.12 in `dev/test-dependencies.sh`, `dev/scalafmt`, `dev/mima`,`dev/lint-scala` to Scala 2.13\r\n7. Removed the support for Scala 2.12 in `dev/change-scala-version.sh` and cleaned up its invocation in Spark code\r\n8. Updated `dev/deps/spark-deps-hadoop-3-hive-2.3` and `LICENSE-binary`\r\n9. Removed task `scala-213` from `build_and_test.yml` because the daily test of other branches will not run this task, and the master branch already uses Scala 2.13 by default.\r\n10. Replaced Scala 2.12 with Scala 2.13 in the `name` of the following `.yml` files: `build_ansi.yml`, `build_coverage.yml`, `build_java11.yml`,`build_java17.yml`, `build_java21.yml`,`build_maven.yml`, and `build_rockdb_as_ui_backend.yml`\r\n11. Removed the support for Scala 2.12 in `benchmark.yml`\r\n12. Moved files from `src/scala-2.13/` directory to `src/main/scala` and deleted all files in the `src/scala-2.12/` directory.\r\n13. Comment out the code related to multiple Scala versions in `load-spark-env.cmd` and `load-spark-env.sh`.\r\n14. Clean up redundant `build-helper-maven-plugin` configurations from `core/pom.xml`, `repl/pom.xml`, `sql/api/pom.xml`, `sql/catalyst/pom.xml`, `sql/core/pom.xml` and `connector/connect/common/pom.xml`\r\n \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe minimum supported Scala version for Apache Spark 4.0 is Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, Apache will no longer support Scala 2.12\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to show the number of drivers waiting in `SUBMITTED` status in MasterPage.

versions.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**:\r\n```\r\nDrivers: 3 Running, 13 Completed\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**:\r\n```\r\nDrivers: 3 Running (1 Waiting), 13 Completed\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe main purpose of this pr is to remove support for Java 8 and Java 11 in Apache Spark 4.0, the specific work includes:\r\n1. `pom.xml`: change `java.version` from 1.8 to 17, change `target:jvm-1.8` to `target:17`\r\n2. `SparkBuild.scala`: change `-target:jvm-${javaVersion.value}` to `-target:${javaVersion.value}`\r\n3. workflow files: change the default Java version from 8 to 17, and ensure that branch-3.x still uses Java 8. Removed the daily job for Java 11 and Java 17.\r\n4. docs: replace parts of Java 8 and 11 with Java 17.\r\n5. `infra/Dockerfile`: change to install `openjdk-17-jdk-headless`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe minimum supported Java version for Apache Spark 4.0 is Java 17\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes,  Apache will no longer support Java 8 and Java 11\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass Github Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBefore this change, dynamic partition output files went through the following stages.\r\n\r\n1. Each task writes the files under a task specific directory. Each partition gets its own subdirectory. For example,  `finalLoc/.spark-staging-b8b7d3c4-6a75-4d17-8f60-e5ee13ebdfe2/_temporary/0/task_202309201700352612844563734165633_0000_m_000000`.\r\n2. In the commit phase, the task files are merged into an intermediate staging directory. For example,  `finalLoc/.spark-staging-b8b7d3c4-6a75-4d17-8f60-e5ee13ebdfe2`.\r\n3. For the updated partitions, the previous partition directories in the final output location are deleted. `partitions` file operations. This iterates over each partition directory. For example, `finalLoc/partition=a`.\r\n4. After the commit phase, each partition directory is moved from the staging to the final directory. `partitions` file operations. For example, `finalLoc/.spark-staging-b8b7d3c4-6a75-4d17-8f60-e5ee13ebdfe2/partition=a` to `finalLoc/partition=a`.\r\n\r\nThe only reason step 2 is needed is to make sure the new partition and old partition files are not mixed together. If the previous partitions are deleted before the commit then the intermediate staging directory is not required. The new dynamic partitions procedure is.\r\n\r\n1. Each task writes the files under a task specific directory. Each partition gets its own subdirectory. \r\n2. For the updated partitions, the previous partition directories in the final output location are deleted. \r\n3. In the commit phase, the task files are merged into the final directory. \r\n\r\nThis saves `count(partitions)` file operations.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is a performance optimization to minimize the number of file operations for dynamic partitions. This will decrease the commit phase time reduce the load on storage bottlenecks (e.g. HDFS namenodes).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRan all unit tests\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, `TransportClient.sendMergedBlockMetaReq` cannot guarantee that the  `onFailure` callback will be executed only once when the connection is disconnected. \r\nBy adding inflightMergedBlocks checks, we can avoid executing repeated fallbacks and data duplication.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn the `TransportClient.sendMergedBlockMetaReq` method,  the client lets `responseHandler` maintain  the callback for this request, In addition, it also adds a specified listener to the `channelFuture` of `writeAndFlush`. If the sending fails, the `onFailure` callback will be executed.\r\nWhen a shuffle client fetch push-merged block meta, if the channel happens to be closed at the same time, the two code paths will trigger two `onFailure` callbacks, one from the response handler and the other from the listener of channelFuture.  Two fallback will eventually cause the original block to be obtained twice.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd `SparkContext.setLogLevel(loggerName: String, logLevel: String)` to support change log level of specific package or class, it has below use cases:\r\n\r\n1. Change log level in runtime without restart spark driver or executor. One example is spark-shell.\r\n2. Save the effort to changing the log4j.properties on all host machines or passing long parameter in spark-submit to override log4j.properties.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, only support change log level of root logger, we may want to change log level of specific package or class\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, added below method in `SparkContext`\r\n```\r\ndef setLogLevel(loggerName: String, logLevel: String): Unit\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test in `UtilsSuite`\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-19T19:46:33Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:20:22Z","closed_at":"2024-01-15T00:20:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d2a71fbf07427498275d568474fd2174b2675b4e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1984361638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0MzYxNjM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/R","name":"R","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42999/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42999/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42999/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a18ea59a7ca0b4fd4bdc1d02c8e6854e95bff1cf","head":{"label":"warrenzhu25:log-level","ref":"log-level","sha":"a18ea59a7ca0b4fd4bdc1d02c8e6854e95bff1cf","user":{"login":"warrenzhu25","id":1633312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMzMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1633312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25","html_url":"https://github.com/warrenzhu25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":217627454,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTc2Mjc0NTQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"warrenzhu25/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"warrenzhu25","id":1633312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMzMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1633312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25","html_url":"https://github.com/warrenzhu25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/warrenzhu25/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes a bug regarding non-deterministic seeded Dataset functions.\r\n\r\nIf we run the following example the result is the expected equal 2 columns:\r\n```\r\nval c = rand()\r\ndf.select(c, c)\r\n\r\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+\r\n|rand(-4522010140232537566)|rand(-4522010140232537566)|\r\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+\r\n|        0.4520819282997137|        0.4520819282997137|\r\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if we run use other similar APIs their result is incorrect:\r\n```\r\nval r1 = random()\r\nval r2 = uuid()\r\nval r3 = shuffle(col(\"x\"))\r\nval x = df.select(r1, r1, r2, r2, r3, r3)\r\n\r\n+------------------+------------------+--------------------+--------------------+----------+----------+\r\n|            rand()|            rand()|              uuid()|              uuid()|shuffle(x)|shuffle(x)|\r\n+------------------+------------------+--------------------+--------------------+----------+----------+\r\n|0.7407604956381952|0.7957319451135009|e55bc4b0-74e6-4b0...|a587163b-d06b-4bb...| [1, 2, 3]| [2, 1, 3]|\r\n+------------------+------------------+--------------------+--------------------+----------+----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because the current implementation of `rand()` passes a random seed to `Rand`, but other functions like `random()`, `uuid()` and `shuffle()` don’t. Later the `ResolveRandomSeed` rule is adds the necessary seeds but since the resolution rules don’t track expression object identities they can’t map an expression object 2 times to the same transformed object. I.e. in case of `random()` the `UnresolvedFunction(\"random\", Seq.empty, ...)` object is transformed to 2 different `Rand(UnresolvedSeed)` objects and then 2 different random seeds are chosen.\r\n\r\nThis PR explicitely adds the seeds.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the above bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, fixes the above bug.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UT.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-09-19T13:47:15Z","updated_at":"2023-11-25T00:56:50Z","closed_at":"2023-09-21T00:36:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ac536c0c44e5bab648ef787dcbe677531fafc2af","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42997/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42997/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42997/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e9c54e6c9b3a4d9eda64746b70d922696c942cfa","head":{"label":"peter-toth:SPARK-45216-fix-non-deterministic-seeded","ref":"SPARK-45216-fix-non-deterministic-seeded","sha":"e9c54e6c9b3a4d9eda64746b70d922696c942cfa","user":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130546049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA1NDYwNDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"peter-toth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR enhances existing ClosureCleaner implementation to support cleaning closures defined in Ammonite. Please refer to [this gist](https://gist.github.com/vsevolodstep-db/b8e4d676745d6e2d047ecac291e5254c) to get more context on how Ammonite code wrapping works and what problems I'm trying to solve here.\r\n\r\nOverall, it contains these logical changes in `ClosureCleaner`:\r\n1. Making it recognize and clean closures defined in Ammonite (previously it was checking if capturing class name starts with `$line` and ends with `$iw`, which is native Scala REPL specific thing\r\n2. Making it clean closures if they are defined inside a user class in a REPL (see corner case 1 in the gist)\r\n3. Making it clean nested closures properly for Ammonite REPL (see corner case 2 in the gist)\r\n4. Making it transitively follow other Ammonite commands that are captured by the target closure.\r\n\r\nPlease note that `cleanTransitively` option of `ClosureCleaner.clean()` method refers to following references transitively within enclosing command object, but it doesn't follow other command objects.\r\n\r\nAs we need `ClosureCleaner` to be available in Spark Connect, I also moved the implementation to `common-utils` module. This brings a new `xbean-asm9-shaded` which is fairly small. \r\n\r\nAlso, this PR moves `checkSerializable` check from `ClosureCleaner` to `SparkClosureCleaner`, as it is specific to Spark core\r\n\r\nThe important changes affect `ClosureCleaner` only. They should not affect existing codepath for normal Scala closures / closures defined in a native Scala REPL and cover only closures defined in Ammonite.\r\n\r\nAlso,  this PR modifies SparkConnect's `UserDefinedFunction` to actually use `ClosureCleaner` and clean closures in SparkConnect\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo properly support closures defined in Ammonite, reduce UDF payload size and avoid possible `NonSerializable` exceptions. This includes:\r\n- lambda capturing outer command object, leading in a circular dependency\r\n- lambda capturing other command objects transitively, exploding payload size\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to remove unrecognized and meaningless command about `amm` from the GA testing workflow.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- When I observed GA's logs, I found the following logs:\r\n```\r\nRun # Fix for TTY related issues when launching the Ammonite REPL in tests.\r\nsh: 1: amm: not found\r\n```\r\neg:\r\n

`amm` did not recognize it. Through trial and error, it was found that the above command do not need to be executed in our GA.\r\n- Enhance maintainability and reduce misunderstandings.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to recover the availity of switching languages consistently across docs for all code snippets in Spark 3.4 and below by using the proper class selector in the JQuery. Previously the selector was a string `.nav-link tab_python` which did not comply multiple class selection: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#class-html. I assume it worked as a legacy behaviour somewhere. Now it uses the standard way `.nav-link.tab_python`.\r\n\r\nNote that https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42657 works because there's only single class assigned (after we refactored the site at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40269)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is a regression in our documentation site.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, once you click the language tab, it will apply to the examples in the whole page.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested after building the site.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 12 08 17 PM](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/6477701/09d0c117-9774-4404-8e2e-d454b7f700a3)\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWithout this change, there's no error handling in streaming python workers. The server side is [expecting](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/981312284f0776ca847c8d21411f74a72c639b22/connector/connect/server/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connect/planner/StreamingForeachBatchHelper.scala#L128-L129) 0 being written in [python worker's](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/981312284f0776ca847c8d21411f74a72c639b22/python/pyspark/sql/connect/streaming/worker/foreach_batch_worker.py#L73) output stream. But if any error is thrown in the worker, the 0 is not written anymore which would lead to an `EOFException` since we are trying to read from an empty stream.\r\n\r\nIf we remove the [lines](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/981312284f0776ca847c8d21411f74a72c639b22/connector/connect/server/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connect/planner/StreamingForeachBatchHelper.scala#L128-L129) reading python worker's output. The streaming query would succeed even if there's an error in foreachBatch function which is not the desired behavior we want.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, we are propagating the errors from Python worker to the server so it would fail the streaming query.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nExtend the raise_error() function to a two-argument version:\r\nraise_error(errorClassStr, errorParamMap)\r\nThis new form will accept any error class defined in error-classes.json and require Map<String, String> to provide values for the parameters in the error classes template.\r\nExternally an error raised via raise_error() is indistinguishable from an error raised from within the Spark engine.\r\n\r\nThe single-parameter raise_error(str) will raise USER_RAISED_EXCEPTION (SQLSTATE P0001 - borrowed from PostgreSQL).\r\nUSER_RAISED_EXCEPTION text is: \"<errorMessage>\" which will be filled in with the str - value.\r\n\r\nWe will also provide `spark.sql.legacy.raiseErrorWithoutErrorClass` (default: false) to revert to the old behavior for the single-parameter version.\r\n\r\nNaturally assert_true() will also return `USER_RAISED_EXCEPTION`.\r\n\r\n#### Examples\r\n```\r\nSELECT raise_error('VIEW_NOT_FOUND', map('relationName', '`v1`');\r\n  [VIEW_NOT_FOUND] The view `v1` cannot be found. Verify the spelling ...\r\n \r\nSELECT raise_error('Error!');\r\n  [USER_RAISED_EXCEPTION] Error!\r\n\r\nSELECT assert_true(1 < 0);\r\n [USER_RAISED_EXCEPTION] '(1 < 0)' is not true!\r\n \r\nSELECT assert_true(1 < 0, 'bad!')\r\n  [USER_RAISED_EXCEPTION] bad!\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis change moves raise_error() and assert_true() to the new error frame work.\r\nIt greatly expands the ability of users to raise error messages which can be intercepted via SQLSTATE and/or error class.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the result of assert_true() changes and raise_error() gains a new signature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nRun existing QA and add new tests for assert_true and raise_error\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdding a `CommandPluginWithQueryPlanningTracker` interface which extends the already existing `CommandPlugin` interface with a `process()` method that one can pass a `QueryPlanningTracker` to.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere is currently no way to track queries executed by a `CommandPlugin`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUsers now can also write trackable plugins by implementing the `CommandPluginWithQueryPlanningTracker`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen a `cast clause` was used in a column in a filter, it will not be able to push down. We can remove the cast from attribute side to support predicate push down if the cast not change the precision or range.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo use more predicate push down in query. For example:\r\n```sql\r\n-- dt is string type\r\nexplain select * from wechar_tbl where cast(dt as date) = date_sub(current_date(), 1);\r\n```\r\n- Before this patch\r\n```bash\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) ColumnarToRow\r\n+- FileScan parquet default.wechar_tbl[id#5,name#6,dt#7] Batched: true, DataFilters: [], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex(0 paths)[], PartitionFilters: [isnotnull(dt#7), (cast(dt#7 as date) = 2023-09-17)], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<id:int,name:string>\r\n```\r\n**(cast(dt#7 as date) = 2023-09-17) can not be push down in partition filter**\r\n- After this patch\r\n```bash\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) ColumnarToRow\r\n+- FileScan parquet default.wechar_tbl[id#62,name#63,dt#64] Batched: true, DataFilters: [], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex[], PartitionFilters: [isnotnull(dt#64), (dt#64 = 2023-09-17)], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<id:int,name:string>\r\n```\r\n**(dt#64 = 2023-09-17) can be push down in partition filter**\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd unit test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr changes the assume condition of two Python related test cases in the 'SparkConnectSessionHodgerSuite' from `assume(IntegratedUDFTestUtils.shouldTestPythonUDFs)` to `assume(IntegratedUDFTestUtils.shouldTestPandasUDFs)`. These two test cases are: \r\n- `python foreachBatch process: process terminates after query is stopped`\r\n- `python listener process: process terminates after listener is removed`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMaven daily test failed due to not installing Pandas:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to make `StandaloneRestServer` add `JavaModuleOptions` to drivers by default.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince Apache Spark 3.3.0 (SPARK-36796, #34153), `SparkContext` adds `JavaModuleOptions` by default.\r\n\r\nWe had better add `JavaModuleOptions` when `StandaloneRestServer` receives submissions via REST

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCherry-pick of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42929\r\n\r\nPreviously the Python client would not call `release_all` after fetching all results and leaving the query dangling. The query would then be removed after the five minute timeout.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds proper testing for calling release all and release until.\r\n\r\nIn addition it fixes a test race condition where we would close the SparkSession which would in turn close the GRPC channel which might have dangling async release calls hanging.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nStability\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nnew UT\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2023-09-18T07:32:32Z","updated_at":"2023-09-18T23:32:33Z","closed_at":"2023-09-18T23:32:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"297e254e2b778cc2dce0f28452d1304d1a0a99cf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42973/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42973/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42973/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/007048ea7217a245cb6cd57aeca04bdb5d3769a7","head":{"label":"grundprinzip:SPARK-45167-3.5","ref":"SPARK-45167-3.5","sha":"007048ea7217a245cb6cd57aeca04bdb5d3769a7","user":{"login":"grundprinzip","id":3421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip","html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":503900825,"node_id":"R_kgDOHgjqmQ","name":"spark","full_name":"grundprinzip/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"grundprinzip","id":3421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip","html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42929 that:\r\n- Use lighter threading `Rlock` instead of multithreading `Rlock`. Multiprocessing does not work with PySpark due to the ser/de problem for socket connections, and many others.\r\n- Use the existing eventually util function `pyspark.testing.eventually` instead of `assertEventually` to deduplicate code.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMainly for code clean-up.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should pass them.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-09-18T00:03:13Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:48:13Z","closed_at":"2023-09-18T04:46:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"de3c8c1bc8be9a689848112ac6e49866d5f8a4ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42965/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42965/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42965/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7d33f4cd4614b3353db8972de47ba2114f2e6414","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-45167-followup","ref":"SPARK-45167-followup","sha":"7d33f4cd4614b3353db8972de47ba2114f2e6414","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to use the same pattern for `logPage` urls of `WorkerPage` to make it work consistently when `spark.ui.reverseProxy=true`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince Apache Spark 3.2.0 (SPARK-34635, #31753), Apache Spark adds trailing slashes to reduce redirections for `logPage`.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n      s\"$workerUrlRef/logPage?driverId=$driverId&logType=stdout\")\r\n      s\"$workerUrlRef/logPage/?driverId=$driverId&logType=stdout\")\r\n...\r\n<a href={s\"$workerUrlRef/logPage?appId=${executor\r\n<a href={s\"$workerUrlRef/logPage/?appId=${executor\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix a leftover in `WorkerPage` to make it work consistently in case of the reverse proxy situation via `spark.ui.reverseProxy`. Currently,  in some proxy environments, `appId` link is working but `driverId` link is broken due to the redirections. This inconsistent behavior makes the users confused.\r\n\r\n```\r\n-        <a href={s\"$workerUrlRef/logPage?driverId=${driver.driverId}&logType=stdout\"}>stdout</a>\r\n-        <a href={s\"$workerUrlRef/logPage?driverId=${driver.driverId}&logType=stderr\"}>stderr</a>\r\n+        <a href={s\"$workerUrlRef/logPage/?driverId=${driver.driverId}&logType=stdout\"}>stdout</a>\r\n+        <a href={s\"$workerUrlRef/logPage/?driverId=${driver.driverId}&logType=stderr\"}>stderr</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual tests because it requires a reverse proxy.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-09-17T08:51:12Z","updated_at":"2023-09-17T17:36:05Z","closed_at":"2023-09-17T17:34:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b6c19d6efbc16293461df2e0cf0fb752d3a0a358","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to correct the message for JVM only tests from Spark Connect, and enable the tests when possible to workaround without JVM features.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAmong JVM-dependent tests, there are tests that can be replaced without using JVM features, while there are some edge tests that can only be tested using JVM features. We need to be clearer about why these cannot be tested.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. it's test-only\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated the existing tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-09-16T09:07:53Z","updated_at":"2023-11-20T01:36:37Z","closed_at":"2023-09-18T16:03:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"511a43ae21e6d55cdb639b6c20a0bcc080da5071","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS
