Users can specify a path to the `py` file which is located in GCS bucket and then the operator will download this file to the local system. In the current deferrable mode implementation operator downloads `py` file before going to the deferrable mode. It means that on a distributed system the file is downloaded on the `worker` machine not on the `trigger` machine. And then when the operator tries to execute a Job on the `trigger` machine Airflow throws an error that the executable `py` file does not exist.\r\n\r\nFix for the same issue for the `BeamRunJavaPipelineOperator`: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/39371\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the

normal use (i.e. running `airflow scheduler`) this doesn't matter as the\nprocess is about to exit.\n\nHowever this can come up in running tests -- for instance if you try to run\n`pytest tests/jobs/test_scheduler_job.py tests/executors/` it will fail as the\nsignal handler from running the scheduler is still installed in the main\npytest process.\n\nSince the fix is easy and doesn't significantly complicate anything it is\nworth making the behaviour under pytest more \"correct\".\n\n<!--\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n or more contributor license

#42513 and #42514.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is to send events to assets when some watchers are associated to them. Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntrigger = MyQueueTrigger(queue=\"<my_queue>\")\r\nasset = Asset(\"test_asset\", watchers=[trigger])\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=\"example\",\r\n    schedule=[asset],\r\n):\r\n    task = EmptyOperator(task_id=\"task\",)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs part of AIP-82, it is now possible to associate `watchers` to an asset. These watchers are triggers. By associating a trigger to an asset, whenever the trigger fires, the goal is to update the asset. This PR handles that part, when a trigger fires, it updates its associated triggers.\r\n\r\nI also updated the logic behind how the triggers are cleaned up by the triggerer. These triggers that are associated to an assets long as long as the association between the trigger and the asset is defined in the DAG.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

primary drivers of this are simplification, specifically:\n\n1. It avoids global state -- which makes things easier to reason about. For\n   instance this removes the use of `reload()` in our tests; a sure sign that\n   things are overly complicated\n2. It removes the wierd \"mixed\" source of truth inside SchedulerJob, where\n   some places were still looking at `self.job.executors` while others were\n   looking at ExecutorLoader.load_executor directly\n\n`set_default_executor` was removed as nothing called it.\n\nThe comment about  \"Cache this executor by name here, so we can look it up\nlater if it is requested again, and not have to construct a new object\" is\nmoot as the SchedulerJob is the only thing that has persistent executor\nobjects, and `self.job.executors` is already that cache.\n\n<!--\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n or more contributor license agreements.

My use case here is I'm running DBT in kpo, and I want to do multiple things to the DBT artefacts after the DBT job has run, I could use `on_manifest_finalization` to insert an alpine sidecar with volumes mounted with the same intention as the XCom sidecar, where the sidecar keeps the volumes alive as files are extracted from it.  `on_pod_wrapup` would allow me to insert a single sidecar and have multiple callbacks run their `on_pod_completion` before `on_pod_wrapup` kills the

PR handle missing DAGs when clearing task instances to prevent failures. When we delete DAG files and attempt to trigger them again, the process should access the DAGs and display an error indicating that the DAGs no longer exist, rather than causing the frontend to show an \"Oops\" error.\r\n\r\n### Summary of Changes:\r\n- Added warning logs for missing DAGs to prevent silent failures during task clearing.\r\n- Improved error handling for downstream task clearing, including checks for partial_subset errors to handle cases where DAGs or downstream dependencies are unavailable.\r\n- Updated the docstring for _clear_task_instances for better clarity and consistent style.\r\n- Refined the grouping and handling of Task Instances by DAG and DAG Run to improve robustness and maintainability.\r\n\r\n### Issue Reference:\r\nCloses #44274\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

improvements:\r\n- Redirection URL is changed to use the legacy `login` endpoint for now. At the moment the new API does not expose any `/login` route, and the current redirection will cause a plain `404`. (We can swap that back later when the new login endpoint is implemented)\r\n\r\n- Do not handle 403. Permissions errors mean that the user is authenticated and recognized, he just does not have permission to do that. In that case redirecting him to `/login` does not serve any purpose as the user is already authenticated. We should instead handle the `403` and display an appropriate message to the User.","created_at":"2024-11-25T10:42:23Z","updated_at":"2024-11-25T13:08:40Z","closed_at":"2024-11-25T13:08:37Z","merged_at":"2024-11-25T13:08:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"074c822c6a1ddbd6f2d8129743a290cf1d0fe607","assignee":{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jscheffl","id":95105677,"node_id":"U_kgDOBasyjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95105677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl","html_url":"https://github.com/jscheffl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"http

compatibility tests started to fail after Pydantic 2.10.0/2.10.1 have been released due to change in the way they are handling base classes for Pydantic classes and their protected members, when the base class uses PEP 563 ('from __future__ import annotations`) on Python 3.8 / 3.9.\r\n\r\nThis is tracked in https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/10958 and hopefully will be solved by adding eval-type-backport as required Pydantic 2.10.2+ dependency, but until it is released, manually installing `eval-type-backport` in compatibility tests should workaround the failing canary tests.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR adds an `adapter` parameter to the `HttpHook`, allowing users to mount custom adapters for HTTP request handling. This enhances flexibility and supports use cases like custom retries, timeouts, and SSL handling.\r\n\r\n### Summary of Changes:\r\n- Added `adapter` parameter to `HttpHook` to allow custom HTTP adapters.\r\n- Modified `get_conn` to support mounting custom adapters or using TCPKeepAliveAdapter by default.\r\n- Added comprehensive tests to validate the functionality of the `adapter` parameter and its integration with `get_conn`.\r\n- Ensured all new tests pass and maintain compatibility with existing functionality.\r\n\r\n### Issue Reference:\r\nCloses #44285\r\n\r\n### Testing and Validation:\r\n- Added unit tests in `~/providers/tests/http/hooks/test_http.py` to validate:\r\n  - Mounting custom adapters.\r\n  - Default behavior when no adapter is provided.\r\n  - Handling invalid adapter types.\r\n- Ran `pytest providers/tests/http/hooks/test_http.py` using breeze.\r\n- Pass `pre-commit run --files providers/src/airflow/providers/http/hooks/http.py providers/tests/http/hooks/test_http.py` using breeze.\r\n\r\n### Backward Compatibility:\r\nThis change is backward-compatible. The new `adapter` parameter is optional and defaults to None, preserving existing behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

#44245\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Cause\r\nThe query for fetching the stats of task instances groups them by `task_id`, `run_id`, `state`, and `try_number`. However, using `try_number` for dynamic mapped tasks leads to incorrect results as individual tasks within the mapping might have different `try_number` values.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\nLet's say that within a dynamic mapped task there were 10 expansions - 4 of them failed in the first time and reran (i.e., `try_number = 2`).\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/184cd72f-fc0e-43f3-a0d1-a6429d16954f)\r\n\r\nIn this case, the API response will eventually show only statistics regarding the most recent `try_number`.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07a27c8a-af6c-4aef-8593-d5f18daf6473)\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]  \r\n> Intermediate results might not exactly follow the latter pattern, as they also depend on the \r\n> `TaskInstance.state` parameter of the `group_by`. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nIn the query, avoid grouping by `try_number` only for dynamic mapped tasks (`map_index != -1`).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

I just released Ruff 0.8.0. This release removes a few rules that had been deprecated for a few releases, so Ruff 0.8.0 would have started emitting warnings when linting trio due to the fact that you have some of these now-removed rules explicitly ignored in your Ruff config.\r\n\r\nThis PR gets rid of the removed rules from your Ruff config. There's also some additional changes made here; let me know if any of them are undesirable, and I can revert them:\r\n- The `flake8-type-checking` rules have been recoded from `TCH` to `TC`; I updated `noqa` comments and configuration settings related to these so that they use the new error codes\r\n- `dev/breeze/src/airflow_breeze/utils/console.py` was changed slightly due to autofix for UP015, which has been improved in the latest release\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

Add EmptyOperator with @task.empty decorator\r\n\r\n## Objective\r\nThis PR introduces a new operator called `EmptyOperator` with support for the `@task.empty` decorator. This operator serves as a placeholder for tasks in DAGs that do not have any execution logic but are useful for defining the structure of the workflow.\r\n\r\n## Key Changes\r\n- Created `airflow/decorators/empty.py` with the implementation of `EmptyOperator` and the `@task.empty` decorator.\r\n- Modified `airflow/decorators/__init__.pyi` to expose the new `empty` decorator.\r\n- Added functionality to capture `args/kwargs` and log custom messages when executing tasks decorated with `@task.empty`.\r\n\r\n## Example Usage\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow.decorators import dag, task\r\nfrom airflow.utils.dates import days_ago\r\n\r\n@dag(schedule_interval=None, start_date=days_ago(1), catchup=False)\r\ndef my_empty_dag():\r\n    @task.empty\r\n    def start_task():\r\n        print(\"This is a placeholder start task.\")\r\n\r\n    @task.empty\r\n    def end_task():\r\n        print(\"This is a placeholder end task.\")\r\n\r\n    start_task() >> end_task()\r\n\r\ndag =

I've come across cases at work where not setting this returns unexpected results, whereas setting it to True (via a workaround) returns the expected results.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I think there is a valid case for allowing this to be passed via connection arguments (via `extra`).\r\n\r\n[Relevant 'upstream' Snowflake connector
