Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis update includes several improvements:\r\n\r\n* Enhanced schema updates sync using the Avro schema converter from the Java DataHub client.\r\n* Table sync now includes:\r\n  - Basic Hudi table properties\r\n  - Partitioning information\r\n  - User-defined properties\r\n  - Spark-related properties\r\n  - Parent container (database) details\r\n  - Additional information such as status, subtype, and browse path\r\n  - Optionally, attach a domain object\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis update significantly enhances the integration by providing richer information.\r\n\r\n### Risk Level\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\nThe end-to-end testing was successfully completed locally by running a Spark application and verifying the output in the DataHub UI.\r\n\r\n**Command:**\r\n   \r\n```shell\r\nspark-submit \\\r\n    --master \"local[*]\" --driver-memory 2g \\\r\n    --jars 'packaging/hudi-spark-bundle/target/hudi-spark3.5-bundle_2.12-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar,packaging/hudi-datahub-sync-bundle/target/hudi-datahub-sync-bundle-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar'\\\r\n    --conf 'spark.serializer=org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer' \\\r\n    --conf 'spark.sql.extensions=org.apache.spark.sql.hudi.HoodieSparkSessionExtension' \\\r\n    --conf

--version 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn case of errors, only the DataHub metadata sync is impacted.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n- [x] Update docs in https://hudi.apache.org/docs/syncing_datahub/ with PR #12504\r\n\r\n### Contributor's Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through the [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added, if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR simplifies precombine and ordering field value handling in the file group reader by assuming that the precombine field should not be changed after table creation, i.e., both the field name and type should not be changed.  All the type cast logic specifically for ordering value is removed.\r\n\r\nIf the user does want to change the precombine or ordering field in rare cases, we should advise them to compact the table fully first, and then change the table config through a special process through Hudi CLI for example.  After this PR, such a process can still work as the precombine and ordering value comparison only happens when merging records from base and log files.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSimplify precombine and ordering field value handling in the file group reader and avoids hidden mishandling of precombine and ordering value comparion.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn Hudi, when scheduling Compaction, the default behavior is to scan all partitions under the current table. When there are many historical partitions, such as 640,000 in our production environment, this scanning and planning operation becomes very inefficient. For Flink, it often leads to checkpoint timeouts, resulting in data delays. This PR introduces the ability to schedule Compaction for incremental partitions. In the StreamOperatorCoordinator, it adds:\r\n\r\n1. A state variable `lastInstant` to record the delta commit instant corresponding to the last successfully completed Compaction schedule, and it is saved with the state.\r\n2. A temporary variable `cacheWrittenPartitions` to cache the incremental partitions corresponding to all delta commits from the last scheduled Compaction to the present.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1494\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f7de73d-30ad-4411-ba08-28386ff549f4\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe made a fix to an issue that fails Flink 1.20 bundle build in the release script which was not caught by CI: #12432 .  The root cause is that CI build is not consistent with the release script, specifically the `avro.version` set.  This PR fixes the GH CI to be consistent with the release script by setting the `avro.version` per supported Flink version.\r\n\r\nAfter fixing the build command CI and testing against the POM before the fix, now CI throws build error as expected:\r\n<img width=\"1823\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-06 at 21 20 06\"

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Update the default parallelism to be based off of the base files that will be read instead of input data partitions\r\n- Update the key lookup to use iterators instead of materializing a full list first\r\n- Added unit tests\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n- Small updates against a large table will struggle with the current defaults since the number of input partitions is small relative to the total number of files that need to be inspected.\r\n- We use iterators now instead of creating an intermediate list object which is preferred in spark\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Disables `HoodieSparkFileGroupReaderBasedMergeHandle` for log compaction;\r\n- Adds complete log reading stats to the file group reader and the write stat from `HoodieSparkFileGroupReaderBasedMergeHandle`;\r\n- Fixes `TestMetadataUtilRLIandSIRecordGeneration#testRecordGenerationAPIsForCOW` to correctly set up the table with the precombine field.\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen there is a pending compaction, the new base files to be generated by compaction is not available during this transaction. Given the log files in MOR from this transaction can be attached to the base file generated by the compaction in the latest file slice, the accurate record positions may not be derived. This PR disables WRITE_RECORD_POSITIONS in this case to avoid incorrect merging results, as the log merging has not accounted for this yet.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAvoid correctness issue on record

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen the checkpoint is not given, the initial one is created with default start time: \"00000000000000\".\r\nSince there is no completion time for it, the translation fails.\r\n\r\nWhen we meet this kind of checkpoint, we should just return the correct checkpoint with the same time.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFix a bug.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nDuring the landing Hudi lakehouse technology at JD, we encountered issues with the instability of the shared HDFS cluster, which led to frequent timeouts and restarts of Flink ingestion tasks, significantly affecting the performance and stability of data ingestion. To address this issue, we developed a solution based on the open-source community version, similar to RFC-60's Federated Storage Layout. This allows Hudi to support multiple pluggable physical storage systems and build logical table views on top of them, exposing these logical views externally.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79cf28c3-fa0b-47f6-af97-e42ce582ae04)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Based on this design, we implemented a cache layer capability for hudi tables, where hot data is first written to a high-performance, dedicated small HDFS cluster to ensure strong performance and stability.** \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49cd3a50-2d9f-456e-80c5-ae6208b87f57)\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsequently, through modified Clustering/Compaction table services, we achieve the migration of data from the cache layer to the persistent layer while organizing hudi table data.\r\n\r\n**_The implementation has shown significant results and has been successfully deployed to production, enduring multiple rounds of challenges during major shopping festivals like 618 and 11.11 (similar to Black Friday)_**. \r\n\r\nFor instance, in JD's traffic data ingestion business, with a single table containing 180 fields:\r\n\r\nAfter enabling JD's Federated Storage Layout sourced from PRD env:\r\n\r\n1. Flink writing performance(5000C) improved by 150%, reaching 770 million records per minute .\r\n2. Consumption throughput reached 27 GB/s.\r\n3. Flink checkpoint duration improved 90.3% from 31.8s to 3s\r\n4. Flink stability improved by 97%.\r\n5. Data freshness was optimized from T+1 to a minute-level.\r\n\r\nHere is PRD monitor \r\n<img width=\"1549\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89c654f6-b5c8-4b1d-aa54-18880bc47c7a\">\r\n\r\nHere is our benchmark result using 2000C\r\n\r\n<img width=\"849\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9404c789-08d7-4257-9f6f-9df8d2771a1c\">\r\n\r\nThis has comprehensively enhanced the user experience of traffic data utilization.\r\n\r\nAfter discussions with Ethan and CTTY, we are collaboratively building the Open Source Federated Storage Layout. Based on my production experience, I have provided some improvement suggestions regarding interface design, engine integration methods, etc. Please review.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\nWhen a corrupted block appears at the end of a Log file, the Trino Reader (LogScanner) fails to read it. This is because Hudi attempts to use InputStream#seek to locate the end of the LogBlock to check for corruption. However, Trino's TrinoInputStream#seek does not necessarily throw an EOFException when seeking beyond the end of the file. In some file systems, such as AzureInputStream#seek and so on, it may throw an IOException, not an EOFException.\r\n\r\n#### Why do we need this PR ?\r\nThe Trino issue is not unique, we might encounter custom InputStreams that encapsulate their own exception classes in reader. Therefore, we compare the position obtained from InputStream#getPos with the file length to determine if the end of the file has been reached\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFix Trino failure when reading

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIndexing catchup task iterates over all the commits to sync them to MDT. It will periodically check if the commit completed. But if the commit actually failed then it will forever be in inflight mode and hence the indexing run will not progress. This PR fixes the issue by using heartbeat to detect failed commits and ignore them. Without the change in `awaitInstantCaughtUp`, the new test `testHeartbeatExpired` will fail.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nIndexer can be used even with pending/failed commits.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI
