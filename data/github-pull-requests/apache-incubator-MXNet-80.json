this an alternative approach to getting TensorCore working with FullyConnected.  It is far simpler than my first PR for this new functionality.  If anything, this is my proof that one can invoke TensorCore algos through manipulation of the cublas handle along with the existing dot function's use of Hgemm and SgemmEx.  This PR also shows the type of per-instance handle manipulations that are necessary, since blindly setting the handle globally to enable TensorCore will have the unfortunate side-effect of introducing fp16-casts on the inputs of fp32-I/O gemms.  Bottom line, I wouldn't expect you to accept this PR without a discussion.\r\n\r\nI have begun studying the new linear algebra code with the idea of producing an enable-TensorCore PR for this new approach.  I notice the new LA code doesn't support fp16 I/O gemms yet, and the solution there will not fit the mold of the existing function templates.  Also, what is the plan for switching over MXNET's use of dot() to use the new functions?","created_at":"2017-08-14T01:28:16Z","updated_at":"2017-08-18T01:49:08Z","closed_at":"2017-08-18T01:49:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2cc0339299307dcca1d264808d3a288b913182e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/7447/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/7447/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7447/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/c6bc50804a5eb4cd10a93d9644fa273a96d41017","head":{"label":"DickJC123:tensorcore_fullyconnected_support2","ref":"tensorcore_fullyconnected_support2","sha":"c6bc50804a5eb4cd10a93d9644fa273a96d41017","user":{"login":"DickJC123","id":1703397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123","html_url":"https://github.com/DickJC123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86116214,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NjExNjIxNA==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"DickJC123/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DickJC123","id":1703397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123","html_url":"https://github.com/DickJC123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DickJC123/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Usually for recommender systems, we don't want to compute the overall precision, but only, say precision@10, because only 10 items might be shown to the user. It makes sense to optimize your model that gets the top entries right, sacrificing overall precision. Similar arguments hold for recall, coverage etc. Having such a standard metric available in MXNet will let more people in the ML community make use of it, and increase it's adoptation.
