Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [ ] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License

the @Qualifier annotation to the RequestMappingHandlerMapping dependency\r\n\r\nFixes #1879 \r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [x] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [ ] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

We will not remove the constants, but we recommend using <code>StandardCharsets</code> for consistency. (45e6be2688)</li>\n<li><code>base</code>: Added <code>ToStringHelper.omitEmptyValues()</code>. (f5ec2ab85c)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Added an optimized <code>copyOf</code> method to <code>TreeRangeMap</code>. (a46565dd1c)</li>\n<li><code>collect.testing</code>: Fixed <code>@Require</code> annotations so that features implied by absent features are not also required to be absent. (81be061f85)</li>\n<li><code>io</code>: Changed <code>ByteSink</code> and <code>CharSink</code> to no longer call <code>flush()</code> in some cases before <code>close()</code>. This is a no-op for well-behaved streams, which internally flush their data as part of closing. However, we have discovered some stream implementations that have overridden <code>close()</code> to do nothing, including not to flush some buffered data. If this change causes problems, the simplest fix is usually to change the <code>close()</code> override to at least call <code>flush()</code>. (6ace8bc8ea)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Added <code>HttpHeaders.ALT_SVC</code> and <code>MediaType.CBOR</code>.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [x] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

[org.jsoup:jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup) from 1.18.1 to 1.18.2.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/releases\">org.jsoup:jsoup's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>jsoup 1.18.2</h2>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Optimized the throughput and memory use throughout the input read and parse flows, with heap allocations and GC  down between -6% and -89%, and throughput improved up to +143% for small inputs. Most inputs sizes will see  throughput increases of ~ 20%. These performance improvements come through recycling the backing <code>byte[]</code> and <code>char[]</code>  arrays used to read and parse the input. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2186\">2186</a></li>\n<li>Speed optimized <code>html()</code> and <code>Entities.escape()</code> when the input contains UTF characters in a supplementary plane, by around 49%. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2183\">2183</a></li>\n<li>The form associated elements returned by <code>FormElement.elements()</code> now reflect changes made to the DOM, subsequently to the original parse. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2140\">2140</a></li>\n<li>In the <code>TreeBuilder</code>, the <code>onNodeInserted()</code> and <code>onNodeClosed()</code> events are now also fired for the outermost / root <code>Document</code> node. This enables source position tracking on the Document node (which was previously unset). And it also enables the node traversor to see the outer Document node. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2182\">2182</a></li>\n<li>Selected Elements can now be position swapped inline using <code>Elements#set()</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2212\">2212</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Element.cssSelector()</code> would fail if the element's class contained a <code>*</code>  character. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2169\">2169</a></li>\n<li>When tracking source ranges, a text node following an invalid self-closing element may be left untracked. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2175\">2175</a></li>\n<li>When a document has no doctype, or a doctype not named <code>html</code>, it should be parsed in Quirks Mode. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2197\">2197</a></li>\n<li>With a selector like <code>div:has(span + a)</code>, the <code>has()</code> component was not working correctly, as the inner combining query caused the evaluator to match those against the outer's siblings, not  children. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2187\">2187</a></li>\n<li>A selector query that included multiple <code>:has()</code> components in a nested <code>:has()</code> might incorrectly execute. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2131\">2131</a></li>\n<li>When cookie names in a response are duplicated, the simple view of cookies available via <code>Connection.Response#cookies()</code> will provide the last one set. Generally it is better to use the <a href=\"https://jsoup.org/cookbook/web/request-session\">Jsoup.newSession</a> method to maintain a cookie jar, as that applies appropriate path selection on cookies when making requests. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1831\">1831</a></li>\n<li>When parsing named HTML entities, base entities should resolve if they are a prefix of the input token (and not in an attribute). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2207\">2207</a></li>\n<li>Fixed incorrect tracking of source ranges for attributes merged from late-occurring elements that were implicitly created (<code>html</code> or <code>body</code>). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2204\">2204</a></li>\n<li>Follow the current HTML specification in the tokenizer to allow <code>&lt;</code> as part of a tag name, instead of emitting it as a character node. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2230\">2230</a></li>\n<li>Similarly, allow a <code>&lt;</code> as the start of an attribute name, vs creating a new element. The previous behavior was intended to parse closer to what we anticipated the author's intent to be, but that does not align to the spec or to how browsers behave. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1483\">1483</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/CHANGES.md\">org.jsoup:jsoup's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>1.18.2 (2024-Nov-27)</h2>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Optimized the throughput and memory use throughout the input read and parse flows, with heap allocations and GC\ndown between -6% and -89%, and throughput improved up to +143% for small inputs.

These performance improvements come through recycling the backing <code>byte[]</code> and <code>char[]</code>\narrays used to read and parse the input. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2186\">2186</a></li>\n<li>Speed optimized <code>html()</code> and <code>Entities.escape()</code> when the input contains UTF characters in a supplementary plane, by\naround 49%. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2183\">2183</a></li>\n<li>The form associated elements returned by <code>FormElement.elements()</code> now reflect changes made to the DOM,\nsubsequently to the original parse. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2140\">2140</a></li>\n<li>In the <code>TreeBuilder</code>, the <code>onNodeInserted()</code> and <code>onNodeClosed()</code> events are now also fired for the outermost /\nroot <code>Document</code> node. This enables source position tracking on the Document node (which was previously unset). And\nit also enables the node traversor to see the outer Document node. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2182\">2182</a></li>\n<li>Selected Elements can now be position swapped inline using\n<code>Elements#set()</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2212\">2212</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Element.cssSelector()</code> would fail if the element's class contained a <code>*</code>\ncharacter. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2169\">2169</a></li>\n<li>When tracking source ranges, a text node following an invalid self-closing element may be left\nuntracked. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2175\">2175</a></li>\n<li>When a document has no doctype, or a doctype not named <code>html</code>, it should be parsed in Quirks\nMode. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2197\">2197</a></li>\n<li>With a selector like <code>div:has(span + a)</code>, the <code>has()</code> component was not working correctly, as the inner combining\nquery caused the evaluator to match those against the outer's siblings, not\nchildren. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2187\">2187</a></li>\n<li>A selector query that included multiple <code>:has()</code> components in a nested <code>:has()</code> might incorrectly\nexecute. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2131\">2131</a></li>\n<li>When cookie names in a response are duplicated, the simple view of cookies available via\n<code>Connection.Response#cookies()</code> will provide the last one set. Generally it is better to use\nthe <a href=\"https://jsoup.org/cookbook/web/request-session\">Jsoup.newSession</a> method to maintain a cookie jar, as that\napplies appropriate path selection on cookies when making requests. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1831\">1831</a></li>\n<li>When parsing named HTML entities, base entities should resolve if they are a prefix of the input token (and not in an\nattribute). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2207\">2207</a></li>\n<li>Fixed incorrect tracking of source ranges for attributes merged from late-occurring elements that were implicitly\ncreated (<code>html</code> or <code>body</code>). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2204\">2204</a></li>\n<li>Follow the current HTML specification in the tokenizer to allow <code>&lt;</code> as part of a tag name, instead of emitting it as a\ncharacter node. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2230\">2230</a></li>\n<li>Similarly, allow a <code>&lt;</code> as the start of an attribute name, vs creating a new element. The previous behavior was\nintended to parse closer to what we anticipated the author's intent to be, but that does not align to the spec or to\nhow browsers behave. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1483\">1483</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/71063c3d4bb4bcc83c4655bdf6347ce2f5670a7c\"><code>71063c3</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release jsoup-1.18.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/1a91aac56176edcb2327569feb5aff5282f8cacb\"><code>1a91aac</code></a> Use the incoming node's parent if outgoing has already been removed</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/df404cf5ac12fb295e8abd9e05de1dcbcea30657\"><code>df404cf</code></a> test case for Issue <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2212\">#2212</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/28db617354cc2ed60a8b978865e71e5d7c6b6224\"><code>28db617</code></a> Test for <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1938\">#1938</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/d27370ac7ecd7eee843b3153c81f44e46b4ef63c\"><code>d27370a</code></a> Follow spec so <code>&lt;</code> can start an attribute name</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/0ef4b70b2acf47c1094aedbb9954324a2e84c05e\"><code>0ef4b70</code></a> Allow <code>&lt;</code> in tag name state</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/51909b1af727eea21bc011633519e31aaff82048\"><code>51909b1</code></a> Tweak HTML javadoc <code>&gt;</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/91b5a56c63a9f8dca761b4cab959977fcd3308fd\"><code>91b5a56</code></a> Copy attribute source range when merging attributes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/5ee376bc5bbe6a4f66eb24e2180552b547b8a4bf\"><code>5ee376b</code></a> Entity decoding supports prefix matches</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/708fc1fc5e41b8bb02d0ce15a9da8086f6bdb9dd\"><code>708fc1f</code></a> Make And and Or constructors public</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/compare/jsoup-1.18.1...jsoup-1.18.2\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=org.jsoup:jsoup&package-manager=maven&previous-version=1.18.1&new-version=1.18.2)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [ ] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License

CI to build on JDK 23 instead of 22\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [ ] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under
