We can perform other operations during the waiting time or send more requests to Metadata.\r\n\r\nSQLAlchemy supports since 1.4 [Asynchronous I/O (asyncio)](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/extensions/asyncio.html) that we can use to improve all our components:\r\n- improving scheduler logic\r\n- improving the async execution in the executors\r\n- making the Triggerer fully asynchronous\r\n- loading variables/connections asynchronously in the triggers and the async hooks.\r\n- and, of course, improving the performance of our API and webserver, which will serve much more users with lower resource usage.\r\n\r\nTo test and validate the efficiency of async sessions before merging complicated methods from sync to async, I implemented the utils to create the async sessions and some async methods to load the variables and the connections from the database, and I tried  one of the newly implemented methods with the triggerer:\r\n\r\ntest_trigger.py:\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Any\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.triggers.base import BaseTrigger\r\n\r\n\r\nclass TestTrigger(BaseTrigger):\r\n\r\n    def serialize(self) -> tuple[str, dict[str, Any]]:\r\n        return \"airflow.test_trigger.TestTrigger\", {}\r\n\r\n    async def run(self):\r\n        import asyncio\r\n\r\n        from airflow.models.connection import Connection\r\n\r\n        for _ in range(1000):\r\n            conn = await Connection.async_get_connection_from_secrets(\"airflow_db\")\r\n            self.log.info(conn.login)\r\n            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)\r\n        yield {}\r\n```\r\ndag.py:\r\n```python\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\nfrom airflow.models.dag import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.models.operator import BaseOperator\r\nfrom airflow.test_trigger import TestTrigger\r\n\r\n\r\nclass TestOperator(BaseOperator):\r\n    def __init__(self, param: int, **kwargs):\r\n        super().__init__(**kwargs)\r\n        self.param = param\r\n\r\n    def execute(self, context):\r\n        self.defer(\r\n            trigger=TestTrigger(),\r\n            method_name=\"execute_complete\",\r\n        )\r\n\r\n    def execute_complete(self):\r\n        self.log.info(\"Done!\")\r\n\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=\"async_db\",\r\n    schedule_interval=None,\r\n    start_date=datetime(2023, 12, 31),\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n) as dag:\r\n    TestOperator.partial(task_id=\"test_task\").expand(param=list(range(1000)))\r\n```\r\nI triggered a manual Dag Run, which created 1000 mapped tasks and deferred them.\r\n\r\nI had the expected result in the log (login root) without any blocking in the event loop of the Triggerer, with reasonable resource consumption.\r\n\r\nThen I tested by replacing the trigger run method with:\r\n```python\r\n    async def run(self):\r\n        import asyncio\r\n\r\n        from airflow.models.connection import Connection\r\n\r\n        for _ in range(1000):\r\n            conn = Connection.get_connection_from_secrets(\"airflow_db\")\r\n            self.log.info(conn.login)\r\n            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)\r\n        yield {}\r\n```\r\nI got the result in the task log, but the Triggerer log was full of:\r\n```\r\n[2023-12-31T01:42:36.934+0000] {triggerer_job_runner.py:598} INFO - trigger async_db/manual__2023-12-31T01:42:07.645143+00:00/test_task/235/1 (ID 471) starting\r\n[2023-12-31T01:42:37.091+0000] {triggerer_job_runner.py:598} INFO - trigger async_db/manual__2023-12-31T01:42:07.645143+00:00/test_task/236/1 (ID 472) starting\r\n[2023-12-31T01:42:37.159+0000] {triggerer_job_runner.py:576} INFO - Triggerer's async thread was blocked for 0.57 seconds, likely by a badly-written trigger.

recent changes, adding removed and suspended state for breeze caused significant slow-down of autocompletion retrieval - as it turned out, because we loaded and parsed all provider yaml files during auto-completion - in order to determine list of providers available for some commands.\r\n\r\nWe already planned to replace the several states (suspended, not-ready, removed) with a single state field - by doing it and addding the field to pre-commit generated \"provider_dependencies.json\" we could switch to parsing the single provider_dependencies.json file and retrieve provider list from there following the state stored in that json file.\r\n\r\nThis also simplifies state management following the recently added state diagram by following the same state lifecycle:\r\n\r\n\"not-ready\" -> \"ready\" -> \"suspended\" -> \"removed\"\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

recent changes, adding removed and suspended state for breeze caused significant slow-down of autocompletion retrieval - as it turned out, because we loaded and parsed all provider yaml files during auto-completion - in order to determine list of providers available for some commands.\r\n\r\nWe already planned to replace the several states (suspended, not-ready, removed) with a single state field - by doing it and addding the field to pre-commit generated \"provider_dependencies.json\" we could switch to parsing the single provider_dependencies.json file and retrieve provider list from there following the state stored in that json file.\r\n\r\nThis also simplifies state management following the recently added state diagram by following the same state lifecycle:\r\n\r\n\"not-ready\" -> \"ready\" -> \"suspended\" -> \"removed\"\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

our users are not aware that they are responsible for setting up and monitoring the database they chose as the metaa-data backend.\r\n\r\nWhile details of the tables and database structure of the metadata DB used by Airflow is internal detail, the monitoring, tracking the usage, fine-tuning and optimisation of the database configuration and detecting some cases where database becomes a bottle neck is generally a task that Deployment Manager should be aware of and it should be approached in a generic way - specific to the database chosen by the Deployment Manager and it also depends a lot on the choice of managed database if managed database is chosen by the Deployment Manager.\r\n\r\nThis chapter makes it explicit and gives enough leads to the Deployment Manager to be able to follow after they chose the database, it also explain the specific parameters tha the Deployment Manager should pay attention to when setting up such monitoring.\r\n\r\nWe also add an explanation of how Deployment Manager can setup client-side logging of SQL queries generated by Airflow in case database access is suspected for performance issues with Airflow, as a poor-man's version of complete, server-side monitoring and explains caveats of such client side configuraiton.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

our contributors check out Airflow repository on filesystems that are not POSIX compliant and do not have support for executable bits (for example when you check-out the repository in Windows and attempt to map it to a Linux VM). Breeze and building CI images will not work in this case, but the error that you see might be misleading.\r\n\r\nThis PR performs additional environment check and informs you that you should not do it, if executable bits are missing from entrypoints.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

applying result of the discussion about \"resolving conversation\" I have found that it would be good - while enabling it to test it to describe a bit better and explain some of the things we learned and \"practice\" for our PRs, so that we can easily refer to it when contributors ask us what to expect when they opened a PR.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces the following:\r\n\r\n* explains the contributors what they can expect during PR review\r\n* explains what expectations we have for such PRs and what is the role of author in fulfilling the expectations and following up\r\n* explain how to treat conversations and how using conversations and expecting them to be resolved is a sign of trust\r\n* explains that we experimentally enable the \"resolve conversation\" requirement and why we are doing it, and what we expect to get from it\r\n* adds a few PR guidelines that we often discuss and explain to the contributors but we did not have them written down.\r\n* cleans up protected_branches configuration in the .asf.yaml and enables \"resolve conversation\" requirement for `main` branch\r\n* it also adds \"linear history\" requirement for all our `main` and `stable` brances - that was implicitly protected also by our merge policies, but enabling it explicitly is better protection for case where someone would enable \"merge\" approach temporarily for other branches (maybe).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR improves/simplifies the process of issue generation when provider package rc candidates are prepared for voting.\r\n\r\nIt improves the commmand to generate the issue and makes it simpler (less copy&paste) to create such issue, the issue also does not use the \"Meta\" template and gets the right labels assigned automatically.\r\n\r\nRecent changes that automatically derive the suffix from PyPI packages prepared, removed the need of passing `--suffix` as parameter. In all cases the right rc* suffix will be automatically added during issue generation based on the version of package being prepared. The process has been updated and command simplified by removing the `--suffix` flag.\r\n\r\nWhen the issue is prepared, we display the issue in terminal and asked the release manager to create the issue by copy&pasting the issue content and title to a new issue, but that required a few copy&pastes and opening new Issue via \"Meta\" task type. This PR simplifies it a bit by not only displaying the content but also generating a URL that can be either copy&pasted to browser URL field or just Cmd+clicked if your terminal allows that. Issue created this way does not have the \"Body\" field header and has the labels properly assigned including a dedicated \"testing status\" label that is used to gether stats for past \"status\" issues.\r\n\r\nThe advice for release manager has been improved (the comment generated had some missing end of sentence and it should be now clearer on how to iterate during issue generation if you want to remove some PRs from the generated issue content.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

methods=[\\\"GET\\\"])\n@auth.has_access_dag(\\\"PUT\\\", DagAccessEntity.TASK_INSTANCE)\n@action_logging\ndef confirm(self):\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Show confirmation page for marking tasks as success or failed.\\\"\\\"\\\"\n    args = request.args\n\n    ...\n\n    dag_id = args.get(\\\"dag_id\\\")\n\n    ...\n\n    dag = get_airflow_app().dag_bag.get_dag(dag_id)\n    if not dag:\n        msg = f\\\"DAG {dag_id} not found\\\"\n        return redirect_or_json(origin, msg, status=\\\"error\\\", status_code=404)\n```\n\nHere request handler method `confirm` reads the value of request parameter `dag_id`. If no associated `dag` object is found then it cobstructs a string `msg` with it and passes it to `redirect_or_json` method which sends back a response containing that `msg`. Since flask automatically url decodes request parameters `dag_id` can be assigned javascript code which will be sent back as part of the response. \n\nBut the response content-type is application/json, so injected payload remains as a JSON data value in a JSON name/value pair and doesn't execute. So this isn't exactly an XSS vulnerability. Still if a client-side script receives this JSON value and uses some unsafe DOM update method e.g. `setInnerHTML`, `document.write` etc. then this could be a case of client-side XSS vulnerability.\n\n### Exploitable Scenario\n\nConsider the following simple client side page.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\\\"en\\\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\\\"UTF-8\\\">\n    <meta name=\\\"viewport\\\" content=\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\\">\n    <title>Fetch and Display Data</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\\\"detail\\\"></div>\n\n<script>\n    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n        var pos=document.URL.indexOf(\\\"dag_id=\\\")+7;\n\n        var dagId = decodeURIComponent(document.URL.substring(pos));\n\n        fetch(`https://example.airflow.com/confirm?dag_id=${dagId}`)\n            .then(response => response.text())\n            .then(data => {\n                document.getElementById(\\\"detail\\\").innerHTML = data;\n\n            })\n            .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));\n    });\n</script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nLet's assume the page invoked with an URL such as\n```\nhttp://www.some.site/confirm_page.html?dag_id=123\n```\nThe script wihtin the page reads the `dag_id` parameter value from the url and sends a GET request to the above server with that value. The server then sends a Not Found response message if no associated dag object is found with the `dag_id` value included. \n\nNow an XSS attack can be carried out by sending an URL like below to a victim.\n```\nhttp://www.some.site/confirm_page.html?dag_id=%3Cimg%20src%3D%27x%27%20onerror%3D%27alert%281%29%27%3E\n```\n\nThe payload here is a URL-encoded form of the following:\n\n```\n<img src='x' onerror='alert(1)'>\n```\n\nSince the client-side code here uses an unsafe DOM update method `(element).innerHTML` the injected payload will execute in the victim's browser.\n\n### Suggested Fix\n\nOne possible fix is sanitizing user provided data `dag_id` by defining a regex pattern that represents all inappropriate characters like the following:\n\n```python\npattern = re.compile(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9_\\-]')\n```\nThen any character that matches the above pattern can be replaced with an empty string using following statement:\n\n```python\ndag_id = re.sub(pattern, '', dag_id)\n```\nNow if an attacker supplies javascript code as value for `dag_id` e.g. `<script>alert(1)</script>`, it will just become `scriptalert1script`.\n\n### CLA Requirements:\nThis section is only relevant if your project requires contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for external contributions.\n\nAll contributed commits are already automatically signed off.\n\nThe meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin (see [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/) for more information).\n- [Git Commit SignOff documentation](https://developercertificate.org/)\n\n### Sponsorship and Support:\nThis work is done by the security researchers from OpenRefactory and is supported by the [Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)](https://openssf.org/): [Project Alpha-Omega](https://alpha-omega.dev/). Alpha-Omega is a project partnering with open source software project maintainers to systematically find new, as-yet-undiscovered vulnerabilities in open source code - and get them fixed - to improve global software supply chain security.\n\nThe bug is found by running the iCR tool by [OpenRefactory, Inc.](https://openrefactory.com/) and then manually triaging the

I haven't checked the performance yet, but if the approach is okay, I will check it if needed.

#36345\r\n\r\nWhen arrowing `group` >> `task`, the \"leaves\" of `group` are connected to `task`. When calculating leaves in the group, teardown tasks are ignored, and we recurse upstream to find non-teardowns.\r\n\r\nWhat was happening, and what this fixes, is you might recurse to a work task that already has another non-teardown downstream in the group.  In that case you should ignore the work task (because it already has a non-teardown descendent).\r\n\r\n###

change will automatically generate the **right** rcN package when prepareing the packages for PyPI. This allows to have pretty much continuous release process for voting over the provider packages.\r\n\r\nSimply when an rcN candidate is not released, it will be automatically included in the next wave of packages with rcN+1 version - unless during provider package generation the version will be bumped to MAJOR or MINOR due to new changes.\r\n\r\nThis allows for the workflow where in every new wave we always generate all provider packages ready for release.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

`create_or_replace_document_objects` as an operator that handles a very common scenario of ingesting objects derived from unique documents and we have to keep up with the changes in documents. \r\n\r\n### Example\r\nIf we have a document `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal` the entire document is converted to smaller chunks because LLM models have limitations on max data they can handle in a call.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the document is converted into two chunks\r\n\r\n##### Chunk 1:\r\nThe Taj Mahal  'Crown of the Palace' is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna Agra Uttar Pradesh India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. \r\n\r\n##### Chunk 2:\r\nThe tomb is the centerpiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Changes:\r\n\r\nFor LLM models to answer the question correctly they need to have only updated information and that's why there is a requirement to keep only the latest set of chunks in the Database. \r\n\r\nIf now for example we later came to know that the Taj Mahal was actually commissioned in 1593 there are changes introduced in the document and there was a change in chunking/tokenizing strategy. Now we have a different set of chunks. \r\n\r\n##### Chunk 1:\r\nThe Taj Mahal  'Crown of the Palace' is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna Agra Uttar Pradesh India.\r\n\r\n##### Chunk 2:\r\n It was commissioned in 1593 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. \r\n\r\n##### Chunk 3:\r\nThe tomb is the centerpiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.\r\n\r\nWith these new chunks, we have no way of knowing which exact chunk to replace because there can be multiple ways a document can be chunked/tokenized and it may result in splitting the document differently. So our best bet is to drop all the objects belonging to a document and re-create the document entirely. \r\n\r\n`WeaviateDocumentIngestOperator` handles these complexities operates at the document level and offers an `existing` param with possible values:\r\n \r\n1. `replace`: replace the existing objects with new objects.

PR adds possibility of marking the provider as \"not ready\" in the provider.yaml (by setting optional field as \"not-ready\" to `true\".\r\n\r\nSetting provider as \"not-ready\", removes it by default from all the release management commands - preparing documentation files preparing provider packages, publishing docs.\r\n\r\nYou can include such providers via `--include-not-ready-providers` flag (or setting INCLUDE_NOT_READY_PROVIDERS environment variable to true).\r\n\r\nThis flag is set to True in our CI, so that we can make sure the providers in-progress are also being tested and verified, but when release manager prepares packages, those providers are not prepared.\r\n\r\nThat will help in early stage of a lifecycle of a provider when we already want to iterate and test it continuously, but - for example the API of such provider is not yet stable or when we are in progress of moving functionality for such provider from core.\r\n\r\nThis PR also marks `fab` providers as \"not-ready\" as it is still early days and we want to exclude it for now from any kind of release process.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more

PR updates released process for providers to enable releasing providers in more regular batches. Sometimes when we exclude a provider from previous voting, we want to release RCN (2,3 etc.) candidate.\r\n\r\nHowever, especially when time between previous RC and the new one is long (for example because fixing took a long time) we might want to release the RCN release for that cancelled providers and RC1 for all the providers that have been changed in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThis cchange makes it possible (and easy):\r\n\r\n1) release RC1 for all providers (the RCN provider should be skipped,\r\n   because tag for this provider already exists.\r\n\r\n2) release the RCN providers with `--version-suffix-for-pypi rcN`.\r\n\r\nThe release process and tools were updated to account for that - where rc candidate number is retrieved from packages prepared in `dist`.\r\n\r\nFixed a few small missing things in the process.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
