fixes two issues which together caused the soak to crash/some test to fail occasionally.\r\n\r\nWhat happened was:\r\nIn the main `StreamThread` loop we initialized a new task in `TaskManager#checkForCompletedRestoration` which includes registering, but not initializing, its changelogs. We then complete the loop and call poll, which resulted in a rebalance that revoked the newly-initialized task. In `TaskManager#handleAssignment` we then closed the task cleanly and go to remove the changelogs from the `StoreChangelogReader` only to get an `IllegalStateException` because the changelog partitions were not in the restore consumer's assignment (due to being uninitialized).\r\n\r\nThis by itself should^ be a recoverable error, as we catch exceptions here and retry closing the task as unclean. Of course the task actually was successfully closed (clean) so we now get an unexpected exception `Illegal state CLOSED while closing active task`\r\n\r\nThe fix(es) I'd propose are:\r\n1) ~~Keep the restore consumer's assignment in sync with the registered changelogs, ie the set `ChangelogReader#changelogs` but pause them until they are initialized~~ edit: since the consumer does still perform some actions (gg fetches) on paused partitions, we should avoid adding uninitialized changelogs to the restore consumer's assignment. Instead, we should just skip them when removing.\r\n2) Move the `StoreChangelogReader#remove` call to _before_ the `task.closeClean` so that the task is only marked as closed if everything was successful. We should do so regardless, as we should (attempt to) remove the changelogs even if the clean close failed and we must do unclean.","created_at":"2020-02-20T02:57:14Z","updated_at":"2020-06-26T22:37:58Z","closed_at":"2020-02-20T21:24:39Z","merged_at":"2020-02-20T21:24:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"0d16c26e3c0affadfada1ce91faa617dc065dbcd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8140/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8140/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8140/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/3164fce49de499e640dad11ed3d56ba47ad14bb7","head":{"label":"ableegoldman:HOTFIX-dont-re-close-closed-task","ref":"HOTFIX-dont-re-close-closed-task","sha":"3164fce49de499e640dad11ed3d56ba47ad14bb7","user":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166325386,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYzMjUzODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ableegoldman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman/kafka","description":"Mirror

SSL-related configs are currently defined only in the `DistributedConfig` class, even though they are applicable for standalone mode as well (since standalone mode also supports the Connect REST API). Because of how these configs are parsed by the framework, it's currently impossible to configure Connect in standalone mode to use SSL for the REST API with a password-protected keystore, key, or truststore, and even if no password protection is required, SSL configs will not be picked up correctly by the worker if any of the worker configs start with the `listeners.https.` prefix.\r\n\r\nThese changes define the relevant SSL-related configs in the parent `WorkerConfig` class, which should fix how they are picked up in standalone mode.\r\n\r\nA new unit test is added to verify that the `StandaloneConfig` picks up these configs correctly.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

the stack trace on the Jira, I think the issue might be related to the shared mock object we use.\r\n\r\nThe test testup is a little bit upside down to allow the usage of reflection. The test verifies that a method is called, by _not_ registering an expected call, and catching the corresponding exception from `verify()` (because we use reflections, we cannot easily register an expected call and let `verify()` throw if the call was not made).\r\n\r\nThus, the expected message from `verify()` is something like:\r\n```\r\nUnexpected method call DBOptions.setEnableThreadTracking(true):\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the test fails the stack trace says:\r\n```\r\nUnexpected method call DBOptions.setEnableThreadTracking(true):\\n    DBOptions.close(): expected: 1, actual: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt indicates that an expected call was registered, however, the test actually never does this. Thus, I suspect that the mocked object is not isolated and as the tests are executed in parallel some race-condition applies (eg, one thread calls a method in the actual test to eventually trigger the exception in verify, while the other thread is just calling `replay()` accidentally register the call of the other thread as expected method call). \r\n\r\nThis fix tries to address the issue, by moving the mocked objects as local variables into the test methods.\r\n\r\nCall for review @vvcephei @bbejeck @cadonna

PR is to fix the retry logic for `getListOffsetsCalls`. Previously, if there were partitions with errors, it would only pass in the current call object to retry after a metadata refresh. However this is incorrect as if there's a leader change, the call object never gets updated with the correct leader node to query. This PR fixes this by making another call to `getListOffsetsCalls` with only the error topic partitions as the next calls to be made after the metadata refresh. In addition there is an additional test to test the scenario where a leader change occurs.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n-

the statuses for tasks are removed from the status store when their _connector_ is deleted, their statuses are not removed when only the task is deleted, which happens in the case that the number of tasks for a connector is reduced.\r\n\r\nThese changes add logic for deleting the statuses for those tasks from the status store whenever a rebalance has completed and the leader of a distributed cluster has detected that there are recently-deleted tasks. Standalone is also updated to accomplish this.\r\n\r\nUnit tests for the `DistributedHerder` and `StandaloneHerder` classes are updated, and an integration test has been added.","created_at":"2020-02-14T20:58:16Z","updated_at":"2020-05-25T16:10:04Z","closed_at":"2020-05-25T16:10:04Z","merged_at":"2020-05-25T16:10:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"de6468ae5915298279e229dc64721e01e7d14fab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8118/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8118/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8118/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/4bd4bc32249c50608039b95ffe8ab338a9c2126b","head":{"label":"C0urante:kafka-9472","ref":"kafka-9472","sha":"4bd4bc32249c50608039b95ffe8ab338a9c2126b","user":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83460713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQ2MDcxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"C0urante/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante/kafka","description":"Mirror

PR fixes two bugs related to stream refactoring:\r\n\r\n1. The subscribed topics are not updated correctly when topic gets removed from broker. \r\n2. The `remainingPartitions` computation doesn't account the case when one task has a pattern subscription of multiple topics. Then the input partition change will not be assumed as `containsAll`\r\n\r\nThe bugs are exposed from integration test `testRegexMatchesTopicsAWhenDeleted` and could be used to verify the fix works.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

tracked the recent increase in the flakiness of one of the offset reset tests (KAFKA-9538) back to https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/7941. After investigation, I found that following this patch, the consumer was sending an additional metadata request prior to performing the group assignment. This slight timing difference was enough to trigger the test failures. The problem turned out to be due to a bug in `SubscriptionState.groupSubscribe`, which no longer counted the local subscription when determining if there were new topics to fetch metadata for. Hence the extra metadata update.\r\n\r\nWithout the fix, I saw 30-50% test failures locally. With it, I could no longer reproduce the failure. However, #6561 is probably still needed to improve the resilience of this test.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

`validateOffsetsAsync`, we group the requests by leader node for efficiency. The list of topic-partitions are grouped from `partitionsToValidate` (all partitions) to `node` => `fetchPostitions` (partitions by node). However, when actually sending the request with `OffsetsForLeaderEpochClient`, we use `partitionsToValidate`, which is the list of all topic-partitions passed into `validateOffsetsAsync`. This results in extra partitions being included in the request sent to brokers that are potentially not the leader for those partitions.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by using `fetchPositions`, which is the proper list of partitions that we should send in the request. Additionally, a small typo of API name in `OffsetsForLeaderEpochClient` is corrected (it originally referenced `LisfOffsets` as the API name).\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nTested with the following configuration:\r\n\r\ntopic-partitions:\r\n```\r\n❯ kafkacat -b localhost:8080 -L\r\nMetadata for all topics (from broker -1: localhost:8080/bootstrap):\r\n 3 brokers:\r\n  broker 1 at localhost:9092 (controller)\r\n  broker 2 at localhost:9093\r\n  broker 3 at localhost:9094\r\n 2 topics:\r\n  topic \"broker-a.only\" with 1 partitions:\r\n    partition 0, leader 1, replicas: 1, isrs: 1\r\n  topic \"broker-b.only\" with 5 partitions:\r\n    partition 0, leader 2, replicas: 2, isrs: 2\r\n    partition 1, leader 2, replicas: 2, isrs: 2\r\n    partition 2, leader 2, replicas: 2, isrs: 2\r\n    partition 3, leader 2, replicas: 2, isrs: 2\r\n    partition 4, leader 2, replicas: 2, isrs: 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nbefore the change: `broker-a.only-1` was sent to broker 2, which is not the leader for this partition.\r\n\r\nafter the change: `broker-a.only-1` was not sent to broker 2.\r\n\r\nClient tests are run with `./gradlew :clients:test`. Ideas for additional tests are welcome!\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n-

ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9374)\r\n\r\nThese changes allow herders to continue to function even when a connector they are running hangs in its start, stop, initialize, validate, and/or config methods.\r\n\r\nThe main idea is to make these connector interactions asynchronous and accept a callback that can be invoked upon the completion (successful or otherwise) of these interactions. The distributed herder handles any follow-up logic by adding a new herder request to its queue in that callback, which helps preserve some synchronization and ordering guarantees provided by the current tick model.\r\n\r\nIf any connector refuses to shut down within a graceful timeout period, the framework will abandon it and potentially start a new connector in its place (in cases such as connector restart or reconfiguration).\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests for the distributed herder and worker have been modified to reflect these changes, and a new integration test named `BlockingConnectorTest` has been added to ensure that they work in practice.","created_at":"2020-02-08T02:36:53Z","updated_at":"2020-10-09T18:27:20Z","closed_at":"2020-06-11T08:29:24Z","merged_at":"2020-06-11T08:29:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"7f4fc76e968a6b2cf4a73364c93bfdea03f81af3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8069/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8069/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8069/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/bfb1bc04832b342e614e891d6da5af1f8ebe30a5","head":{"label":"C0urante:kafka-9374","ref":"kafka-9374","sha":"bfb1bc04832b342e614e891d6da5af1f8ebe30a5","user":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83460713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQ2MDcxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"C0urante/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante/kafka","description":"Mirror

contain the specified field. It's a common situation for connectors like Debezium which produce different \"kinds\" of records/topics; in our case e.g. actual change event topics and meta-topics such as TX data or schema history. One might want to apply the `ExtractField` SMT to the CDC records but not to those others; as that's currently not possible, a strategy is needed for more gracefully handling records without the specified field. Also see [KAFKA-7052](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7052) for some backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to add a new option `behavior.on.non.existent.field` to the SMT which makes the behavior configurable. Its supported values are:\r\n\r\n* fail: raise an exception (default for records with schema)\r\n* return-null: return null (default for records without schema)\r\n* pass-on: pass on the unmodified original record\r\n\r\nThe defaults are so to keep backwards compatibility with the current behavior. The \"pass-on\" value will address the original use case reported in KAFKA-7052.\r\n\r\nI did a quick implementation of that proposal to foster feedback. Happy to adjust and expand as needed, e.g. to adjust with existing naming patterns for the option and/or its values as well as docs (not sure where that'd go). Thanks!\r\n\r\nCC @rmoff,

Removed task field from TaskMigrated; the only caller that encodes a task id from StreamTask actually do not throw so we only log it. To handle it on StreamThread we just always enforce rebalance (and we would call onPartitionsLost to remove all tasks as dirty).\r\n\r\n2. Added TaskCorruptedException with a set of task-ids. The first scenario of this is the restoreConsumer.poll which throws InvalidOffset indicating that the logs are truncated / compacted. To handle it on StreamThread we first close the corresponding tasks as dirty (if EOS is enabled we would also wipe out the state stores), and then revive them into the CREATED state.\r\n\r\n3. Also fixed a bug while investigating KAFKA-9572: when suspending / closing a restoring task we should not commit the new offsets but only updating the checkpoint file.\r\n\r\n4. Re-enabled the unit test.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9509\r\n\r\nAs the JIRA indicates, `org.apache.kafka.connect.mirror.MirrorConnectorsIntegrationTest.testReplication` has shown to be an increasingly flaky test recently. This PR aims to make this test more deterministic. Specifically, the flakiness was due to a timing issue between the tasks not starting up in time for the test to start running. This PR remediates that by introducing a status check after every connector is started up. These status checks include that the connector is found on the connect cluster as well as there are tasks created and up and running for that connector. These checks are introduced before the test starts running so that there is a confidence that the connectors and tasks are started up correctly before the test runs.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade
