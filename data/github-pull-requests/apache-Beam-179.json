The node representing the source of the Side input was previously being added as a root transform, which is OK as far as the model is concerned, but for ordering dependent runners (like Dataflow is currently), this can cause issues, since it requires nodes be specified before they're depended on (topological ordering). \r\n\r\nThis change ensures that new side input nodes are added as siblings to their consumer's scope, rather than as unique root transforms, which fits things into the pipeline hypergraph naturally.\r\n\r\nAdded additional tests to the translation from the Go SDK's internal representation, to the PPP, and modified one of the integration tests to trigger this behavior.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

appears that `pubsub.SubscriberClient()` creates a grpc channel which must be closed explicitly after we are done pulling messages from that channel. This may have been due to change that was introduced in [grpc v1.12.0](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/releases/tag/v1.12.0) (\"*a new grpc.Channel.close method is introduced and correct use of gRPC Python now requires that channels be closed after use.*\"). If the underling grcp channel is not closed and many `pubsub.SubscriberClient` instances are created, the system may run out of available file handles, resulting in \"too many open files\" errors.\r\n\r\nA similar issue has been reported here: googleapis/google-cloud-python#5523, and it appears that the solution is to explicitly close the grpc transport channel after the subscription is no longer needed.\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is a fix for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-7414\r\nBasically, when receiving a RabbitMqMessage, I copy all its delivery fields into a new delivery object, which allows me to replace LongString by String.\r\nThe try/catch loop is there for cases where LongString objects are too long to be transformed into String\r\n\r\nCode can be reviewed by @jbonofre or @aromanenko-dev which are both aware of the issue (but i guesse @jbonofre would be a better reviewer)\r\n\r\nNotice that i'm trying to communicate with RabbitMq team in parallel to have issue fixed in a more elegant way on their side\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds a performance test for BigQuery IO read. It sets up BQ table with input data if needed, reads data from that table and does a final assertion. The test takes the same set of command line parameters as LoadTest. This allows to run tests with any data size needed.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

HdfsIntegrationTest fails constantly after we installing the gcloud docker-credential-gcr on build workers. This is because of the docker-credential-gcr overwrites the ~/.docker/config.json that docker-compose uses the wrong credentials for build. To solve this problem, remove the config.json before running the docker-compose commands.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is just three small changes:\r\n\r\n1. Remove default top-level error messages. If a top-level msg wasn't set then just don't display any. Originally top-level messages were always displayed because it was assumed the error would be confusing if it started with context instead of an error message. But in practice that's actually less confusing.\r\n\r\nOld behavior:\r\n```\r\nerror message\r\nFull Error:\r\n    context:\r\n    more context:\r\nerror message\r\n```\r\n\r\nNew behavior:\r\n```\r\n    context:\r\n    more context:\r\nerror message\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Align the \"Caused by:\" msg on wrapped errors with the context\r\n   messages, to improve readability.\r\n\r\nOld behavior:\r\n```\r\nerror number 4\r\nCaused by:\r\n    some context:\r\nerror number 3\r\nCaused by:\r\nerror number 2\r\nCaused by:\r\nerror number 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nNew behavior:\r\n```\r\nerror number 4\r\n    caused by:\r\n    some context:\r\nerror number 3\r\n    caused by:\r\nerror number 2\r\n    caused by:\r\nerror number 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Improvement to an error message that I missed.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

support for Beam schemas in BigQuery reads.\r\n\r\nDirect reads are not supported yet. Support for different date/time types and RECORD types are pending as well.\r\n\r\nThe largest change is the refactoring of `BigQueryTableSource` and `BigQueryQuerySource` classes. As the schema inference has to happen at pipeline construction time, the reusable code for accessing the table/query results have been extracted out to \"source definition\" classes named `BigQueryTableSourceDef` and `BigQueryQuerySourceDef`. \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
