will soon replace many examples in the Beam doc with runnable embedded Playground instances. This PR adds the means for this:\r\n\r\n1. **`playground` and `playground_snippet` Hugo shortcodes** that can be used like this:\r\n```hugo\r\n{{< playground height=\"700px\" >}}\r\n{{< playground_snippet language=\"java\" example=\"SDK_JAVA/PRECOMPILED_OBJECT_TYPE_KATA/AggregationCount\" >}}\r\n{{< playground_snippet language=\"py\" example=\"SDK_PYTHON/PRECOMPILED_OBJECT_TYPE_KATA/AggregationCount\" >}}\r\n{{< playground_snippet language=\"go\" example=\"SDK_GO/PRECOMPILED_OBJECT_TYPE_EXAMPLE/MinimalWordCount\" >}}\r\n{{< playground_snippet language=\"scio\" example=\"SDK_SCIO/PRECOMPILED_OBJECT_TYPE_EXAMPLE/MinimalWordCount\" >}}\r\n{{< /playground >}}\r\n```\r\nTo save resources, each instance of the embedded playground serves all languages for a given example.\r\n\r\n2. **The language switch changed to send messages to Playground iframes** to switch language there. The same switch is now used for both passive HTML examples and runnable Playground instances.\r\n\r\n3. **The language switch was refactored** for easier implementation of this change due to many old problems there.\r\n\r\nFor the new shortcodes to work, the following Playground changes need to be deployed:\r\n\r\n- To load examples: #22430, closed by merging but not deployed as of writing.\r\n- To switch languages when the tabs are switched: #22362.\r\n\r\nUntil then, the new shortcodes can only be tested with local Playground instance by changing the URL in `playground.html` to `localhost:xxxx`.\r\n\r\nThis PR is safe to merge and deploy in any order with the above, if the new shortcodes are not used in the docs until all Playground changes are deployed.\r\n\r\nResolves #22354\r\nResolves #22363\r\nResolves #22361\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

testing utilities (and some prod utilities as well) default to converting individual data values into strings when converting data to JSON-encoded TableRow objects. This makes some testing difficult, as data types can't be recovered properly.\r\n\r\nThis change ensures that JSON conversion preserves the data type when possible in JSON (boolean, int32, float, double) so that testing and other consumers of TableRow data can expect correct types.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/21671\r\n\r\nThe issue was caused by a deliberate [change in behavior](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93060#issuecomment-1133791913) in Python 3.10 due to [bpo-27129](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27129). The offsets were originally byte (8 bits) offsets in Python 3.9, but instruction (16 bits) offsets in Python 3.10. The opcode numbers were halved, so to compensate, I had to double them again when reading it.\r\n\r\nA few other tests were failing too. I had to add an opcode due to [bpo-43683](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=43683) in which a [new bytecode GEN_START](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/87849) was added. \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#22900 \r\n\r\nThis adds one time use stream decoders for use whenever we know reiterations won't occur (see issue).\r\n\r\nAdds tests, and improves test coverage with a datasource tests for the various iterator handlers (on demand and fixed), unit tests for the on demand decode streams, a new test for pardo short reads, and a primitives test for GBK short reads.\r\n\r\nFixes previous benign issue where value iteration streams were not being closed after the processing DoFn finished, and test for same. Since we always fully read the byte stream for a value, we never ran into a short read problem before. Streaming decode short reads on the data side would cause problems that don't occur with short reads for Side Inputs.\r\n\r\nThere's a followup task for optimizing short reads when the coder being used is length prefixed, filed in #22901. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
