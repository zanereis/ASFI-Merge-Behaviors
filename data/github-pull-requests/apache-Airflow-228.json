to #9609\r\n\r\nA major advantage of this new sensor is idempotence for the `target_time`.\r\n\r\nIt handles some cases for which `TimeSensor` and `TimeDeltaSensor` are not suited. \r\n\r\n**Example 1)** If a task needs to wait for 11am on each `execution_date`. Using `TimeSensor` or `TimeDeltaSensor`, all backfill tasks started at 1am have to wait for 10 hours. This is unnecessary, e.g. a backfill task with `{{ ds }} = '1970-01-01'` does not need to wait because `1970-01-01T11:00:00` has already passed.\r\n\r\n**Example 2)** If a DAG is scheduled to run at 23:00 daily, but one of the tasks is required to run at 01:00 next day, using `TimeSensor` will return `True` immediately because 23:00 > 01:00. Instead, we can use `DateTimeSensor`:\r\n```python\r\n        DateTimeSensor(\r\n            task_id='wait_for_0100',\r\n            target_time='{{ next_execution_date.tomorrow().replace(hour=1) }}',\r\n            dag=dag\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn another topic - I think `TimeSensor`, `TimeDeltaSensor`, and this `DateTimeSensor` should probably be put in the same file `sensors/time.py`. What does everyone think? But that will be a breaking change. Will have to do it in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Unit tests coverage
