PR is part of the stage M3c of the meta schedule project (#8473).\r\n\r\nThe architecture is re-designed by Junru and Xiyou. `ScheduleRule` class is used for modification of blocks in a schedule. `Mutator` is designed to mutate the trace to explore the design space. `Postproc` class is the rule to apply a post processing to a schedule. These classes are defined to enhance design space generation, search strategy mutation and schedule post processing. Docs and examples are added in the code, while unit tests are also added. Python-side customizable class are also added for easy modification.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Junru Shao <<junrushao1994@gmail.com>>\r\nCo-authored-by: Bohan Hou

`types-psutil` package adds type hints for `mypy` (will update later to remove the ignore on this once the docker image is rebuilt) and `# type: ignore` stops `mypy` from trying to figure out types of `_ffi_api` resources.\r\n\r\nThere's also a few places where variable type definitions are repeated even though they're only required once.\r\n\r\nFinally, I've ensured `task_mypy.sh` fails the build

refactors were initially part of work to implement https://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/pull/39, but ended up being independent of those changes, and do not change existing behavior.\r\n\r\n- Added `ScheduleToPrimFunc`, extracting out common behavior in `ScheduleToModule` and `auto_scheduler`'s feature extraction.\r\n\r\n- Added `tvm.driver.build_module.schedule_to_module`, to avoid needing the 4-line boilerplate needed to do so in several unit tests.  This also makes deviations from the usual path (e.g. `debug_keep_trivial_loop`) more

Motivation\r\nHaving an ability to overwrite the mapping from TFLite Operators to TVM Relay Operators via downstream python scripts is desirable to:\r\n- Add support for unsupported builtin or even custom operators by adding a hand-written convert function\r\n- Enable a possibility to overwrite existing convert functions for supported operators by alternative implementations (useful for currently unsupported edge cases)\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Add optional argument `op_converter` to `tvm.relay.frontend.from_tflite` function, defaulting to `relay.frontend.tflite.OperatorConverter`\r\n- Add `allow_custom_ops ` flag to `OperatorConverter`, which allows to manually add convert function for `CUSTOM` opertator types\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nI also came up with a test case added to

of changes:\r\n- Updates value of `TVM_CRT_MAX_STRLEN_FUNCTION_NAME` from `80` to `120`\r\n- Replaces all occurences of `[120]` with `[TVM_CRT_MAX_STRLEN_FUNCTION_NAME]` to maintain consistency and make the array lengths user-configurable.\r\n- Introduces `TVM_CRT_MAX_STRLEN_PARAM_NAME` used for parameter names only\r\n- Adds comments to `kMaxFuncNameLength` variabe in src/relay/backend/te_compiler_cache.cc making sure that the values are kept \"in sync\". (sort of)\r\n\r\nSee Issue #8953 for more context.

the issue I raised in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9048#issuecomment-927116431\r\n\r\nSo previously, `layout_transform` is always inserted before reduction ops if the input is in a packed layout:\r\n```\r\nfn (%x: Tensor[(1, 56, 56, 64), float32], %weight1: Tensor[(32, 64, 3, 3), float32]) -> Tensor[(1, 56, 56, 1), float32] {\r\n  %0 = layout_transform(%x, src_layout=\"NHWC\", dst_layout=\"NCHW16c\") /* ty=Tensor[(1, 4, 56, 56, 16), float32] */;\r\n  %1 = nn.conv2d(%0, %weight1, padding=[1, 1, 1, 1], channels=32, kernel_size=[3, 3], data_layout=\"NCHW16c\") /* ty=Tensor[(1, 2, 56, 56, 16), float32] */;\r\n  %2 = layout_transform(%1, src_layout=\"NCHW16c\", dst_layout=\"NCHW\")\r\n  relay.sum(%2, axis=[1], keepdims=True)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, `layout_transform` is pushed to happen after reduce ops:\r\n```\r\nfn (%x: Tensor[(1, 56, 56, 64), float32], %weight1: Tensor[(32, 64, 3, 3), float32]) -> Tensor[(1, 56, 56, 1), float32] {\r\n  %0 = layout_transform(%x, src_layout=\"NHWC\", dst_layout=\"NCHW16c\") /* ty=Tensor[(1, 4, 56, 56, 16), float32] */;\r\n  %1 = nn.conv2d(%0, %weight1, padding=[1, 1, 1, 1], channels=32, kernel_size=[3, 3], data_layout=\"NCHW16c\") /* ty=Tensor[(1, 2, 56, 56, 16), float32] */;\r\n  %2 = sum(%1, axis=[1, 4], keepdims=True) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 1, 56, 56, 1), float32] */;\r\n  layout_transform(%2, src_layout=\"NCHW1c\", dst_layout=\"NHWC\") /* ty=Tensor[(1, 56, 56, 1), float32] */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe the latter one is better because `layout_transform` can potentially be fused with other ops following reduce ops, while in the former case `layout_transform` always happen on a bigger input. For example, in the `efficientnet_v2` model, all `layout_transform` after `mean` ops are fused with other injective ops like this, which is much better than the previous situation where more than 80 naked `layout_transform` ops are inserted before every `mean` op.\r\n```\r\n  %696 = fn (%p0397: Tensor[(1, 80, 29, 29, 4), float32], %p1264: Tensor[(80, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4), float32], %p2220: Tensor[(1,

Motivation\r\nI ran into the issue that I need to use C++ features in a BYOC generated kernel which is tricky to achieve because those are typically exported as `.c` files.\r\n\r\nI am aware of the possibility to force `gcc`/`g++` to threat all input files as C++ but this solves the issue only partially and is not really intuitive. Renaming the file names e.g. changing the file extension manually after the export via MLF is if also a workaround which does not work out for me.\r\n\r\n### Solution(s):\r\nI came up with two rather simple solutions to solutions to solve the explained limitation in the ability to choose the correct file extension for kernel files written by a custom codegen and implemented the first one in this PR because it should add minimal complexity to the TVM codebase which might be desirable:\r\n\r\n1. Each `CSourceModuleNode` already has a `format` field which can be set in the constructor. Currently it can not be accessed by other classes but this can be easily solved by adding a getter and the respective python hooks for that property. This information can then be accessed by i.e. [`model_library_format.py`](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/python/tvm/micro/model_library_format.py) to determine the file extension for the exported kernel. It would also be possible to use this interface for other types of modules in the future.\r\n\r\n2. Introduce a new class `CppSourceModuleNode` which is essentially a copy of `CSourceModule` with the only difference being the the the `module_key` which may then be used to choose a file extension in the aforementioned python functions. This sounds like much redundant code to me and also has less flexibility compared to option one as we would have to stick with either a `.cc` or a `.cpp` file extension for every modules of that type.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Open questions/thoughts:\r\n\r\nI realized that the module format `cc` is currently already used by the `CSourceCrtMetadataModuleNode` declared in [`source_module.cc`](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/src/target/source/source_module.cc#L331):\r\n\r\n```\r\nauto n = make_object<CSourceCrtMetadataModuleNode>(func_names, \"cc\", target, metadata);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does not really make sense to me and especially makes some AoT and Model Library Format related pytests fail because the metadata module now being exported as `.cc` instead of `.c` as explaind the the previous paragraph. Let me know if I should add the fix these Makefiles to this PR and keep the module format for the `CSourceCrtMetadataModuleNode` defined as `cc` or if should work around this issue instead by changing the module format of that file to `c`?\r\nI did not yet come up with new test cases which exercise the introduced changes to the MLF export as this would very likely result in a need to add a new dummy BYOC module which uses the `cc` format instead. During development I just patched the example [`codegen_c`](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/74aa856941ff31859d305b8ce564de23fb39ae2f/src/relay/backend/contrib/codegen_c/codegen.cc#L274) to export C++ kernels instead which worked fine,\r\n\r\n\r\nI decided against an RFC for this discussion as only a couple of lines are added to the TVM codebase to realize this feature. Let me know if I should make this a (Pre-)RFC instead. Otherwise I would be happy for any feedback and answers to the remaining questions introduced in the last section.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCC @areusch @Mousius @giuseros

using dynamic inputs shape with `gather` op results in segfault at https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/7deebc646c7c013f1bb0a71f88df0b70af11ffd0/src/relay/op/tensor/transform.cc#L3264, which is embarrassing. It turned out that even though `gather` is such a common op, it didn't support dynamic shapes. This PR fixed that.

TVM operations implementation using Cortex-M DSP instructions\r\n\r\n### nn.conv2d\r\n- We added the implementation of gemm function with 16-bit input\r\n- shape[-1] multiple of 4 restriction is resolved\r\n- There is data preparing before 8-bit intrinsic, such preparation will consume too much time in case of small tensor, so we add a check and simple cycle to handle this specific situation\r\n- In terms of optimization - calculations moved from inside of the intrinsic to outside\r\n- One of the buffers was radically cut(wasn't in use), lead to reducing memory requirements mostly in a half\r\n\r\n### nn.max_pool2d\r\n- Implemented with __SSUB8 and __SEL intrinsics for four 8-bit input values, which is lead to notable acceleration\r\n- Feature: implementation ready for not 1word-aligned input data\r\n- Feature: ready for data sizes not a multiple of 4\r\n- memset is used to initialize the minimum values, to provide max speed\r\n\r\n### nn.avg_pool2d\r\n- Due to lack of sum of four 8-bit values intrinsic - implementation could be possible only for 16-bit data\r\n-  __SMLAD intrinsic used to process two 16-bit values\r\n- Feature: implementation ready for not 1word-aligned input data\r\n- Feature: ready for data sizes not a multiple of 4\r\n\r\n### nn.dense\r\nImplemented with same gemm method, described above\r\n\r\n### nn.conv1d\r\nSpecific case of gemm usage - with one of data dimensions equal to 1\r\n\r\n### nn.avg_pool1d\r\nImplemented for NCW layout with same intrinsic as for 2d version of operation\r\n\r\n### nn.max_pool1d\r\nImplemented with same intrinsic as for 2d version of operation\r\n\r\n\r\n# Benchmarking:\r\nTo enable intrinsic code generation you should specify _-mcpu=cortex-m7_ flag\r\nHW platform: STM32F746 Nucleo; GCC10, optimization flags: -O3\r\nIf you want to enable intrinsic you should specify -march parameter of the target:\r\n`target_str = f\"c -keys=arm_cpu -mcpu=cortex-m7 -march=armv7e-m -model=stm32f746xx

patchset adds a new micro context to TVMC under `tvmc micro` command, allowing `tvmc` to be used for compiling, build, flashing, and running models on microTVM target devices.\r\n\r\nThe following typical workflow is provided as an example:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ wget https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro/raw/main/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/micro_speech/micro_speech.tflite\r\n$ tvmc

commit implements a greedy memory planning algorithms \r\nusing the proposed USMP design.There are two greedy algorithms \r\nintroduced here which use the size and number of conflicts as the criteria.\r\n\r\n* Adds few test cases checks for fan-out and linear structures.\r\n* Added a test case for ResNet sub-structure\r\n* Added a test case for MobileNet sub-structure\r\n*  This includes a slight fix for buffer info\r\n    extraction where non-linear network buffers\r\n    owned by the main function should not show\r\n    sporadic

All configuration are able to setup connection and call single remote function. Check that reconnection works correctly.\r\n2. For configurations `#1` \r\na. Check upload, download files.\r\nb. Check that uploaded files are removed after session end. Cleanup workspace.\r\nc. Check load of module with one kernel. Load, set input, run, check resulting tensor.         \r\n3. Check graph executor via RPC. One module with CPU kernels.\r\n4. Check tuners. Start micro tuning session with several trials: AutoSchedule\r\n\r\nRunning these tests is included in the GitHub actions CI and can be found in the check:\r\n```\r\nWinMacBuild / Build (macOS-latest)\r\n```","created_at":"2021-10-06T17:07:53Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T16:36:42Z","closed_at":"2021-10-28T16:36:42Z","merged_at":"2021-10-28T16:36:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"f4dae23478f41ee899e58533bdb31efc5b1b709e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_

values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)\r\n```\r\nThis is because TE thinks there is only one distinct input tensor. A related, more fundamental problem is that `cache_read` on `A` and `B` at https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/41879b2552364f094492470a77a3ec0866b30eae/python/tvm/topi/cuda/batch_matmul.py#L97-L100 try to create a cache for the same tensor, so the second one `BB = s.cache_read(B, \"shared\", [C])` fails (because `B`, which is the same as `A`, is replaced by `AA` in the TE graph when `AA = s.cache_read(A, \"shared\", [C])` is finished). Fixing this problem at this level requires making non-trivial and ad-hoc change to `schedule_dataflow_rewrite.cc` (correctly recognize multiple, distinct uses of the same Tensor).\r\n\r\nInstead, I chose a more dumb workaround, which is simply to let the second arg be a copy of the first tensor when two input args are identical. This would force TE to recognize two input tensors. Thanks to `compute_inline()`, there is no overhead. \r\n\r\nI wonder if TensorIR has the same problem. \r\n\r\ncc @comaniac @junrushao1994 @vinx13 @altanh

I encountered a problem when trying translating Pytorch models into relay. `relay.nn.bias_add` has a default `axis=1`, which is inconsistent with [linear](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.linear.html#torch.nn.functional.linear) in PyTorch (when ndim>2), which always adds bias to the last dimension. So it is necessary to explicitly assign `axis=-1` here.\r\n\r\nThanks @spectrometerHBH for helping debug. cc @junrushao1994

https://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/blob/main/rfcs/0027-formalize-documentation-organization.md\r\nTracking Issue: #8987\r\n\r\nStage 1 of the documentation refactor reorganizes the docs structure,\r\nmoving files (without content changes) and adding new scaffolding to\r\ngenerate the proper document tree.\r\n\r\nIt does not address naming, style, content, links, or other existing\r\ncontent in documents that were moved. State 2 will address fixing these\r\nissues with existing content.\r\n\r\nMajor changes include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n* Dividing the existing tutorials into two sections:\r\n  * Tutorials\r\n  * How Tos\r\n* Moving all of the existing tutorials out of the `/tutorial`\r\n  directory and into the more general `/gallery` directory.\r\n* Breaking up how-tos into individual sections for more\r\n  flexibility and more consistent rendering.\r\n* Moving content into new classifications:\r\n  * `/docs/arch` for architecture guides\r\n  * `/docs/reference` for API guides and other reference material\r\n  * `/docs/topic` for topic specific guides such as microTVM and VTA\r\n  * Restructuring `/docs/dev`\r\n* Adding a table of contents to the doc index\r\n* Adding instructions on how to install using third-party tlcpack\r\n\r\nStage 2 of the documentation refactor fixes naming and links\r\nin the documentation to be consistent with the overall structure.\r\n\r\nMajor changes include:\r\n\r\n* an update to how to contribute to docs.\r\n* several updated index pages with title changes to match\r\n  the organization style and bring consistency to the sections\r\n* expanded descriptions of some page collections\r\n* fixed links\r\n\r\nStage 3 of the documentation refactor adjusts CI for the new structure.\r\nThe CI build script takes into account the new gallery format. It\r\nalso prevents deleting existing documents, and takes advantage of the\r\n`_staging` and `_build` directories to clean out previous

PR replace the `AllocateNode::extents` variable, which represented the logical N-d shape of the tensor, with a 1-d `AllocateNode::extent` variable representing the amount of memory to be allocated.  This is part of a larger push to support more flexible memory layouts across multiple device types, and to introduce a split between the physical layout in memory and the logical layout in a tensor or a compute definition.\r\n\r\nThe commits of this PR are divided up into discrete sections to hopefully make it easier to review.\r\n\r\n1. Change `AllocateNode::extents` (plural) to `AllocateNode::extent` (singular).  This first commit is the motivation for the PR, and the remaining commits are the additional changes needed to be compatible with this first change.\r\n\r\n2. C++ changes necessary to compile against the new `AllocateNode` definition.\r\n\r\n3. A functionality addition to `IRBuilder` to output `BufferRealize`/`BufferLoad`/`BufferStore` nodes, in addition to `Allocate`/`Load`/`Store`.  This minimizes the changes that will be needed in the unit tests, as they can continue using N-d indices and allocations with `BufferRealize`/`BufferLoad`/`BufferStore`, which are then flattened during the `StorageFlatten` pass.\r\n\r\n4. Update topi schedules to use 1-d extent.\r\n\r\n5. Update python unittests to use 1-d extent.\r\n\r\n6. Simplify() call added to workspace size calculation, needed for the workspace calculation unit tests.\r\n\r\n7. Updated UnrollLoop to count `BufferStore` in addition to `Store`.  This resolves a breakage in the tests for unroll loop, and allows UnrollLoop to be used either before or after `StorageFlatten`.\r\n\r\n8. Refactor of the tests for unroll loop.

is the initial implementation which wires in a test case for TIRToRuntime, in order to get this working I re-used `CodegenCHost` as it implements all of the `Op`s required from the lowered `PrimFunc`. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the `IRModule` is non-unified but in future work it should definitely do so, I wanted to implement the basics here to get the infra in place.\r\n\r\nThe example now shows how to register the target, and customize the pipeline with minimal additional work involved :smile_cat:

default, pytest will sort tests to maximize the re-use of fixtures.  However, this assumes that all fixtures have an equal cost to\r\ngenerate, and no caches outside of those managed by pytest.  A fixture for a `tvm.testing.parameter` is effectively free, while a fixture maintaining a cache of reference data `tvm.testing.utils._fixture_cache` be quite large.\r\n\r\nSince most of the TVM fixtures are specific to a python function, sort the test ordering by python function, so that `tvm.testing.utils._fixture_cache` can be cleared sooner rather than later.","created_at":"2021-10-04T16:25:43Z","updated_at":"2021-10-14T13:07:55Z","closed_at":"2021-10-14T04:26:18Z","merged_at":"2021-10-14T04:26:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"523eb12a1a9ce92777afbe90e0b87f47712cad6a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"h

This is a simple op that runs many binary search in parallel. The same op can be used for numpy `digitize` and PT `bucketize` op.\r\n\r\nNumpy `searchsorted` op only supports 1D `sorted_sequence`, but both PT and TF generalize it for N-D.
