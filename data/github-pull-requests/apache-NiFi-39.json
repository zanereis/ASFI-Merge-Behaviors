This value is a constant from a predefined set of string parameters. The API enforces casing so a unit value of \"bytes\" fails to make a successful API request, whereas \"Bytes\" succeeds.  This fix validates if a user is typing the correct Unit value parameter prior to starting the PutCloudWatchMetric processor.\r\n\r\nThe proposed fix includes a new Validator() to warn the user about the issues prior to starting the PutCloudWatchMetric processor and a set to determine the partitions for the Unit field in API requests to AWS.

LoadBalanceSession.isComplete() followed by LoadBalanceSession.isCanceled() but it's possible for the complete flag to change before the canceled flag (they are not updated atomically). So changed to use a single LoadBalanceSessionState enum that represents the state. Also made the private StandardProcessSession.commit(boolean) method synchronized. When a processor is terminated (as is the case in Offload), we roll back sessions and both the commit() and rollback() need to be synchronized. Only the public commit() method was synchronized, and now with commitAsync() happening, we had the ability to commit without any synchronization. This addresses that concern. Also fixed a typo in docs for MergeRecord.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\r\n  contributor license agreements.

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9773 Refactors the `nifi-system-tests` module to use JUnit 5. The upgrade involved refactoring of the JUnit 4 `TestWatcher` in `NiFiSystemIT` to a new `TroubleshootingTestWatcher` implementation applied using the JUnit 5 `ExtendsWith` annotation.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include enabling the GitHub `system-tests` workflow for push and pull request operations that include changes to the `nifi-system-tests` path.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

This also meets success criteria for [accessibility standards in WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H57). Resolves ticket NIFI-9816.\r\n\r\nTesting the changes in this PR requires manual inspection of the <html> elements on the affected pages, noting that the changes in the nifi-web-api package are verified by inspecting the contents of the Documentation view's iframe.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-23T19:15:20Z","updated_at":"2022-03-30T13:52:52Z","closed_at":"2022-03-30T13:52:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1e233ffedf3263f44a70827618cb6e649aa6313a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5893/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5893/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5893/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/dfd62844b2d9bb9042eaed39ca24d4eb7f236420","head":{"label":"jocovo:NIFI-9816","ref":"NIFI-9816","sha":"dfd62844b2d9bb9042eaed39ca24d4eb7f236420","user":{"login":"jocovo","id":101148342,"node_id":"U_kgDOBgdmtg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101148342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jocovo","html_url":"https://github.com/jocovo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jocovo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jocovo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jocovo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jocovo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jocovo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jocovo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jocovo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jocovo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jocovo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":467282093,"node_id":"R_kgDOG9oorQ","name":"nifi","full_name":"jocovo/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jocovo","id":101148342,"node_id":"U_kgDOBgdmtg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101148342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jocovo","html_url":"https://github.com/jocovo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jocovo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jocovo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jocovo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jocovo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jocovo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jocovo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jocovo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jocovo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jocovo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jocovo/nifi","description":"Apache

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9823 Removes the `VolatileContentRepository` implementation of the `ContentRepository` interface.\r\n\r\nAlthough the volatile implementation has existed since project inception, it is subject to a number of feature and performance issues. The implementation has been broken since at least NiFi version 1.13.0, such that a number of processors fail to read FlowFile content under certain conditions. Recent enhancements to the NiFi Stateless engine provide a better path forward in terms of memory-based operations. Removing the `VolatileContentRepository`, rather than marking it deprecated, avoids potential confusion and clarifies the fact that this implementation is not supported.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8124 Adds support for persistent cookies within the InvokeHTTP processor. Previously, cookies weren't being carried over during redirects. This addition adds a new property \"Enable Cookie Redirects\", which will create a persistent cookie jar file that will properly handle cookies during HTTP redirects. By default, this is set to false, which will produce the current behavior of the processor.\r\n\r\nSee https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-8124\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9820 Reduces the `Kudu Client Worker Count` default value in the `PutKudu` Processor. The current default value is based on the JVM runtime-reported available processors, multiplied by 2. This value was based on the internal default value from the Kudu Client library. The updated value removes the multiplication by 2, setting the default value to match the number of runtime-reported processors.\r\n\r\nThis approach improves the default memory-usage behavior of the `PutKudu` in flows with numerous instances of the Processor. The new default value also minimizes the impact from older versions of `PutKudu` that do not have the `Kudu Client Worker Count` property, and relied on the internal default value from the Kudu Client library.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-21T04:01:30Z","updated_at":"2022-03-21T17:51:52Z","closed_at":"2022-03-21T12:24:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9969f542b2290b2b47fce2649f117b1ae07d3815","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5883/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5883/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5883/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/d9420107925e1123ac30faad2c03afceb8035f1b","head":{"label":"MundaneImmortal:fix-flaky","ref":"fix-flaky","sha":"d9420107925e1123ac30faad2c03afceb8035f1b","user":{"login":"MundaneImmortal","id":68594013,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTk0MDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68594013?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MundaneImmortal","html_url":"https://github.com/MundaneImmortal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MundaneImmortal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MundaneImmortal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MundaneImmortal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MundaneImmortal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MundaneImmortal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MundaneImmortal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MundaneImmortal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MundaneImmortal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MundaneImmortal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:main","ref":"main","sha":"7823156606ca541ef9cae7192b092efd2cfe4e9a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27911088,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzkxMTA4OA==","name":"nifi","full_name":"apache/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi","description":"Apache

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9807 Adds a configurable `Refresh Window` property to the `StandardOauth2AccessTokenProvider` Controller Service and removes the hard-coded expiration margin from the `AccessToken.isExpired()` determination.\r\n\r\nThe change to `AccessToken` restores the behavior of `isExpired()` present in NiFi 1.12.0 to 1.15.3, implemented in NIFI-7299. The `isExpired()` method relies on the exact time specified in the `expiresIn` seconds property received from the OAuth2 Token Issuer Server. The new `Refresh Window` property defaults to `0 s`, following the same approach, but enabling configurable behavior based on whether the particular token issuer provides short-lived or long-lived tokens.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9662 Removes an unused reference to `javax.mail:mail:1.4.7` in the dependency management section of the `nifi-framework-bundle` Maven configuration.  The `nifi-framework-nar`, `nifi-server-nar`, and `nifi-headless-server-nar` do not include any copies for the `javax.mail:mail` library, and no classes under `nifi-framework-bundle` module reference `javax.mail`.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [X] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9281 Updates a number of tests and several dependencies to support building the project on Java 17. The majority of the changes involve adjustments to unit tests in order to avoid illegal reflective access, which throws an error by default on Java 17. \r\n\r\nDependency updates include upgrading the Maven WAR Plugin, the QuestDB driver for NiFi Framework status history, and the version of Groovy used in several Graph Processors. The GitHub actions workflow includes a new build target for Java 17 on Ubuntu Linux.\r\n\r\nAlthough these changes enable a build across the project, some extension components may require further changes for full runtime support. Additional changes for particular components can be addressed in subsequent pull requests.\r\n\r\nThe following list summarizes the changes:\r\n\r\n- Added Ubuntu Zulu JDK 17 GitHub build\r\n- Adjusted MiNiFi C2 FileSystemConfigurationCache test to avoid using environment variables\r\n- Adjusted MiNiFi StatusLogger and StatusLoggerTest to avoid overriding private logger\r\n- Adjusted failure reason attribute check in TestGetIgniteCache\r\n- Adjusted TestRangerAuthorizer and TestRangerNiFiAuthorizer to avoid checking nested exceptions\r\n- Adjusted encrypt-config TestUtil to avoid unnecessary comparison of different types\r\n- Disabled Javascript tests on Java 15 and higher due to removal of Nashorn from the JRE\r\n- Disabled several Hive 3 tests on Java 17 for StringInternUtils illegal access\r\n- Refactored nifi-enrich-processors tests to use Mockito without Powermock\r\n- Refactored nifi-toolkit-tls tests to avoid illegal reflective access\r\n- Removed deprecated X509Certificate test in CertificateUtilsTest\r\n- Removed kryo serialization from nifi-site-to-site-client test\r\n- Updated TestHashContent to use SHA-1 instead of SHA for hash algorithm\r\n- Upgraded maven-war-plugin from 2.5 to 3.3.2\r\n- Upgraded nifi-graph-bundle dependencies from Groovy 2.5.14 to 3.0.8\r\n- Upgraded QuestDB from 4.2.1 to 6.2.1 in nifi-framework-core\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

The second command mimics the command after this change.  With the change, build output like the following should be present:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] --- maven-checkstyle-plugin:3.1.2:check (check-style) @ nifi-system-test-suite ---\r\n...\r\n[INFO] --- apache-rat-plugin:0.13:check (default) @ nifi-system-test-suite ---\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9797 Corrects the `AccessToken.isExpired()` calculation using `5` seconds instead of `5000` seconds.  The current expiry margin value of `5000` results in incorrect expiration determination due to the OAuth2 `expiresIn` property being set in seconds. Additional changes include a new test for `AccessToken` and updates to existing unit tests.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9796 Updates the NiFi Registry Spring Security configuration to avoid warning log messages as a result of using `WebSecurity.ignoring().antMatchers()`.  Following the approach recommended in the message, the updated configuration uses the `HttpSecurity.authorizeRequests().antMatchers()` strategy to allow all clients to access the specified paths.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9793 Updates the `NiFiClientUtil` class for `nifi-system-test-suite` with a new wait method to check Controller Service run status before continuing. This check avoids occasional HTTP 409 Conflict responses when subsequent methods attempt to delete Controller Services while destroying the test flow.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

I found the issue using [NonDex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex):\r\n```\r\nmvn install -DskipTests -pl nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors -am\r\nmvn -pl nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:1.1.2:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.TestAttributesToCSV#testSchemaToContent\r\n```\r\nIn the same test class, `testSchemaToContent`, `testSchemaWithCoreAttribuesToAttribute`, `testSchemaWithCoreAttribuesToContent` can also fail due to the same reason. \r\n\r\nThe original proposed fix changes several `HashMap` to `LinkedHashMap`. But this change would cause  other test to fail: `org.apache.nifi.remote.protocol.http.TestHttpFlowFileServerProtocol.testTransferTwoFiles`. \r\n\r\nThe current solution changes the assertion the endure the indeterminate behavior of HashMap. Instead of comparing strings, the commit converts the strings into lists using the existed function `getStrings`. Then, I wrote a helper function `zipToMap` that converts two lists into a map. It makes sure items in `CSVData` and `CSVSchema` are matched, but also ignores the order in the list. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9763 Escapes the `VALUE` column in the insert SQL statement for creating records in the `CONFIGURE_DETAILS` table, which NiFi uses for auditing flow configuration history. This change is necessary as a result of upgrading to H2 database version 2.1, which made `VALUE` a reserved word.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9761 Corrects `PeerChannel` handling of TLS 1.3 post-handshake messages, avoiding unexpected behavior when attempting to read from the underlying `SocketChannel` after previous calls have already put data in the stream buffer. This resolves a latent issue with Load-Balanced Connections and TLS 1.3 communication.\r\n\r\nThe new `TestPeerChannel` leverages a simple socket server based on Netty to confirm expected behavior for both TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-04T19:07:36Z","updated_at":"2022-03-09T20:15:52Z","closed_at":"2022-03-09T20:15:52Z","merged_at":"2022-03-09T20:15:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"c73573b325a6e370bb3031e6906c786bcbf72ebc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5836/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5836/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5836/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/58ac2f980a416886be7226b178eb6d3982b8c667","head":{"label":"exceptionfactory:NIFI-9761","ref":"NIFI-9761","sha":"58ac2f980a416886be7226b178eb6d3982b8c667","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":297800463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc4MDA0NjM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"exceptionfactory/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory/nifi","description":"Apache

Description of PR\r\n\r\nCurrently we display the internal name for a dependent property's value(s) which does not match the rest of the documentation which uses display names. This PR changes that to use the display name so it matches the rest of the documentation.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9735 Corrects the NiFi Jetty documentation servlet configuration to avoid the following warning:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARN [main] o.e.j.webapp.StandardDescriptorProcessor Duplicate mapping from / to default\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `JettyServer.addDocsServlets()` method included a servlet mapping for the root context path, which unnecessarily overrides the default servlet mapping defined in `webdefault.xml`.  Removing this mapping eliminates the warning and maintains current web application behavior.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9736 Improves `TestRouteText.testPatternCache` to avoid intermittent failures due to maximum cache size checking. Changes from Guava to Caffeine altered the cache eviction behavior, resulting in intermittent failures.  The current method fills up the cache, which is an expensive operation for testing. The updated method avoids filling up the cache and simplifies the test method.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking.

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9734 Standardizes exception cause message formatting to follow standard Java logging conventions, listing the direct cause first and the root cause last.  This approach reverses the current order where the message lists the root cause first and the direct cause last.\r\n\r\nThe `TestSimpleProcessorLogger` changes illustrate the expected output, which appears as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: FIRST\r\n- Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: SECOND\r\n- Caused by: java.lang.SecurityException: THIRD\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is
