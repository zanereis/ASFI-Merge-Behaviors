The reason was\n<code>/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code> not being the first or second entry in the JAR file; now this manifest file is the second entry. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/20976\">#20976</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v5.1.1</h2>\n<p>This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast Platform 5.1.1 release.

href=\"https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/releases\">jetty-maven-plugin's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>11.0.0</h2>\n<h1>Eclipse Jetty 11.x Highlights</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Jetty 11.x has a minimum Java requirement of Java 11.</li>\n<li>Jetty 11.x modules are proper JPMS modules with <code>module-info.class</code>.</li>\n<li>Jetty 11.x supports the following technology specs (from the Jakarta EE 9 effort):\n<ul>\n<li><code>jakarta.servlet</code> - 5.0.0</li>\n<li><code>jakarta.servlet.jsp</code> - 3.0.0</li>\n<li><code>jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl</code> - 2.0.0</li>\n<li><code>jakarta.el</code> - 4.0.0</li>\n<li><code>jakarta.websocket</code> - 2.0.0</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Jetty 11.x is the first major version of Jetty to support the <code>jakarta.servlet</code> namespace.<br />\nUse Jetty 10.x for the older (now outdated) <code>javax.servlet</code> namespace.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Important Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Classic jetty logging facade has been replaced with slf4j-api usage</li>\n<li>There is no longer a <code>jetty-distribution</code>, use <code>jetty-home</code> with a proper <code>${jetty.base}</code> instead.<br />\nSee: <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/10.0.0/operations-guide/index.html#og-begin-arch\">Operations Guide: Architecture</a>\n<ul>\n<li>New <code>demo</code> jetty-start module exists to replace the old demo-base functionality.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Remove jetty-all uber artifact</li>\n<li>Managing <code>Configuration</code> within a <code>WebAppContext</code> has a new API.<br />\n(They are now self ordering and do not require knowledge of Jetty internals to use successfully)</li>\n<li>Complete WebSocket refactoring, those using the Jetty APIs or embedded-jetty will need to update their code.\n<ul>\n<li>Support for WebSocket over HTTP/2 (client and server)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Jetty HttpClient has been improved.\n<ul>\n<li>Supports dynamic protocol upgrade (http/2 and http/1.1).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Session management has been refactored as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Changelog</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a

for aborting cache segment download using the environment variable <code>SEGMENT_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_MIN</code>. Default is 60 minutes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v3.0.7</h2>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for the download stuck problem has been added in actions/cache for users who were intermittently facing the issue. As part of this fix, new timeout has been introduced in the download step to stop the download if it doesn't complete within an hour and run the rest of the workflow without erroring out.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v3.0.6</h2>\n<h3>What's Changed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Add example for clojure lein project dependencies by <a href=\"https://github.com/shivamarora1\"><code>@​shivamarora1</code></a> in PR <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/pull/835\">actions/cache#835</a></li>\n<li>Update toolkit's cache npm module to latest.

(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/issues/624\">actions/cache#624</a>)</p>\n<h2>v3.0.2</h2>\n<p>This release adds the support for dynamic cache size cap on GHES.</p>\n<h2>v3.0.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for caching from GHES 3.5.</li>\n<li>Fixed download issue for files &gt; 2GB during restore.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v3.0.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>This change adds a minimum runner version(node12 -&gt; node16), which can break users using an out-of-date/fork of the runner. This would be most commonly affecting users on GHES 3.3 or before, as those runners do not support node16 actions and they can use actions from github.com via <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/github-actions/managing-access-to-actions-from-githubcom/enabling-automatic-access-to-githubcom-actions-using-github-connect\">github connect</a> or manually copying the repo to their GHES instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Few dependencies and cache action usage examples have also been updated.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Fix integration test package versions\n- Update various dependencies:\n\n<!--\nFor Security Vulnerabilities, please email: security@shiro.apache.org\nFor more details on how to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\n-->\n\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\n\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \n \nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\n \nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\n\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\n\n

[SHIRO-512](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-512)\r\nFixes https://github.com/flowlogix/flowlogix/issues/284\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [X] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [X] In

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

SHIRO-887.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where passwords which start and/or end with spaces are trimmed by the FormAuthenticationFilter, which prevents login for users with such passwords.\r\n\r\n**Note:** I am a first time contributor, so I have no CLA signed yet. In order to fulfill the contribution guidelines, I have sent the signed CLA to the Apache Software Foundations secretary office.\r\n\r\n**Update 2022/07/30:** CLA is acknowledge.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor Security Vulnerabilities, please email: security@shiro.apache.org\r\nFor more details on how to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-838) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

on the pending vote.\r\nAt least snapshot deployments are done via the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin`. \r\nI have not checked whether the server configuration is still correct.\r\n\r\nI checked the success by running `mvn deploy -DskipTests -pl samples/web -am -DdeployAtEnd=true`.\r\n\r\nThe result was:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] --- nexus-staging-maven-plugin:1.6.8:deploy (injected-nexus-deploy) @ samples-web ---\r\n[INFO] Skipping Nexus Staging Deploy Mojo at user's demand.\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-867) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [X] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [X] In

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [X] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [X] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\nThis would improve the usage for the user because it's not need to manually call `apache-rat:check` because it's part of the usual build.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [X] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [X] In

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

Fixes SHIRO-842\r\n- removes all log4j1 usages (test usages)\r\n- replaces \"test if logged\" with LoggerContextRule\r\n\r\nTBD:\r\n- [x] Need to remove the code cleanup from my IDE\r\n- [x] Replace all `log4j.properties` with `log4j2.xml`\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

from 1.9.x\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

more broken links.\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

fallback.","created_at":"2022-01-14T23:26:49Z","updated_at":"2023-01-30T21:17:09Z","closed_at":"2023-01-30T21:17:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"33971ac3a38ad022a983f28e45721c61eebc60c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/332/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/332/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/332/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/statuses/1aa455e378022fb28f558f5c81848bebef5d682a","head":{"label":"apache:jcache","ref":"jcache","sha":"1aa455e378022fb28f558f5c81848bebef5d682a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":291570,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTE1NzA=","name":"shiro","full_name":"apache/shiro","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro","description":"Apache

plugin-update for 2.0.0\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [X] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [X] In

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

request is already far gone and it's hopeless to save, so some kind of Error is perfectly fine. But the NPE suggest a programming error in the software while this is rather a normal operation.\r\n\r\nThis patch just makes this more clear by throwing an IllegalStateException instead of the NullPointerException.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find existing unit tests for this class, but let me know if you wan't me to add a unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-04T11:28:20Z","updated_at":"2022-01-15T21:16:13Z","closed_at":"2022-01-15T20:13:31Z","merged_at":"2022-01-15T20:13:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"da7448f0f97b6758d20d9ea83ce1f77dd669182a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/329/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/329/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/329/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/statuses/0ba786e1fcc1f4f582c1af7ead6da4f652216680","head":{"label":"zeroflag:SHIRO-841","ref":"SHIRO-841","sha":"0ba786e1fcc1f4f582c1af7ead6da4f652216680","user":{"login":"zeroflag","id":641365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTM2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag","html_url":"https://github.com/zeroflag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":424563231,"node_id":"R_kgDOGU5SHw","name":"shiro","full_name":"zeroflag/shiro","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zeroflag","id":641365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTM2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag","html_url":"https://github.com/zeroflag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zeroflag/shiro","description":"Apache

from main and resolved conflicts.\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-840) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [X] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [X] In

Commit  https://github.com/apache/shiro/pull/322/commits/06160bcaf40ed37fe78d7ab70769265cdc42e5b9 from PR https://github.com/apache/shiro/pull/322 and resolved merge conflicts.\r\n\r\nThis basically reverts https://github.com/apache/shiro/pull/306 and uses mojohaus' plugin again.\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [X] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [X] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-26T10:01:11Z","updated_at":"2021-09-28T13:10:24Z","closed_at":"2021-09-28T13:10:21Z","merged_at":"2021-09-28T13:10:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"a52171f7cc2d3a0b7d6599b8ff7e6acfaa8bb85b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/milestones/1/labels","id":5478228,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTQ3ODIyOA==","number":1,"title":"2.0","description":null,"creator":{"login":"bdemers","id":99954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5OTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers","html_url":"https://github.com/bdemers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":55,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-29T14:27:07Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T17:03:03Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2024-02-28T17:03:03Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/323/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/323/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/323/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/statuses/39192e3321ae9071b50c76cd393b7845bfe843b5","head":{"label":"bmarwell:SHIRO-828_aspectj-maven-plugin_for-main","ref":"SHIRO-828_aspectj-maven-plugin_for-main","sha":"39192e3321ae9071b50c76cd393b7845bfe843b5","user":{"login":"bmarwell","id":1413391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTMzOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1413391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell","html_url":"https://github.com/bmarwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:main","ref":"main","sha":"a6b0318798993193961e45e3709b4bada9f3300f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":291570,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTE1NzA=","name":"shiro","full_name":"apache/shiro","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscrip

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [x] In

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-678) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-802) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-825: Trailing slash in URI results in \"IllegalArgumentException: There is no configured chain under the name/key\"\r\n\r\nWhen the request URI has a trailing slash, but the pattern does not have a trailing slash (or vice versa), it is still supposed to match. However, when they don't match exactly, we enter the `else` branch where the call to `filterChainManager.proxy()` has the incorrect parameter! (When they match exactly, the call to `filterChainManager.proxy()` has the correct parameter -- see line 114).\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a copy/paste error introduced by commit https://github.com/apache/shiro/commit/ab1ea4a2006f6bd6a2b5f72740b7135662f8f160#diff-a724e4e5fde47ea6cc29803d5a4581a299b74f09d4ec5ce047e7d3e056116815R129\r\n\r\nIn Shiro 1.7.0, it didn't have this duplicate code, and it was working correctly.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

- do not map the class AuthorizationException itself (for now).\r\n   This exception is only thrown from the aop support (which might need to be changed to a subclass)\r\n   and from Jdbc/Ldap-Realms. But those should lead to internal server errors, as\r\n   internal code has thrown an exception.\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue SHIRO-818](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-818) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

stated behavior is not the observed.\r\n\r\nThis is a complement to: https://github.com/apache/shiro-site/pull/82\r\n\r\nThe relevant section of the [commons-configuration class](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-configuration/apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/interpol/ConfigurationInterpolator.html) is:\r\n\r\n> After an instance has been created *it does not contain any Lookup objects*. The current set of lookup objects can be modified using the registerLookup() and deregisterLookup() methods. *Default lookup objects (that are invoked for variables without a prefix)* can be added or removed with the addDefaultLookup() and removeDefaultLookup() methods respectively. (When a ConfigurationInterpolator instance is created by a configuration object, a default lookup object is added pointing to the configuration itself, so that variables are resolved using the configuration's properties.)\r\n\r\nSo, the correct behavior is that you can use `${const:java.awt.event.KeyEvent.VK_ENTER}` but not `${env:EDITOR}`.  The current code accepts `${EDITOR}`. If a system property with this name is found not null, it is used, if not, an environment variable is search and if not, the whole substitution `${EDITOR}` is returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-18T01:09:47Z","updated_at":"2022-06-08T11:48:46Z","closed_at":"2021-05-27T18:20:13Z","merged_at":"2021-05-27T18:20:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"1c97815737fee587729b1d3827814f3f58d2b6ec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/302/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/302/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/302/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/statuses/21d7562856528bcea7f081276e6a2232a4458e9d","head":{"label":"weltonrodrigo:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"21d7562856528bcea7f081276e6a2232a4458e9d","user":{"login":"weltonrodrigo","id":1644644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1644644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weltonrodrigo","html_url":"https://github.com/weltonrodrigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weltonrodrigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weltonrodrigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weltonrodrigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weltonrodrigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weltonrodrigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weltonrodrigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weltonrodrigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weltonrodrigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weltonrodrigo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:main","ref":"main","sha":"5354e1ab31dfdbbe4f2910b7cf300d873d9cda8b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":291570,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTE1NzA=","name":"shiro","full_name":"apache/shiro","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro","description":"Apache

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using
