Instead of dispatching the processing in the thread pool directly, we chain the element processing onto the output future of the last element with the same key, to ensure the ordering by key.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

part of the [Beam Release Process](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/release-guide/), the following PR includes the workflow to run the

Verify Release Branch - Run automation script](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/release-guide/#run-automation-script-verify_release_buildsh).\r\n\r\nFiles: \r\n* Composite action to install GitHub CLI in linux: `.github/actions/setup-gh-cli-linux/action.yml`\r\n* Verify Release Workflow: `.github/workflows/verify_release_build.yml`\r\n* Script to comment Trigger Phrases in batch in the given Pull Request: `scripts/ci/release/comment_pr_trigger_phrases.sh` \r\n    * `scripts/ci/release/mass_comment.txt` file where are included the same Trigger Phrases that are in the [mass_comment.py](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/release/src/main/scripts/mass_comment.py) file.\r\n    * `scripts/ci/release/jenkins_trigger_phrases.txt` where are included the Release Gradle Build job and some PostCommit and PreCommits jobs that will not be migrated to GitHub Actions in the first iteration of the massive migration. \r\n    \r\n`* Note`: Currently, the `verify_release_build` workflow is pointing to the `mass_comment.txt` file when commenting Trigger Phrases as we don't have enabled Trigger Phrases for PostCommit and PreCommit GitHub Actions workflows yet and also, we haven't migrated those jobs. Once there are in place, feel free to update the workflow to call the PostCommits and PreCommits workflows as well as pointing to the `jenkins_trigger_phrases.txt` file which includes some of those jobs that are missing in GitHub Actions. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR:\r\n1. Adds a Gradle task to do all post-checkout tasks.\r\n2. Adds a Python script to extract Beam symbols from Python SDK.\r\n3. Adds a Gradle task to call that script and to place the symbols so that the frontend app can use them.\r\n4. Updates a frontend Dockerfile to do the same.\r\n5. Updates the README explaining those changes.\r\n\r\nThe symbols are not yet used by the app after loading. The app will start using them when the Akvelon editor replaces the old editor. Still this PR is needed for easier testing of the Akvelon editor before the switch and to simplify. It also simplifies post-checkout tasks.\r\n\r\n- Resolves #23304\r\n- Resolves #23917\r\n- Resolves #23534\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

issue is that readDefaultLine and readCustomLine was incorrectly calculating the appendLength when the buffer returned was 0 length. This was solved by ensuring that the internal read loop always read at least one byte allowing for the code to ensure that we were making progress. For readDefaultLine we kept track of whether we need to skip an LF in the next buffer if the current buffer ended with a CR and for readCustomLine we had to remember how much of the delimiter we have read so far in this buffer.\r\n\r\nThe bug was introduced in https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/30a48f05cf2ee0eea0a304fea01eb40f323f9f3c\r\n\r\nThere was no noticeable change in the TextSourceBenchmark performance results.\r\n\r\nFixes #23375\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#23308\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new module, `apache_beam.typehints.testing.strategies`, with `hypothesis` strategies for generating schema complex schema types. It also uses the strategy to exercise the conversion logic in `apache_beam.typehints.schemas`. This testing revealed a minor issue with schema ids in nested data, which is also patched in this PR.\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master

#23264\r\n\r\nIn #23012, testing with `on_success_matcher` is switched out for `hamcrest_assert(p, bq_matcher)` because it is less noisy and more accurate.\r\n\r\nHowever, [PostCommits test with `TestDirectRunner`](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/468e02b7c1f41f25543edbafb84becb07974eebe/sdks/python/test-suites/direct/common.gradle#L169-L177). The problem is that `TestDirectRunner` does not run the pipeline without the `on_success_matcher` argument. \r\n\r\nError results because `hamcrest_assert` queries a table that the pipeline is supposed to create.

Instead, setting the options <code>stale-issue-message</code> and <code>stale-pr-message</code> will be enough to let the stale workflow add a comment. If the options are unset, a comment will not be added which was the equivalent of setting <code>skip-stale-issue-message</code> to <code>true</code>.</li>\n<li>The <code>operations-per-run</code> option will be more effective. After migrating, you could face a failed-fast process workflow if you let the default value (30) or set it to a small number. In that case, you will see a warning at the end of the logs (if enabled) indicating that the workflow was stopped sooner to avoid consuming too much API calls. In most cases, you can just increase this limit to make sure to process everything in a single run.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/commit/3de2653986ebd134983c79fe2be5d45cc3d9f4e1\"><code>3de2653</code></a> Update changelog for v6.0.0 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/stale/issues/829\">#829</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/commit/02e44c81cc3144e8817a5686f3d7c24658f6f1e6\"><code>02e44c8</code></a> fix(options)!: Make <code>not_planned</code> the default <code>close-issue-reason</code> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/stale/issues/807\">#807</a>)</li>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/compare/v5...v6\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=actions/stale&package-manager=github_actions&previous-version=5&new-version=6)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

patch adds a thread pool in the DoFnRunner of Samza runner to execute DoFn.ProcessElement in parallel within a Samza task. This allows greater parallelism beyond a single task/partition. Users can specify the number of threads in the ExecutorService, and also be allowed to provide customized executor service. Under the hood, we provide another layer of DoFnRunner to parallelize the calls and pass the futures down to the Samza async engine.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

issue https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/22146 (also reported on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73765145/apache-beam-illegalstateexception-value-only-available-at-runtime-after-upgra)).\r\n\r\n[ValueProvider](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/current/org/apache/beam/sdk/options/ValueProvider.html) can be used to pass runtime parameters not available during pipeline creation (which is heavily used by [Dataflow Templates](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/dataflow-templates)).\r\n\r\nIn case a `RuntimeValueProvider` is being used, using `.get()` will throw the following exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Value only available at runtime, but accessed from a non-runtime context: RuntimeValueProvider{propertyName=spannerInstanceId, default=defaultinstanceid}\r\n        at org.apache.beam.sdk.options.ValueProvider$RuntimeValueProvider.get(ValueProvider.java:254)\r\n        at org.apache.beam.sdk.io.gcp.spanner.SpannerConfig.withInstanceId(SpannerConfig.java:165)\r\n        at .... my code constructing SpannerConfig ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo my changes adjust that behavior, to validate only if there is a reference to a provider, but not trying to use the value.\r\nIdeally those can be validated elsewhere when not using the ValueProvider (the other entry methods do not specify `@Nullable`, so that should be handled already). \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
