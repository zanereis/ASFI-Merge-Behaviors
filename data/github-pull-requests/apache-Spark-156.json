What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPreviously CustomMetrics use Class.getCanonicalName when attempting to get the\r\nclass name of CustomMetric implementations. These names replace special characters\r\nfor marking inner classes like ($) with \".\". While those names are appropriate for\r\nreferring to classes within source files, they will not work during reflection where\r\nthe Class.getName output should be used.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nInnerClasses could never be found in when they are used as Custom Metrics\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests modified so they access both an independent metric class as well as an inner class.","created_at":"2021-10-20T22:44:43Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T03:43:09Z","closed_at":"2021-10-21T00:59:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8200a510ed89f0e2803e03a05d3175e46fcdb993","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPreviously CustomMetrics use Class.getCanonicalName when attempting to get the\r\nclass name of CustomMetric implementations. These names replace special characters\r\nfor marking inner classes like ($) with \".\". While those names are appropriate for\r\nreferring to classes within source files, they will not work during reflection where\r\nthe Class.getName output should be used.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nInnerClasses could never be found in when they are used as Custom Metrics\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests modified so they access both an independent metric class as well as an inner

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that the string returned by `StructType.toString` is different between Scala 2.12 and 2.13.\r\n\r\n* Scala 2.12\r\n```\r\nval st = StructType(StructField(\"a\", IntegerType) :: Nil)\r\nst.toString\r\nres0: String = StructType(StructField(a,IntegerType,true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Scala 2.13\r\n```\r\nval st = StructType(StructField(\"a\", IntegerType) :: Nil)\r\nst.toString\r\nval res0: String = Seq(StructField(a,IntegerType,true))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's because the logic to make the prefix of the string was changed from Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\nScala 2.12: https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.12.15/src/library/scala/collection/TraversableLike.scala#L804\r\nScala 2:13:https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.13.5/src/library/scala/collection/Seq.scala#L46\r\n\r\nOne option which solves this issue would be to override `className` because it's used as the prefix of the string returned by `toString`.\r\nhttps://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.13.5/src/library/scala/collection/Iterable.scala#L76\r\n\r\nBut it doesn't works with Scala 2.12 because `className` was introduced from Scala 2.12.\r\nAnother option would be to override `stringPrefix` and this should work with both Scala 2.12 and 2.13.\r\nhttps://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.12.15/src/library/scala/collection/TraversableLike.scala#L796\r\nhttps://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.13.5/src/library/scala/collection/Iterable.scala#L56\r\n\r\nBut we need to make the method `public` for Scala 2.12 though it is expected to be used only from `toString`, while the method is `private[this]` for Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\nSo, rather than exposing a new public method, this PR proposes to implement `Struct.toString` explicitly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo fix a kind of compatibility issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds a new internal interface `FunctionExpressionBuilder`, to replace `SessionCatalog.makeFunctionExpression`. Then we can put the interface implementation in sql/core, to avoid using reflection in `SessionCatalog.makeFunctionExpression`, because the class `UserDefinedAggregateFunction` is not available in sql/catalyst.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUse `ZoneId.of()` to handle timezone string in `DatetimeUtils.stringToTimestamp()`\r\ninstead of manually splitting it into hours and minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn current implementation. we will split the timezone string into hours and minutes.\r\nBut if there is no colon in the timezone, the full digits will be treated as hours, then\r\nwe couldn't get the correct value.\r\nFor example:\r\n`2021-10-11T03:58:03.000+0700` will return null, but \"+0700\" is actually correct\r\nformat that accepted by `ZoneId.of()`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nbugfix. this allows Spark to accept a more valid timezone format.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nnewly added UT\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-20T04:40:51Z","updated_at":"2021-10-22T13:33:18Z","closed_at":"2021-10-22T13:31:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a541f86425e1d6b9c56ff20e563b8a16938370a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34338/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34338/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34338/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cc0dc14d710162c87208318187890ad5878da934","head":{"label":"linhongliu-db:SPARK-37067","ref":"SPARK-37067","sha":"cc0dc14d710162c87208318187890ad5878da934","user":{"login":"linhongliu-db","id":67896261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODk2MjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67896261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db","html_url":"https://github.com/linhongliu-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":289223205,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODkyMjMyMDU=","name":"spark","full_name":"linhongliu-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"linhongliu-db","id":67896261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODk2MjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67896261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db","html_url":"https://github.com/linhongliu-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/linhongliu-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pr pull out complex sorting expressions if it is global sorting to reduce the evaluation of complex expressions. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT id AS a, id AS b FROM range(10) ORDER BY a - b\r\n```\r\nBefore this pr:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n+- Sort [(a#0L - b#1L) ASC NULLS FIRST], true, 0\r\n   +- Exchange rangepartitioning((a#0L - b#1L) ASC NULLS FIRST, 5), ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS, [id=#12]\r\n      +- Project [id#2L AS a#0L, id#2L AS b#1L]\r\n         +- Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=2)\r\n```\r\nAfter this pr:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n+- Project [a#0L, b#1L]\r\n   +- Sort [_sortingexpression#5L ASC NULLS FIRST], true, 0\r\n      +- Exchange rangepartitioning(_sortingexpression#5L ASC NULLS FIRST, 5), ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS, [id=#16]\r\n         +- Project [id#2L AS a#0L, id#2L AS b#1L, (id#2L - id#2L) AS _sortingexpression#5L]\r\n            +- Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove order performance if the sorting expressions contains complex expressions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test and benchmark test:\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.benchmark.Benchmark\r\nval numRows = 1024 * 1024 * 10\r\nspark.sql(s\"CREATE TABLE t1 using parquet AS select id AS a, id AS b FROM range(${numRows}L)\")\r\nval benchmark = new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce a new data source having short name as \"rate-micro-batch\", which produces similar input rows as \"rate\" (increment long values with timestamps), but ensures that each micro-batch has a \"predictable\" set of input rows.\r\n\r\n\"rate-micro-batch\" data source receives a config to specify the number of rows per micro-batch, which defines the set of input rows for further micro-batches. For example, if the number of rows per micro-batch is set to 1000, the first batch would have 1000 rows having value range as `0~999`, the second batch would have 1000 rows having value range as `1000~1999`, and so on. This characteristic brings different use cases compared to rate data source, as we can't predict the input rows for rate data source like this.\r\n\r\nFor generated time (timestamp column), the data source applies the same mechanism to make the value of column be predictable. `startTimestamp` option defines the starting value of generated time, and `advanceMillisPerBatch` option defines how much time the generated time should advance per micro-batch. All input rows in the same micro-batch will have same timestamp.\r\n\r\nThis source supports the following options:\r\n\r\n* `rowsPerBatch` (e.g. 100): How many rows should be generated per micro-batch.\r\n* `numPartitions` (e.g. 10, default: Spark's default parallelism): The partition number for the generated rows.\r\n* `startTimestamp` (e.g. 1000, default: 0): starting value of generated time\r\n* `advanceMillisPerBatch` (e.g. 1000, default: 1000): the amount of time being advanced in generated time on each micro-batch.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe \"rate\" data source has been known to be used as a benchmark for streaming query.\r\n\r\nWhile this helps to put the query to the limit (how many rows the query could process per second), the rate data source doesn't provide consistent rows per batch into stream, which leads two environments be hard to compare with.\r\n\r\nFor example, in many cases, you may want to compare the metrics in the batches between test environments (like running same streaming query with different options). These metrics are strongly affected if the distribution of input rows in batches are changing, especially a micro-batch has been lagged (in any reason) and rate data source produces more input rows to the next batch.\r\n\r\nAlso, when you test against streaming aggregation, you may want the data source produces the same set of input rows per batch (deterministic), so that you can plan how these input rows will be aggregated and how state rows will be evicted, and craft the test query based on the plan.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, end users can leverage a new data source in micro-batch mode of streaming query to test/benchmark.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UTs, and manually tested via below query in spark-shell:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.readStream.format(\"rate-micro-batch\").option(\"rowsPerBatch\", 20).option(\"numPartitions\", 3).load().writeStream.format(\"console\").start()\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-19T22:20:42Z","updated_at":"2021-11-01T11:04:28Z","closed_at":"2021-11-01T11:04:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ad612c5a708c98e8be627b583f89c6c635a1df4c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `Row` to `__all__` in `pyspark.sql.types`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`Row` is defined `pyspark.sql.types`, but exported only from `pyspark.sql`. However it is not used consistently: \r\n\r\n- It is imported, exchangeably with `pyspark.sql`,  from `pyspark.sql.types` in some of the examples.\r\n- It is imported, exchangeably with `pyspark.sql`, from `pyspark.sql.types` if different places in the codebase.\r\n\r\nAlso, it is used in some 3rd party examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Currently\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import *\r\n```\r\n\r\nwon't import `Row`. It will however, after this change is merged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAfter an improvement in SPARK-31486, contributor uses 'asyncSendToMasterAndForwardReply' method instead of 'activeMasterEndpoint.askSync' to get the status of driver. Since the driver's status is only available in active master and the 'asyncSendToMasterAndForwardReply' method iterate over all of the masters, we have to handle the response from the backup masters in the client, which the developer did not consider in the SPARK-31486 change. So drivers running in cluster mode and on a cluster with multi masters affected by this bug. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe need to find if the response received from a backup master client must ignore it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, It's only fixed a bug and brings back the ability to deploy in cluster mode on multi-master clusters.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

These changes fix the repr to be valid with python.\r\n\r\nThe [motivation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr) is \"to return a string that would yield an object with the same value when passed to eval()\".\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nCurrent implementation:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import *\r\n\r\nstruct = StructType([StructField('f1', StringType(), True)])\r\nrepr(struct)\r\n# StructType(List(StructField(f1,StringType,true)))\r\nnew_struct = eval(repr(struct))\r\n# Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n#   File \"<input>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n#   File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n# NameError: name 'List' is not defined\r\n\r\nstruct_field = StructField('f1', StringType(), True)\r\nrepr(struct_field)\r\n# StructField(f1,StringType,true)\r\nnew_struct_field = eval(repr(struct_field))\r\n# Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n#   File \"<input>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n#   File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n# NameError: name 'f1' is not defined\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith changes:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import *\r\n\r\nstruct = StructType([StructField('f1', StringType(), True)])\r\nrepr(struct)\r\n# StructType([StructField('f1', StringType(), True)])\r\nnew_struct = eval(repr(struct))\r\nstruct == new_struct\r\n# True\r\n\r\nstruct_field = StructField('f1', StringType(), True)\r\nrepr(struct_field)\r\n# StructField('f1', StringType(), True)\r\nnew_struct_field = eval(repr(struct_field))\r\nstruct_field == new_struct_field\r\n# True\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nThe changes include a test which asserts that an instance of each type is equal to the `eval` of its `repr`, as in the above example.\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-19T02:42:38Z","updated_at":"2022-03-23T13:59:50Z","closed_at":"2022-03-23T13:59:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9a1b1e36a50a2829edbb6c297e53287bc3a25381","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34320/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34320/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34320/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9baa5b7cdf35794fb4f49fe3d535309f89bcfde1","head":{"label":"crflynn:sql-types-repr","ref":"sql-types-repr","sha":"9baa5b7cdf35794fb4f49fe3d535309f89bcfde1","user":{"login":"crflynn","id":16403734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDAzNzM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16403734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crflynn","html_url":"https://github.com/crflynn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crflynn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crflynn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crflynn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crflynn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crflynn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crflynn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crflynn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crflynn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crflynn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":418719613,"node_id":"R_kgDOGPUnfQ","name":"spark","full_name":"crflynn/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"crflynn","id":16403734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDAzNzM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16403734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crflynn","html_url":"https://github.com/crflynn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crflynn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crflynn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crflynn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crflynn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crflynn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crflynn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crflynn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crflynn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crflynn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/crflynn/spark","description":"Apache

added the support to respect `spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout` in `ExecutorPodsAllocator`. However, when it checks if a pending executor pod is timed out, it checks against the pod's [startTime](https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/2a5dae08c42b1e8fdc1379432d8898efece65363/core/v1/types.go#L3664-L3667), see code [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/c2ba498ff678ddda034cedf45cc17fbeefe922fd/resource-managers/kubernetes/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/cluster/k8s/ExecutorPodsAllocator.scala#L459). A pending pod `startTime` is empty, and this causes the function `isExecutorIdleTimedOut()` always return true for pending pods.\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced locally, run the following job\r\n\r\n```\r\n${SPARK_HOME}/bin/spark-submit --master k8s://http://localhost:8001 --deploy-mode cluster --name spark-group-example \\\r\n  --master k8s://http://localhost:8001 --deploy-mode cluster \\\r\n  --class org.apache.spark.examples.GroupByTest \\\r\n  --conf spark.executor.instances=1 \\\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.namespace=spark-test \\\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.executor.request.cores=1 \\\r\n  --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=true \\\r\n  --conf spark.shuffle.service.enabled=true \\\r\n  --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.shuffleTracking.enabled=true \\\r\n  --conf spark.shuffle.service.enabled=false \\\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=local/spark:3.3.0 \\\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.authenticate.driver.serviceAccountName=spark \\\r\n  local:///opt/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples_2.12-3.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \\\r\n  1000 1000 100 1000\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe local cluster doesn't have enough resources to run more than 4 executors, the rest of the executor pods will be pending.

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nColumn case was lost when we did an alter view because we would not save schema information in table properties for datasource tables when doing an alter view.\r\nThe fix proposed is to save the required properties in table props in the alter codepath\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a bug as schema case information is lost. Repro\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"create view v as select 1 as A, 1 as B\")\r\nres2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"describe v\").collect.foreach(println)\r\n[A,int,null]\r\n[B,int,null]\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"alter view v as select 1 as C, 1 as D\")\r\nres4: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"describe v\").collect.foreach(println)\r\n[c,int,null]\r\n[d,int,null]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Now on an alter view, user will see column case preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCancel running job after AQE plan finished, so this PR add a `runningStages` in `AdaptiveExecutionContext` to record the running stages.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe see stage was still running after AQE plan finished. This is because the plan which contains a join with one empty side has been converted to `LocalTableScanExec` during `AQEOptimizer`, but the other side of this join is still running (shuffle map stage).\r\n\r\nIt's no meaning to keep running the stage, so It's better to cancel the running stage after AQE plan finished in case wasting the task resource.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe following sql has different behavior when using Java 8 and Java 17\r\n\r\n```\r\n--PostgreSQL throw ERROR:  format specifies argument 0, but arguments are numbered from 1\r\nselect format_string('%0$s', 'Hello');\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Use Java 8**\r\n\r\n```\r\n-- !query\r\nselect format_string('%0$s', 'Hello')\r\n-- !query schema\r\nstruct<format_string(%0$s, Hello):string>\r\n-- !query output\r\nHello\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Use Java 17**\r\n\r\n```\r\n-- !query\r\nselect format_string('%0$s', 'Hello')\r\n-- !query schema\r\nstruct<>\r\n-- !query output\r\njava.util.IllegalFormatArgumentIndexException\r\nIllegal format argument index = 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe difference in this behavior comes from  the change of `j.u.Formatter.FormatSpecifier.index` method: \r\n\r\nJava 8\r\n\r\n```\r\n        private int index(String s) {\r\n            if (s != null) {\r\n                try {\r\n                    index = Integer.parseInt(s.substring(0, s.length() - 1));\r\n                } catch (NumberFormatException x) {\r\n                    assert(false);\r\n                }\r\n            } else {\r\n                index = 0;\r\n            }\r\n            return index;\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nJava 17\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        private void index(String s, int start, int end) {\r\n            if (start >= 0) {\r\n                try {\r\n                    // skip the trailing '$'\r\n                    index = Integer.parseInt(s, start, end - 1, 10);\r\n                    if (index <= 0) {\r\n                       throw new IllegalFormatArgumentIndexException(index);\r\n                    }\r\n                } catch (NumberFormatException x) {\r\n                    throw new IllegalFormatArgumentIndexException(Integer.MIN_VALUE);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nA `index <= 0` condition is added here to ensure `%0$` as a  `IllegalFormatArgumentIndexException` expression.\r\n\r\nSo the main change of this pr is add a require check to `FormatString` to manually disable `%0$` to ensure that Java 17 and Java 8 have the same behavior.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPass UT with JDK 17\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe wrong usage like `format_string('%0$s', str)` can no longer be used, which is also consistent with PostgreSQL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n- Manual test `mvn clean install -pl sql/core -am -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite` with Java 11 and  Java 17

It will dramatically reduce the transferred data size and improve performance if we can push Sample to data source side.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. new interface `SupportsPushDownTableSample`\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nUnify the compare function of `UTF8String` and `ByteArray`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`BinaryType` use `TypeUtils.compareBinary` to compare two byte array, however it's slow since it compares byte array using unsigned int comparison byte by bye.\r\n\r\nWe can compare them using `Platform.getLong` with unsigned long comparison if they have more than 8 bytes. And here is some histroy about this `TODO` https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/6755/files#r32197461\r\n\r\nThe benchmark result should be same with `UTF8String`, can be found in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19180 (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19180#issuecomment-329467838)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n- Move test from `TypeUtilsSuite` to `ByteArraySuite`\r\n- Benchmark result\r\n\r\n[JDK8](https://github.com/ulysses-you/spark/actions/runs/1377336453):\r\n```\r\n================================================================================================\r\nbyte

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. Move `DESCRIBE DATABASE/NAMESPACE` parsing tests to `DescribeNamespaceParserSuite`.\r\n2. Put common `DESCRIBE NAMESPACE` tests into one trait `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.command. DescribeNamespaceSuiteBase`, and put datasource specific tests to the `v1.DescribeNamespaceSuite` and `v2.DescribeNamespaceSuite`.\r\n\r\nThe changes follow the approach of #30287.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. The unification will allow to run common `DESCRIBE NAMESPACE` tests for both DSv1/Hive DSv1 and DSv2\r\n2. We can detect missing features and differences between DSv1 and DSv2 implementations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator.fetchHostLocalBlocks method, we generate dirFetchRequests based on externalShuffleServiceEnabled. But in fact, the MapStatus object generated in the shuffle write phase had already generated the BlockManagerId object according to externalShuffleServiceEnabled in the BlockManager.initialize method.\r\n\r\nSo we don't need to judge it again.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n Add a 'kill' executor link in the Web UI,  so it's easier for users to kill executors in the UI.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe executor which is running in a bad node(eg. The system is overloaded or disks are busy) or  has big GC overheads may affect the efficiency of job execution, although there are speculative mechanisms to resolve this problem, but sometimes the speculated task may also run in a bad executor.\r\nWe should have a \"kill\" link for each executor, similar to what we have for each stage, so it's easier for users to kill executors in the UI.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes,  user can  kill executors via the Web UI.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39684231/137618317-752fec71-6db7-4c75-a6f3-7a5644769cec.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes the issue that `scala.Seq[scala.collection.mutable.ArraySeq$ofRef]` will be passed to `ResolvedRFormula.terms` though it expects `scala.Seq[scala.Seq[String]]` with Scala 2.13.\r\nAs of Scala 2.13, `scala.Seq` is `scala.collection.immutable.Seq`, so this issue happens.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBug fix.\r\nDue to this issue, `ResolvedRFormula.toString` throws `ClassCastException`.\r\n```\r\njava.lang.ClassCastException: scala.collection.mutable.ArraySeq$ofRef cannot be cast to scala.collection.immutable.Seq\r\n        at scala.collection.immutable.List.map(List.scala:246)\r\n        at scala.collection.immutable.List.map(List.scala:79)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.ml.feature.ResolvedRFormula.toString(RFormulaParser.scala:143)\r\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\r\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)\r\n        at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\r\n        at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498)\r\n        at py4j.reflection.MethodInvoker.invoke(MethodInvoker.java:244)\r\n        at py4j.reflection.ReflectionEngine.invoke(ReflectionEngine.java:357)\r\n        at py4j.Gateway.invoke(Gateway.java:282)\r\n        at py4j.commands.AbstractCommand.invokeMethod(AbstractCommand.java:132)\r\n        at py4j.commands.CallCommand.execute(CallCommand.java:79)\r\n        at py4j.ClientServerConnection.waitForCommands(ClientServerConnection.java:182)\r\n        at py4j.ClientServerConnection.run(ClientServerConnection.java:106)\r\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew test is added and `build/sbt -Pscala-2.13 \"testOnly org.apache.spark.ml.feature.RFormulaSuite\"` passes.\r\nCIs should ensure that this change works with Scala 2.12 too.","created_at":"2021-10-17T03:20:41Z","updated_at":"2021-10-18T01:03:10Z","closed_at":"2021-10-18T01:03:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7fdb4e95d5b1aa00efafee52f55e93d89fb6ecd3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34301/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34301/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34301/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/76e499e3d6aea13e0dc97536780cbe5bf9d01996","head":{"label":"sarutak:fix-rformula-scala-2.13","ref":"fix-rformula-scala-2.13","sha":"76e499e3d6aea13e0dc97536780cbe5bf9d01996","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

All other columns types are not allowed in MIN/MAX aggregate push down.\r\n* All columns types are supported in COUNT aggregate push down.\r\n* Nested column's sub-fields are disallowed in aggregate push down.\r\n* If the file does not have valid statistics, Spark will throw exception and fail query.\r\n* If aggregate has filter or group-by column, aggregate will not be pushed down.\r\n\r\nAt code level, the PR does:\r\n* `OrcScanBuilder`: `pushAggregation()` checks whether the aggregation can be pushed down. The most checking logic is shared between Parquet and ORC, extracted into `AggregatePushDownUtils.getSchemaForPushedAggregation()`. `OrcScanBuilder` will create a `OrcScan` with aggregation and aggregation data schema.\r\n* `OrcScan`: `createReaderFactory` creates a ORC reader factory with aggregation and schema. Similar change with `ParquetScan`.\r\n* `OrcPartitionReaderFactory`: `buildReaderWithAggregates` creates a ORC reader with aggregate push down (i.e. read ORC file footer to process columns statistics, instead of reading actual data in the file). `buildColumnarReaderWithAggregates` creates a columnar ORC reader similarly. Both delegate the real work to read footer in `OrcUtils.createAggInternalRowFromFooter`.\r\n* `OrcUtils.createAggInternalRowFromFooter`: reads ORC file footer to process columns statistics (real heavy lift happens here). Similar to `ParquetUtils.createAggInternalRowFromFooter`. Leverage utility method such as `OrcFooterReader.readStatistics`.\r\n* `OrcFooterReader`: `readStatistics` reads the ORC `ColumnStatistics[]` into Spark `OrcColumnStatistics`. The transformation is needed here, because ORC `ColumnStatistics[]` stores all columns statistics in a flatten array style, and hard to process. Spark `OrcColumnStatistics` stores the statistics in nested tree structure (e.g. like `StructType`). This is used by `OrcUtils.createAggInternalRowFromFooter`\r\n* `OrcColumnStatistics`: the easy-to-manipulate structure for ORC `ColumnStatistics`. This is used by `OrcFooterReader.readStatistics`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo improve the performance of query with aggregate.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. A user-facing config `spark.sql.orc.aggregatePushdown` is added to control enabling/disabling the aggregate push down for ORC. By default the feature is disabled.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test in `FileSourceAggregatePushDownSuite.scala`. Refactored all unit tests in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33639, and it now works for both Parquet and ORC.","created_at":"2021-10-16T02:49:31Z","updated_at":"2021-10-29T00:38:51Z","closed_at":"2021-10-29T00:29:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f3b450f932a51d34df11b60e32d310267beb3caf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34298/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34298/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34298/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d85d4ba720a0936ee636320be8cfefe9a72565f9","head":{"label":"c21:orc-agg","ref":"orc-agg","sha":"d85d4ba720a0936ee636320be8cfefe9a72565f9","user":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159474643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk0NzQ2NDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"c21/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/c21/spark","description":"Mirror

There are 15 cases like this, all listed below\r\n    ```\r\n    pycodestyle checks failed:\r\n    ./python/pyspark/sql/catalog.py:349:101: E501 line too long (103 > 100 characters)\r\n    ./python/pyspark/sql/session.py:652:101: E501 line too long (106 > 100 characters)\r\n    ./python/pyspark/sql/utils.py:50:101: E501 line too long (108 > 100 characters)\r\n    ./python/pyspark/sql/streaming.py:1063:101: E501 line too long (128 > 100 characters)\r\n    ./python/pyspark/sql/streaming.py:1071:101: E501 line too long (112 > 100 characters)\r\n    ./python/pyspark/sql/streaming.py:1080:101: E501 line too long (124 > 100 characters)\r\n    ./python/pyspark/sql/streaming.py:1259:101: E501 line too long (134 > 100 characters)\r\n    ./python/pyspark/sql/pandas/conversion.py:136:101: E501 line too long (106 > 100 characters)\r\n    ./python/pyspark/ml/param/_shared_params_code_gen.py:111:101: E501 line too long (103 > 100 characters)\r\n    ./python/pyspark/ml/param/_shared_params_code_gen.py:136:101: E501 line too long (105 > 100 characters)\r\n    ./python/pyspark/ml/param/_shared_params_code_gen.py:163:101: E501 line too long (101 > 100 characters)\r\n    ./python/pyspark/ml/param/_shared_params_code_gen.py:233:101: E501 line too long (101 > 100 characters)\r\n    ./python/pyspark/ml/param/_shared_params_code_gen.py:265:101: E501 line too long (101 > 100 characters)\r\n    ./python/pyspark/tests/test_readwrite.py:235:101: E501 line too long (114 > 100 characters)\r\n    ./python/pyspark/tests/test_readwrite.py:336:101: E501 line too long (114 > 100 characters)\r\n    ```\r\n- After reformatting, minor typing changes were made:\r\n   - Realign certain `type: ignore` comments with ignored code.\r\n   -  Apply explicit `casts` to  ` @unittest.skipIf` messages.  The following\r\n      ```python\r\n      @unittest.skipIf(\r\n          not have_pandas or not have_pyarrow, pandas_requirement_message or pyarrow_requirement_message\r\n      )  # type: ignore[arg-type]\r\n      ```\r\n      replaced with\r\n              \r\n      ```python\r\n      @unittest.skipIf(\r\n          not have_pandas or not have_pyarrow, \r\n          cast(str, pandas_requirement_message or pyarrow_requirement_message),\r\n      )\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, type annotations are tested primarily for integrity and, to lesser extent, against actual API. Testing against examples is work in progress (SPARK-36997).  Data tests allow us to improve coverage and test negative cases (code, that should fail type checker validation).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

This is my first time playing around with codegen, so definitely looking for any feedback. I ran into several issues along the way which you'll see in some checks I had to add. Specifically:\r\n- I initially added lambda variable tracking to the codegen context, to make sure a function can't be split out while there is any active lambda variables and using local project values for the lambda variables. But this lead to a function to large issue when testing it in production code so I changed it to just use everything off of the reference to the atomic variable\r\n- Made sure lambda functions themselves can never be considered for subexpression elimination\r\n\r\nQuestions I have:\r\n- Does it make sense to only use the reference to the atomic variable or should I try to add a mutable state or something for less function calls in the happy non-fallback case?\r\n- Any other weird corner cases I'm not thinking of?\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo improve performance of transform operations, letting the children be codegen'd and participate in WholeStageCodegen\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, only performance improvements.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit tests, let me know if there's other codegen-specific unit tests I should

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nInline type hints for python/pyspark/streaming/context.py from Inline type hints for python/pyspark/streaming/context.pyi.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, there is type hint stub files python/pyspark/streaming/context.pyi to show the expected types for functions, but we can also take advantage of static type checking within the functions by inlining the type hints.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThere is a `synchronize` block in `CatalogManager.currentNamespace` function.\r\nThis PR pulls `SessionCatalog.getCurrentDatabase` out from this `synchronize` block to prevent potential deadlock.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn our case, we have implemented an external catalog, and there is a thread that directly calls SessionCatalog.getTempViewOrPermanentTableMetadata and holds the lock of SessionCatalog. It eventually goes into our external catalog, unfortunately, we then call some functions of SparkSession, e.g. sql. When it calls CatalogManager.currentNamespace, it tries to hold the lock of CatalogManager.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, there are some query threads that execute sqls via DataFrame interface.\r\n\r\nThis is how deadlock occurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently spark cannot trigger this deadlock. So we wrote our own test to verify the effectiveness of this change.\r\nIn our external catalog code base, We write a UT to call SessionCatalog.getTempViewOrPermanentTableMetadata in one thread and while calling spark.sql(\"show databases\") in other thread. Without this patch, a deadlock occurs and timeout exception was thrown. With this patch, UT works correctly.\r\nWe also tested this patch on the client's production environment, and the deadlock is fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-15T07:48:25Z","updated_at":"2021-10-23T01:23:58Z","closed_at":"2021-10-19T06:48:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"63e4ad67c0f2b17dbb40aaea62372c63654aedef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34292/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34292/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34292/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a2deb7c06fec9be5867500a4108b8452c2651f14","head":{"label":"chenzhx:bug-fix","ref":"bug-fix","sha":"a2deb7c06fec9be5867500a4108b8452c2651f14","user":{"login":"chenzhx","id":18550937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTUwOTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18550937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzhx","html_url":"https://github.com/chenzhx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzhx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzhx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzhx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzhx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzhx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzhx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzhx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzhx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzhx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":305285107,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDUyODUxMDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"chenzhx/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chenzhx","id":18550937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTUwOTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18550937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzhx","html_url":"https://github.com/chenzhx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzhx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzhx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzhx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzhx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzhx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzhx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzhx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzhx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenzhx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chenzhx/spark","description":"customized

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPush down limit to data source for better performance\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor LIMIT, e.g. `SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 10`, Spark retrieves all the data from table and then returns 10 rows. If we can push LIMIT to data source side, the data transferred to Spark will be dramatically reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. new interface `SupportsPushDownLimit`\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR reverts https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32429 and disables pinned thread mode by default.\r\nAlthough I made a fix in Py4J at https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/pull/440, we might have to disable it to be more conservative.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I am still investigating if we will keep it enabled or disabled therefore I mark it as WIP for now.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo prevent regressions in notebooks such as Jupyter, see also SPARK-37004.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`UseCompressedOops` Option has some different behaviors between Java 8, Java 11 and Java 17, if we execute command \r\n\r\n```\r\njava -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -XX:-UseCompressedOops -version | grep Compressed\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result of Java 8 is\r\n\r\n```\r\nbool UseCompressedClassPointers                = false

`-XX:-UseCompressedClassPointers` are no longer  react in chain when use Java 17, if we execute\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn clean install -pl sql/core -am -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.sql.execution.WholeStageCodegenSparkSubmitSuite  \r\n```\r\n\r\nwith Java 17, the test failed due to `Exception in thread \"main\" org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: 16 was not greater than 16`, so the change of this pr is  replace `UseCompressedOops` with `UseCompressedClassPointers` to pass `WholeStageCodegenSparkSubmitSuite` with Java 17 .\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPass UT with JDK 17\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSwitch (or upgrade) the [irmen/pyrolite.pickle](https://github.com/irmen/Pyrolite/tree/master) v4.30 to [irmen/pickle](https://github.com/irmen/pickle) v1.2 in this patch\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Spark was using `Pyrolite.pickle` (v4.30) to pickle Java objects to python objects, but there was [a problem when pickling decimal(NaN)](https://github.com/irmen/pickle/issues/7) .\r\n- irmen/Pyrolite pickle is splited as separate [irmen/pickle](https://github.com/irmen/pickle) library after Pyrolite v5, the bugfix would not be backported to v4.x, that means we have to switch pyrolite to pickle.\r\n- The double NaN pickled issue solved in https://github.com/irmen/pickle/issues/7 in [irmen/pickle](https://github.com/irmen/pickle) v1.2\r\n\r\nSo, We switch (or upgrade) the pyrolite.pickle to pickle in this patch.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n To gracefully handle the error thrown when we try to make room for parsing of different applications and they try to evict the same application by deleting the directory path.\r\n\r\nAlso, added a test for `deleteStore` in `HistoryServerDiskManagerSuite`\r\n\r\n ### Why are the changes needed?\r\n Otherwise, an NoSuchFileException is thrown when it cannot find the directory path to exist.\r\n\r\n ### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n no\r\n\r\n ### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a unit test for `deleteStore` but not specifically testing the concurrency fix.","created_at":"2021-10-13T17:55:50Z","updated_at":"2021-11-09T14:09:31Z","closed_at":"2021-11-06T00:32:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3b484fd169b746572b65deb63eb9928bd8a13a75","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34276/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34276/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34276/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/eb95be86299b427cbbef22f3d294266769ceda70","head":{"label":"thejdeep:SPARK-36998","ref":"SPARK-36998","sha":"eb95be86299b427cbbef22f3d294266769ceda70","user":{"login":"thejdeep","id":1708757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDg3NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1708757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep","html_url":"https://github.com/thejdeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":302781737,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDI3ODE3Mzc=","name":"spark","full_name":"thejdeep/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"thejdeep","id":1708757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDg3NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1708757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep","html_url":"https://github.com/thejdeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/thejdeep/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently we use FileCommitProtocol for all insert job, but for SQL part, we should support more strategy such as writing data to stagingdir then remove to target path, with such commit protocol will support more case of DataSource Insert.\r\n\r\nI have plan 4 step to do:\r\n   1. Add SQLFileCommitProtocol inherit from FileCommitProtocol and use this in all SQL module to replace FileCommitProtocol. And in this protocol we add two necessary API `getOutputPath` & `getWorkPath` like `PathOutputCommitter`, Add SQL related logic to SQLHadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol and make it inherit from SQLCOmmitProtocol\r\n   3. Make dynamic partition insert 's stagingdir can be customized by user.\r\n   4. Add new commit protocol that support writing data to stagingdir then move to target path\r\n \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake SQL's file commit logic code refactored and support more function\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser's self defined commit protocol for SQL may need to change to inherit from SQLFileCommitProtocol\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR is to disable two level of maps for final hash aggregation by default. The feature was introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32242 and we found it can lead to query performance regression when the final aggregation gets rows with a lot of distinct keys. The 1st level hash map is full so a lot of rows will waste the 1st hash map lookup and inserted into 2nd hash map. This feature still benefits query with not so many distinct keys though, so introducing a config here `spark.sql.codegen.aggregate.final.map.twolevel.enabled`, to allow query to enable the feature when seeing benefit.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix query regression.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the introduced `spark.sql.codegen.aggregate.final.map.twolevel.enabled` config.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting unit test in `AggregationQuerySuite.scala`.\r\n\r\nAlso verified generated code for an example query in the file:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n      |SELECT key, avg(value)\r\n      |FROM agg1\r\n      |GROUP BY key\r\n    \"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n```\r\n\r\nVerified the generated code for final hash aggregation not have two level maps by default: \r\nhttps://gist.github.com/c21/d4ce87ef28a22d1ce839e0cda000ce14 .\r\n\r\nVerified the generated code for final hash aggregation have two level

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nUnify the getPrefix function of `UTF8String` and `ByteArray`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen execute sort operator, we first compare the prefix. However the getPrefix function of byte array is slow. We use first 8 bytes as the prefix, so at most we will call 8 times with `Platform.getByte` which is slower than call once with `Platform.getInt` or `Platform.getLong`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a longstanding issue where the `DAGScheduler'`s single-threaded event processing loop could become blocked by slow `RDD.getPartitions()` calls, preventing other events (like task completions and concurrent job submissions) from being processed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nWith this patch's change, Spark will now call `.partitions` on every RDD in the DAG before submitting a job to the scheduler, ensuring that the expensive `getPartitions()` calls occur outside of the scheduler event loop.\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\n\r\nThe `RDD.partitions` method lazily computes an RDD's partitions by calling `RDD.getPartitions()`. The `getPartitions()` method is invoked only once per RDD and its result is cached in the `RDD.partitions_` private field. Sometimes the `getPartitions()` call can be expensive: for example, `HadoopRDD.getPartitions()` performs file listing operations. \r\n\r\nThe `.partitions` method is invoked at many different places in Spark's code, including many existing call sites that are outside of the scheduler event loop. As a result, it's _often_ the case that an RDD's partitions will have been computed before the RDD is submitted to the DAGScheduler. For example, [`submitJob` calls `rdd.partitions.length`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3ba57f5edc5594ee676249cd309b8f0d8248462e/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/DAGScheduler.scala#L837), so the DAG root's partitions will be computed outside of the scheduler event loop.\r\n\r\nHowever, there's still some cases where `partitions` gets evaluated for the first time inside of the `DAGScheduler` internals. For example, [`ShuffledRDD.getPartitions`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3ba57f5edc5594ee676249cd309b8f0d8248462e/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/ShuffledRDD.scala#L92-L94) doesn't call `.partitions` on the RDD being shuffled, so a plan with a ShuffledRDD at the root won't necessarily result in `.partitions` having been called on all RDDs prior to scheduler job submission.\r\n\r\n#### Correctness: proving that we make no excess `.partitions` calls \r\n\r\nThis PR adds code to traverse the DAG prior to job submission and call `.partitions` on every RDD encountered. \r\n\r\nI'd like to argue that this results in no _excess_ `.partitions` calls: in every case where the new code calls `.partitions` there is existing code which would have called `.partitions` at some point during a successful job execution:\r\n\r\n- Assume that this is the first time we are computing every RDD in the DAG.\r\n- Every RDD appears in some stage.\r\n- [`submitStage` will call `submitMissingTasks`](https://github.com/databricks/runtime/blob/1e83dfe4f685bad7f260621e77282b1b4cf9bca4/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/DAGScheduler.scala#L1438) on every stage root RDD.\r\n- [`submitStage` calls `getPreferredLocsInternal`](https://github.com/databricks/runtime/blob/1e83dfe4f685bad7f260621e77282b1b4cf9bca4/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/DAGScheduler.scala#L1687-L1696) on every stage root RDD.\r\n- [`getPreferredLocsInternal`](https://github.com/databricks/runtime/blob/1e83dfe4f685bad7f260621e77282b1b4cf9bca4/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/DAGScheduler.scala#L2995-L3043) visits the RDD and all of its parents RDDs that are computed in the same stage (via narrow dependencies) and calls `.partitions` on each RDD visited.\r\n- Therefore `.partitions` is invoked on every RDD in the DAG by the time the job has successfully completed.\r\n- Therefore this patch's change does not introduce any new calls to `.partitions` which would not have otherwise occurred (assuming the job succeeded).\r\n\r\n#### Ordering of `.partitions` calls\r\n\r\nI don't think the order in which `.partitions` calls occur matters for correctness: the DAGScheduler happens to invoke `.partitions` in a particular order today (defined by the DAG traversal order in internal scheduler methods), but there's many  lots of out-of-order `.partition` calls occurring elsewhere in the codebase.\r\n\r\n#### Handling of exceptions in `.partitions`\r\n\r\nI've chosen **not** to add special error-handling for the new `.partitions` calls: if exceptions occur then they'll bubble up, unwrapped, to the user code submitting the Spark job.\r\n\r\nIt's sometimes important to preserve exception wrapping behavior, but I don't think that concern is warranted in this particular case: whether `getPartitions` occurred inside or outside of the scheduler (impacting whether exceptions manifest in wrapped or unwrapped form, and impacting whether failed jobs appear in the Spark UI) was not crisply defined (and in some rare cases could even be [influenced by Spark settings in non-obvious ways](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/10d5303174bf4a47508f6227bbdb1eaf4c92fcdb/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/Partitioner.scala#L75-L79)), so I think it's both unlikely that users were relying on the old behavior and very difficult to preserve it.\r\n\r\n#### Should this have a configuration flag?\r\n\r\nPer discussion from a previous PR trying to solve this problem (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24438#pullrequestreview-232692586), I've decided to skip adding a configuration flag for this.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis fixes a longstanding scheduler performance problem which has been reported by multiple users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI added a regression test in `BasicSchedulerIntegrationSuite` to cover the regular job submission codepath (`DAGScheduler.submitJob`)This test uses CountDownLatches to simulate the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd the ability to selectively disable watching or polling\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWatching or polling for pod status on Kubernetes can place additional load on etcd, with a large number of executors and large number of jobs this can have negative impacts and executors register themselves with the driver under normal operations anyways.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nTwo new config flags.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests + manually tested a forked version of this on an internal cluster with both watching and polling disabled.","created_at":"2021-10-12T19:17:23Z","updated_at":"2022-03-13T00:15:50Z","closed_at":"2022-03-13T00:15:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3281ea9a8df7c9e55d5d5f699c1c44d3ad1bb896","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34264/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34264/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34264/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/65d7cc7ffe7513c84f1a66e118cf23d747ad1805","head":{"label":"holdenk:SPARK-36462-allow-spark-on-kube-to-operate-without-watchers","ref":"SPARK-36462-allow-spark-on-kube-to-operate-without-watchers","sha":"65d7cc7ffe7513c84f1a66e118cf23d747ad1805","user":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17235154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNTE1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"holdenk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe PR modifies `IsNotNull` constraint generation to generate constraints on the referenced nested field instead of generating a constraint on the top level nested type. See the following section for an example.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n[InferFiltersFromConstraints](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/05c0fa573881b49d8ead9a5e16071190e5841e1b/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/optimizer/Optimizer.scala#L1206) optimization rule generates `IsNotNull` constraints corresponding to null intolerant predicates. The `IsNotNull` constraints are generated on the attribute inside the corresponding predicate.\r\ne.g. A predicate `a > 0` on an integer column a will result in a constraint `IsNotNull(a)`. On the other hand a predicate on a nested int column `structCol.b` where `structCol` is a struct column results in a constraint `IsNotNull(structCol)`.\r\n\r\nThis generation of constraints on the root level nested type is extremely conservative as it could lead to materialization of the the entire struct. The constraint should instead be generated on the nested field being referenced by the predicate. In the above example, the constraint should be `IsNotNull(structCol.b)` instead of `IsNotNull(structCol)`. \r\n\r\nThe new constraints also create opportunities for nested pruning. Currently `IsNotNull(structCol)` constraint would preclude pruning of `structCol`. However the constraint `IsNotNull(structCol.b)` could create opportunities to prune `structCol`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test to `InferFiltersFromConstraintsSuite`.","created_at":"2021-10-12T18:02:42Z","updated_at":"2021-10-18T09:42:02Z","closed_at":"2021-10-18T09:42:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b58a818b642df47c6b1f8da3051a616ab27813dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34263/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34263/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34263/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ae35b1282e5b0b2ac05255720b5b00f929b8f352","head":{"label":"utkarsh39:infer-nested-constraints","ref":"infer-nested-constraints","sha":"ae35b1282e5b0b2ac05255720b5b00f929b8f352","user":{"login":"utkarsh39","id":10495099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk1MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10495099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39","html_url":"https://github.com/utkarsh39","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311491719,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTE0OTE3MTk=","name":"spark","full_name":"utkarsh39/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"utkarsh39","id":10495099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk1MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10495099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39","html_url":"https://github.com/utkarsh39","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsh39/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/utkarsh39/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to check column types of tables that use `Hive` as the **provider**, and disallow tables with ANSI intervals. Currently, Hive Metastore & SerDe don't support creating tables with interval types. So, even Spark converts Catalyst's ANSI interval types to Hive's types:\r\n- `YearMonthIntervalType` -> [INTERVAL_YEAR_MONTH](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/7b3ecf617a6d46f48a3b6f77e0339fd4ad95a420/serde/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/serde2/thrift/Type.java#L78-L80)\r\n- `DayTimeIntervalType` -> [INTERVAL_DAY_TIME](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/7b3ecf617a6d46f48a3b6f77e0339fd4ad95a420/serde/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/serde2/thrift/Type.java#L81-L83)\r\n\r\nHive Metastore fails with the error (for parquet SerDe):\r\n```java\r\nCaused by: java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Unknown field type: interval_year_month\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.serde.ArrayWritableObjectInspector.getObjectInspector(ArrayWritableObjectInspector.java:141)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.serde.ArrayWritableObjectInspector.<init>(ArrayWritableObjectInspector.java:86)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.serde.ArrayWritableObjectInspector.<init>(ArrayWritableObjectInspector.java:59)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.serde.ParquetHiveSerDe.initialize(ParquetHiveSerDe.java:129)\r\n```\r\nat https://github.com/apache/hive/blame/master/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/parquet/serde/ArrayWritableObjectInspector.java#L94 .\r\n\r\nAfter the changes, Spark will verify column types before sending unnecessary requests to Hive Metastore.\r\n\r\nI more details, I added new check to the existing function `DDLUtils.checkDataColNames()`, and renamed the function to `checkTableColumns()` because it checks table column names together with column types.\r\n\r\n**Note:** We still allow tables of non-Hive provider with ANSI intervals using Hive external catalog, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34215.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make the error message more clear and independent from Hive Metastore.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. This PR changes the error message.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```SQL\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE TBL STORED AS PARQUET AS SELECT INTERVAL '1-1' YEAR TO MONTH AS YM;\r\nError in query: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Error: type expected at the position 0 of 'interval year to month' but 'interval year to month' is found.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```SQL\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE TBL STORED AS PARQUET AS SELECT INTERVAL '1-1' YEAR TO MONTH AS YM;\r\n21/10/12 16:51:14 ERROR SparkSQLDriver: Failed in [CREATE TABLE TBL STORED AS PARQUET AS SELECT INTERVAL '1-1' YEAR TO MONTH AS YM]\r\njava.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Hive table `default`.`TBL` with ANSI intervals is not supported\r\n\tat

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to use V2 commands as default as outlined in [SPARK-36588](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36588), and this PR migrates `SHOW NAMESPACES` to use v2 command by default. (Technically speaking, there is no v1 command for `SHOW NAMESPACES/DATABASES`, but this PR removes an extra check in `ResolveSessionCatalog` to handle session catalog.)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's been a while since we introduced the v2 commands,  and it seems reasonable to use v2 commands by default even for the session catalog, with a legacy config to fall back to the v1 commands.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, the user can use v1 command by setting `spark.sql.legacy.useV1Command` to `true`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit tests.","created_at":"2021-10-12T06:33:28Z","updated_at":"2021-10-14T02:34:27Z","closed_at":"2021-10-13T19:13:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"12af68120753d67c1078f007a251172c678c3bd1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34255/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34255/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34255/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/de4dc665d2c6c14a4c14ed6d5f6fa3ecd42c1dfe","head":{"label":"imback82:migrate_show_namespaces","ref":"migrate_show_namespaces","sha":"de4dc665d2c6c14a4c14ed6d5f6fa3ecd42c1dfe","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen a hive view is created without explicit column names, spark couldn't read it correctly. For example:\r\n```\r\n-- use hive to create the view\r\nCREATE VIEW test_view AS SELECT 1 FROM t\r\n-- use spark to read the view\r\nSELECT * FROM test_view\r\n```\r\nWe will get an exception about: `cannot resolve '_c0' given input columns: [1]`\r\nThe problematic plan is:\r\n```\r\n'Project [upcast('_c0, IntegerType) AS _c0#3]\r\n +- Project [1 AS 1#4]\r\n    +- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.some_table\r\n       +- Relation default.some_table[id#1L] orc\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR handles the views created by Hive separately to fix this issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nbugfix\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, this is a regression.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nnewly added

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a re-proposal of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34034. Ignore duplicated join keys when building hash relation for LEFT SEMI / LEFT ANTI shuffled hash join. The original PR was also covering broadcast hash join, and caused regression for broadcast shuffle exchange reuse in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34034#issuecomment-939862907 . So here we do not covert broadcast hash join. Shuffled hash join do not have the shuffle reuse problem.\r\n\r\nMake the deduplication work with broadcast exchange is kind of non-trivial for me now, because:\r\n\r\nFor two `BroadcastExchangeExec`, one with `ignoreDuplicatedKey` being true (called `exchange_A`), and the other with `ignoreDuplicatedKey` being false (called `exchange_B`):\r\n\r\n* If we decide these two `BroadcastExchangeExec`s are not equal, then we have regression that we reuse fewer exchange after the change, as https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34034#issuecomment-939862907 .\r\n* If we decide these two `BroadcastExchangeExec`s are equal, then we might have correctness issue when `exchange_B` reuses result of `exchange_A`. Also these two `BroadcastExchangeExec`s should not be equal as they already have different results in underlying hash relations.\r\n\r\nI still see it's valuable to have the optimization for shuffled hash join only. So leave the optimization for broadcast hash join as a followup as it needs more thoughts.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nHelp reduce the hash table size of join for LEFT SEMI and LEFT ANTI, reduce OOM possibility of shuffled hash join.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test in
