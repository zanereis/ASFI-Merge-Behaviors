described in KAFKA-9181, kafka.api.SaslGssapiSslEndToEndAuthorizationTest.testNoConsumeWithoutDescribeAclViaSubscribe occasionally hits unexpected TopicAuthorizationException even after the topic is removed from the subscription. The test uses small metadata refresh time and hence can see metadata responses before JoinGroup is processed. We currently rely on `onJoinPrepare` to reset SubscriptionState.groupSubscription, which accumulates topics until reset. If we process JoinGroup after a subscribe without a new `onJoinPrepare`, we leave the topic in `SubscriptionState.groupSubscription` and hence in metadata. This PR resets `groupSubscription` when sending JoinGroup request, when `ConsumerCoordinator.joinedSubscription` is updated.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

PR avoids a performance issue with `DeleteRecords` when a partition directory contains high numbers of files. Previously, `DeleteRecords` would iterate the partition directory searching for producer state snapshot files. With this change, the iteration is removed in favor of keeping a 1:1 mapping between producer state snapshot file and segment file. A segment files corresponding producer state snapshot file is now deleted when the segment file is deleted. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

ticket shall improve two aspects of the retrieval of sensors:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9152\r\n\r\n1. Currently, when a sensor is retrieved with *Metrics.*Sensor() (e.g. ThreadMetrics.createTaskSensor()) after it was created with the same method *Metrics.*Sensor(), the sensor is added again to the corresponding queue in *Sensors (e.g. threadLevelSensors) in StreamsMetricsImpl. Those queues are used to remove the sensors when removeAll*LevelSensors() is called. Having multiple times the same sensors in this queue is not an issue from a correctness point of view. However, it would reduce the footprint to only store a sensor once in those queues.\r\n\r\n2. When a sensor is retrieved, the current code attempts to create a new sensor and to add to it again the corresponding metrics. This could be avoided.\r\n\r\nBoth aspects could be improved by checking whether a sensor already exists by calling getSensor() on the Metrics object and checking the return value.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-10T16:13:44Z","updated_at":"2020-01-24T21:56:27Z","closed_at":"2020-01-24T21:55:51Z","merged_at":"2020-01-24T21:55:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"2e351e06b3557ed63a54946f33fd1c0f0f136b50","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7928/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7928/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/7928/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/e55a741929fa33f80b0a4bfe2bbc34942be8bb84","head":{"label":"highluck:improve-sensor-re","ref":"improve-sensor-re","sha":"e55a741929fa33f80b0a4bfe2bbc34942be8bb84","user":{"login":"highluck","id":18625344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI1MzQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18625344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/highluck","html_url":"https://github.com/highluck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highluck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highluck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highluck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highluck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highluck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highluck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highluck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highluck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highluck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":178672036,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzg2NzIwMzY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"highluck/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"highluck","id":18625344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI1MzQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18625344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/highluck","html_url":"https://github.com/highluck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highluck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highluck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highluck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highluck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highluck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highluck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highluck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highluck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highluck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/highluck/kafka","description":"Mirror

is another round in my effort to clean up some of the integration tests and improve build time. This patch improves the authorizer integration tests in the following ways:\r\n\r\n1. We use a separate principal for inter-broker communications. This ensures that ACLs set in the test cases do not interfere with inter-broker communication. We had two test cases (`testCreateTopicAuthorizationWithClusterCreate` and `testAuthorizationWithTopicExisting`) which depend on topic creation and were timing out because of inter-broker metadata propagation failures. The timeouts were treated as successfully satisfying the expectation of authorization. So the tests passed, but not because of the intended reason.\r\n2. Previously `GroupAuthorizerIntegrationTest` was inheriting _all_ of the tests from `AuthorizerIntegrationTest`. This seemed like overkill since the ACL evaluation logic is essentially the same. \r\n\r\nTotally this should take about 5-10 minutes off the total build time and make the authorizer integration tests a little more resilient to problems with inter-broker communication.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

the build failures in the JIRA, it looks like the test occasionally hits request timeout when running from Jenkins (I was able to recreate only with much smaller request timeouts). Since the test blocks requests threads while sending the ACL update requests, updated the test to tolerate timeouts and retry the request for that case. Added an additional check to verify that the requests threads are unblocked when the semaphore is released, ensuring that the timeout is not due to blocked threads.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

PR fixes the regression introduced in 2.4 from 2 refactoring PRs:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/7249/\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/7419/\r\n\r\nThe bug was introduced by having a logical path leading `numPartitionsCandidate` to be 0, which is assigned to `numPartitions` and later being checked by `setNumPartitions`. In the subsequent check we will throw illegal argument if the `numPartitions` is 0.\r\n\r\nThis bug is both impacting new 2.4 application and upgrades to 2.4 in certain types of topology. The example in original JIRA was imported as a new integration test to guard against such regression. We also verify that without the bug fix application will still fail by running this integration test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

enabled lazy mmap on index files by initializing indices on-demand rather than performing costly disk/memory operations when creating all indices on broker startup. This helped reducing the startup time of brokers. However, segment indices are still created on closing segments, regardless of whether they need to be closed or not.\r\n\r\nThis patch:\r\n* Improves shutdown performance via lazy accessing the offset and time indices.\r\n* Eliminates redundant disk accesses and memory mapped operations while deleting or renaming files that back segment indices.\r\n* Prevents illegal accesses to underlying indices of a closed segment, which would lead to memory leaks due to recreation of the underlying memory mapped objects.\r\n\r\nIn our evaluations in a cluster with 31 brokers, where each broker has 13K to 20K segments, we observed up to 2 orders of magnitude faster LogManager shutdown times with this patch -- i.e. dropping the LogManager shutdown time of each broker from 10s of seconds to 100s of milliseconds.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

PR changes log4j dependency into log4j2.\r\n\r\nlog4j migrated into log4j2 after its last release of 1.2.17 (May 2012), which is affected by this problem. So, the only way to fix it is by moving log4j dependency into log4j2.\r\n\r\nThe problem is: the API for setting log level dynamically is different between log4j and log4j2. So, this PR also updates how `Log4jController` works.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes a potential problem in `Log4jController#getLogLevel` - what if the root logger's level is null? It may result in `NullPointerException`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n-

be able to correctly fence zombie producer txn commit, we propose to add (member.id, group.instance.id, generation) into the transaction commit protocol to raise the same level of correctness guarantee as consumer commit.\r\n\r\nMajor changes involve:\r\n\r\n1. Upgrade transaction commit protocol with  (member.id, group.instance.id, generation). The client will fail if the broker is not supporting the new protocol.\r\n2. Refactor group coordinator logic to handle new txn commit errors such as FENCED_INSTANCE_ID, UNKNOWN_MEMBER_ID and ILLEGAL_GENERATION. We loose the check on transaction commit when the member.id is set to empty. This is because the member.id check is an add-on safety for producer commit, and we also need to consider backward compatibility for old producer clients without member.id information. And if producer equips with group.instance.id, then it must provide a valid member.id (not empty definitely), the same as a consumer commit.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

when mirrormaker replicates a group of topics, the assignment between topic-partition and tasks are pretty static. E.g. partitions from the same topic tend to be grouped together as much as possible on the same task. For example, 3 tasks to mirror 3 topics with 8, 2 and 2\r\npartitions respectively. 't1' denotes 'task 1', 't0p5' denotes 'topic 0, partition 5'\r\n\r\nThe original assignment will look like:\r\n\r\nt1 -> [t0p0, t0p1, t0p2, t0p3]\r\nt2 -> [t0p4, t0p5, t0p6, t0p7]\r\nt3 -> [t1p0, t1p2, t2p0, t2p1]\r\n\r\nThe potential issue of above assignment is: if topic 0 has more traffic than other topics (topic 1, topic 2), t1 and t2 will be loaded more traffic than t3. When the tasks are mapped to the mirrormaker instances (workers) and launched, it will create unbalanced load on the workers. Please see the picture below as an unbalanced example of 2 mirrormaker instances:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"783\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-12-19 at 12 16 02 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32080381/71635359-b6eae880-2bd8-11ea-8ada-29f02ac96c4a.png\">\r\n\r\nGiven each mirrored topic has different traffic and number of partitions, to balance the load\r\nacross all mirrormaker instances (workers), 'roundrobin' helps to evenly assign all\r\ntopic-partition to the tasks, then the tasks are further distributed to workers by calling\r\n'ConnectorUtils.groupPartitions()'. For example, 3 tasks to mirror 3 topics with 8, 2 and 2\r\npartitions respectively. 't1' denotes 'task 1', 't0p5' denotes 'topic 0, partition 5'\r\nt1 -> [t0p0, t0p3, t0p6, t1p1]\r\nt2 -> [t0p1, t0p4, t0p7, t2p0]\r\nt3 -> [t0p2, t0p5, t1p0, t2p1]\r\n\r\nThe improvement of this new above assignment over the original assignment is: the partitions of topic 0, topic 1 and topic 2 are all spread over all tasks, which creates a relatively even load on all workers, after the tasks are mapped to the workers and launched.\r\nPlease see the picture below as a balanced example of 4 mirrormaker instances:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"780\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-12-19 at 8 22 17 AM\"

commit adds the logic to wait for `splitted` batches to be processed after a Message Too Large Exception has been received.\r\nAlso, add a new test class to cover `IncompleteBatches` class.\r\n\r\nThis code adds a new constructor to the classes `ProducerBatch` and `RecordAccumulator` visible to the package, this decouples the dependency between `ProduceRequestResult` and `IncompleteBatches` respectively and allow to test the method `RecordAccumulator#awaitFlushCompletion()`\r\n\r\nThe [Jira ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9312) provides a [test here](https://github.com/lbradstreet/kafka/commit/733a683273c31823df354d0a785cb2c24365735a#diff-0b8da0c7ceecaa1f00486dadb53208b1R2339) that prove the error without these changes.\r\nThis PR does not include that specific test since it involves sleeping the thread and could lead to indeterminate

misoperated my git and need to reopen a PR(the original one is #7761).\r\n\r\nthe `GroupCoordinator` will renew HeartbeatExpiration after receiving `CommitOffsetReq`, so `ConsumerCoordinator` can also renew Heartbeat after sending `CommitOffsetReq`. \r\nHowever, the `ConsumerCoordinator` depends on heartbeats to detect `PreparingRebalance` and rejoin but the `commitOffsetReq` will generally not return an `Errors.ReblanceInProgress`  when `PreparingRebalance`.\r\nSo we just add a `ReblanceInProgress` field to the `CommitOffsetResponse` to indicate whether the `GroupCoordinator` is `PreparingRebalance`.\r\n\r\nbelow is my implementation steps:\r\n1. bump the protocol version of `CommitOffsetReq` and `CommitOffsetResp` and add a field to `ReblanceInProgress` field to the `CommitOffsetResp`.\r\n2. add parameter to `GroupCoordinator.doCommitOffsets` to identify whether should we respond `ReblanceInProgress`;\r\n3. when in `PreparingRebalance`, `GroupCoordinator` just act as before but add a `ReblanceInProgress` to the response;\r\n4. client will interpret it intelligently.\r\n\r\nand the interaction is as follows:\r\n1. if an OLD client commits offset, it just acts as previous, and the broker will also act as previous;\r\n2. if a new client commits offset, it will update heartbeat, the broker may respond a  `ReblanceInProgress`, the client also has the logic to handle it.\r\n\r\nIf this works well, we can also add `update Heartbeat logic` to `FetchOffsetReq` and `TxnOffsetCommitReq`\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n-

are needed for Scala 2.12 too.\r\n* Deprecate `org.apache.kafka.streams.scala.kstream.Suppressed`\r\nand use `org.apache.kafka.streams.kstream.Suppressed` instead.\r\n* Use `Admin.create` instead of `AdminClient.create`.

change adds pylint as a dependency for the ducktape test as well adding a ducktape test that runs pylint. The rationale is that not every environment that runs our build will have pylint installed, but it's easy to add as a python dependency for the ducktape tests.\r\n\r\nIf desired for local development, pylint can be installed as a system package (apt, brew, etc) or installed with pip into a virtualenv. To run pylint on our tests, simply run:\r\n\r\n    pylint -E kafkatest\r\n\r\ninside our \"tests\" directory. This will check for pylint errors in the kafkatest module. Run without the `-E` to see all the warnings.\r\n\r\nThe ducktape tests added here will fail an assertion if any pylint errors are present.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes all the pylint errors that were present.","created_at":"2019-12-20T20:16:31Z","updated_at":"2024-12-23T03:38:20Z","closed_at":"2024-12-23T03:38:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

Extract producer from StreamTask to the RecordCollector; make the task agnostic of the underlying embedded client and instead let RecordCollector handle clients and also interpret their thrown exception (AbstractTask still has a reference of the consumer in order to pause / resume partition, and also get committed offsets; the latter function may be moved into RecordCollector in a later PR).\r\n\r\n1.a Producer.send() could throw KafkaException whose cause is ProducerFenced;\r\n1.b. Producer.send() could return other exceptions as passed from the callback (ProducerFenced and UnknownProducerId);\r\n1.c. Consumer.commit() could throw CommitFailedException;\r\n1.d Producer.[otherAPI] and Consumer.[otherAPI] could throw other KafkaException, including TimeoutException.\r\n\r\n1.a/b/c are interpreted as TaskMigratedException and rethrown from RecordCollector; 1.d are interpreted as general StreamsException and rethrown from RecordCollector.\r\n\r\nTask would not handle any such exception, all of them thrown all the way up to the StreamThread; thread handles TaskMigratedException by closing the task \"uncleanly\", and then handles any other StreamsException as fatal and shutdown itself --- this is a major change in exception handling, e.g. today when close(clean) we try to immediately capture the exception within task, and then immediately handle by re-try close(unclean), which causes very messy hierarchy. **This is not completely done in this PR but we are going to that direction in future PRs.**\r\n\r\n2. ProcessorStateManager and RecordCollector are created before StreamTask / StandbyTask and are passed in as parameters; this also have a good effect in unit tests that we can use nice mocks for them when only testing task functionalities. Also because of this I've removed a bunch of unit tests from the task level (so do not be afraid of the LOC size, the non-testing part is actually not huge), and will move them to state-manager / record-collector after we've done the whole cleanup. During this period the test coverage would be dropped a bit but we will eventually add them back to other classes.\r\n\r\n3. Task close / suspend procedure are cleaned up based on the `clean` flag (the `isZombie` flag is now consolidated into the previous one). Also as a side-effect we fixed the issue that double checkpointing in committing / closing. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

commit, just a working system test for now, no docs.\r\n\r\nI discovered that mutual authentication is required, so client needs\r\na key store in addition to a trust store.  Also, client key store\r\npassword must be the same as any password associated with the key in\r\nthat key store -- if the passwords don't match (or if the key store is\r\nnot specified at all) then the client wil be unable to connect to\r\nZookeeper on the TLS clientSecurePort.\r\n\r\nSpecifying the required parameters (e.g. key/trust store locations and\r\npassword, etc.) currently must be done via Java system properties, and\r\nit is possible to define system properties via \"-D\" flags at the command\r\nline.  This is less than desireable because command line arguments are\r\ninsecure.  A better approach would be to specify them in a .properties\r\nfile and have the JVM read them from there.  This might be doable by\r\nalowing the bin/kafka-run-class.sh script to accept a pair of parameters\r\n(e.g. -sysprops /path/to/system.properties) and invoke a wrapper class\r\nwhen loading system properties from a file is requested; the wrapper\r\nclass could read and apply the system property definitions before\r\nforwarding the invocation to the intended class.  Adding actual Kafka\r\nconfigs is another option, but I think that would only apply to the\r\nbrokers -- command line tools (Zookeeper security migration tool, etc.)\r\nwould still need a separate solution.\r\n\r\nIf/how client certificate authentication can work with the Zookeeper\r\nsecurity migration tool (which adds ACLs to lock down znodes) is an\r\nopen question and requires more investigation.  For example, can SASL\r\nauthentication work on top of certificate authentication?  If so then\r\nit is perhaps an acceptable first pass to leave things as they are --\r\nonly support applying Zookeeper ACLs on the SASL identity.  But if not,\r\nor if we wish to support ACLs based on the certificate identity, then\r\nwe have to investigate how this can be done (maybe no change is needed)\r\nand also if we can support adding ACLs multiple certificate identities.\r\nIf we can't support ading ACLs for multiple certificate identities then\r\nwe would be constrained to all brokers authenticating with the same\r\ncertificate.  So there is investigation to be done here.\r\n\r\nKIP 515 was opened to address some of the above issues but it has been\r\ndormant for a while (and the number 515 was actually already taken by\r\nanother KIP); this KIP might need to be revived (with a new KIP
