implements a version of the Redis LRANGE command, which is used for list data types. Associated tests were also added.\r\n\r\nGiven a key, it returns a list of elements in the range (inclusive) for the specified start index and stop index. Both the start and stop indexes are zero based, which starts at the head of the list. Negative indexes start at the tail of the list.\r\n\r\nLINDEX was modified to use a new method created in this commit. The method converts negative indexes to the corresponding positive index.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken: \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

do not review. Do not merge.\r\n\r\nThis branch has some methods to do offline parsing/validation of network packet captures representing Geode's P2P protocol. It has some refactoring of `tcp/Connection` to separate pure parsing logic from imperative logic. That parsing logic is leveraged in `BufferDebugging` to parse protocol headers, sender and receiver handshakes, and `DistributionMessage` payloads. See `BufferDebugging.parseGemFireP2PProtocolMessage()`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken: \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

problem is that servers send incorrect gateway-receiver connection\r\nload to locators within CacheServerLoadMessage. Additionally, locators\r\ndo not refresh gateway-receivers load with the load received in\r\nCacheServerLoadMessage. The only time locator increments\r\ngateway-receiver load is after it receives\r\nClientConnectionRequest{group=__recv_group...} and returns selected\r\nserver in ClientConnectionResponse message. The client sends\r\na ClientConnectionRequest to the one locator from list received \r\nin RemoteLocatorJoinResponse (initial list of locators) or \r\nLocatorListRequest (periodically updated list of locators). \r\nThe received list is always sorted by the host address and port.\r\nThe client will send ClientConnectionRequest following the \r\nsorted list of locators (from first to last) until a successful outcome.\r\nThat means that the same locator (first one in the list)\r\nwill handle all connection requests in normal conditions, and other\r\nlocators will not update their gateway-receivers connection load.\r\n   \r\nThe solution is to track the gateway-receiver acceptor connection count\r\ncorrectly and, based on it, accurately calculate the load\r\nwhen sending CacheServerLoadMessage. Additionally, each locator will\r\nread the load received from CacheServerLoadMessage and update the\r\ngateway-receivers connection load in group __recv__group accordingly\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken: \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

support for customizing source set paths of ClassAnalysisRule.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM\r\n\r\nModules external to Geode must be structured the same as Geode\r\nsource code in order to use ClassAnalysisRule and the\r\nAnalyze*Serializables tests. This is necessary to better facilitate\r\npluggability of modules that need to provide sanctioned serializable\r\nlists.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION\r\n\r\nAdd source set path customization to ClassAnalysisRule, introduce\r\na new layer of Analyze*Serializables test base classes that can be\r\ndirectly extended in order to customize source set paths in\r\nClassAnalysisRule. Also includes improvements to some iterating\r\nof classes during analysis.\r\n\r\n[prereq for backport of GEODE-9980 and GEODE-9758]\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit

This adds a single category (or type) to each command in order to\r\n  identify the type of data structure it applies too. This is initially\r\n  being done in order to allow Geode statistics to be finer grained in\r\n  how the Radish-specific stats are grouped.\r\n- The category is derived from Redis' ACL Categories. In Redis these\r\n  categories also include the command's flags (and possibly additional\r\n  values). This implementation only specifies the category as it relates\r\n  to the command's data type.  For example, in Redis the `GET` command\r\n  has categories `@read`, `@fast` and `@string`. In Geode, the category\r\n  would only be `@string`. This may well change in the future if ACLs\r\n  are implemented.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken: \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

to Gradle 7.4\r\n- Updated gradle wrapper\r\n- Updated usage of an internal TemporaryFileProvider to the correct location for Gradle 7\r\n- Update the `main` -> `mainClass` for the geode assembly to match Gradle 7 syntax\r\n- Move some `compile` scope to `compileOnly` (required for Gradle 7)\r\n- Add explicit `dependsOn` relationship between tasks that have dependencies that Gradle 7 complains about\r\n- Add a `duplicatesStrategy` to the processIntegrationTestResources to avoid Gradle 7 failing on a duplicate resources in shiro.ini (this duplicate _seems_ to come from how the source set is configured)\r\n- Upgrade the RepeatTestExecutor to match the DefaultTestExecutor from Gradle 7.4\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to
