out of #7823)\r\n\r\nThis simplifies something I found confusing while learning how the Java SDK metrics worked: there were many implementations of `MetricResult` laying around, all with *almost* the same semantics (and a fair amount of copy-paste having happened between them).\r\n\r\nI think I've reduced this to a minimal interface here:\r\n- keyed by \"step name\" (`@Nullable`, for pcollection-scoped system metrics; first-class support of these is coming in #7823) and `MetricName` (namespace, name)\r\n- containing an \"attempted\" value and (possibly `null` / \"unsupported\") \"committed\" value\r\n  - `throw`s `UnsupportedOperationException` on attempting to access absent/unsupported \"committed\" value\r\n- buildable from `MetricUpdate`s, including a transient interim step where \"attempted\" but not \"committed\" may be set, for a `MetricResult` that will ultimately contain both.\r\n  - `MetricsContainerStepMap` in particular had [one `MetricResult` implementation](https://github.com/apache/beam/compare/master...ryan-williams:ac?expand=1#diff-7fd541906a9e771c3312b75947e969daL413) (that was already basically redundant with others in the codebase), and [another just like it](https://github.com/apache/beam/compare/master...ryan-williams:ac?expand=1#diff-7fd541906a9e771c3312b75947e969daL460) that acted as an unofficial sort of \"builder\"; both are gone now.\r\n\r\nR: @robertwb, @ajamato \r\n\r\nI'll CC @mxm @tweise as well since I've sent a bunch to Robert/Alex on this topic, and this one doesn't directly involve the new metrics API design\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLang | SDK | Apex | Dataflow |

used for \"user\" metrics (defined by {ptransform,namespace,name}), the latter for \"system\" metrics ({urn,labels})\r\n- user-metrics are also representable in {urn,labels} form, but as of this PR the Java SDK intercepts attempts to create user-metrics that way (in `MonitoringInfoMetricName.create`) and creates a `MetricName` `AutoValue` instance instead, which preserves existing behavior most

out of #7823)\r\n\r\n`MetricResult` previously had `MetricKey`'s fields inlined, possibly due to living in java/core while `MetricKey` is in runners/core. \r\n\r\nHaving callers use a `MetricKey` simplifies call-sites and prepares for expanding Java SDK metrics to support (ptransform- and pcollection-scoped) system metrics in addition to (ptransform-scoped) user metrics, which #7823 implements.\r\n\r\nThis change also moves `MetricKey` and `MetricFiltering` into java/core, which is basically necessary / logical based on the intra-metrics-class dependencies.\r\n\r\nR: @robertwb,

schemas define a limited number of fundamental types, and often users of schemas have slightly different needs for field types. An example is Beam SQL: SQL has many different date/time/timestamp types, while Beam has only the one DATETIME field type. Today SQL stuffs magic strings into the FieldType metadata to identify _which_ type it is really using, which is quite ad hoc.\r\n\r\nLogical types introduce a principled way of doing this. A new LogicalType class can be defined that uses one of the fundamental Beam field types as storage. The user can then add this logical type to their schema, and Beam will use the underlying field type and record the logical type in the field as well. Logical types have globally unique identifiers that are understood by the system, so this provides a much more principled way of storing custom types in schemas.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds LogicalType and converts Avro and Beam SQL over to the new framework. Follow-on PRs will add CoderLogicalType (so any existing Coder can be used as a Schema field) as well as adding logical-type support to POJOs.

determined that the Go Standard Library JSON encoder handles maps deterministically. This PR:\r\n* extends the tests on the default encoder (JSON) to validate deterministic map encoding.\r\n* Re-allows maps as a valid PCollection type.\r\n* Sets Protobuf encoding to be deterministic.\r\n\r\nStill to do for [BEAM-6652] is to extend ptest with a way for users to test registered coders since most of this scaffolding would be common for all coders. The \"default\" JSON coder can't use this directly since it would introduce a beam -> ptest -> beam import cycle.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

change ensures that the core module javadoc:\r\n\r\n    ./gradlew ':beam-sdks-java-core:javadoc'\r\n\r\nno longer produces the string `@literal` anywhere in the produced html. There may still be some instances in other modules.\r\n\r\nMany code examples in the core SDK use `{@literal @}` inside of a `{@code}` block, which does not escape the `@` as expected, but rather produces the text `{@literal @}`.\r\n\r\nThere's unfortunately not any single solution that's elegant in all cases. The SDK already uses a variety of markup styles for code examples, and I expect that to continue to be the case depending on the complexity of the example.\r\n\r\nI've made additional whitespace and typo fixes along with changing how `@literal` is used such that each of these code examples now renders nicely with the current Java 8 build.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is a breaking change.\r\nIn Go, passing a value to an interface method will cause that value to escape to the heap. Changing these to pointers reduces this overhead significantly, since the value will not need to be checked and allocated at each level.\r\n\r\nFullValue is an implementation detail of the GoSDK to be able to handle the event time, windowing, and K,V status of a given PCollection value, since go doesn't have Generics or similar. This means they're everywhere in the execution stack, and used by the ElementProcessor interface in the exec package.\r\nSince FullValue is simply a transport for values between DoFns, they remain in control by the exec package, allowing us to cache their allocation where appropriate, and re-use them.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the ElementProcessor interface to accept *FullValue instead of FullValue, and changes all beam implementations of ElementProcessor to follow suit.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

change encapsulates internal implementation details that most users should not need.\r\n\r\nIn particular: This CL removes needing to wrap values in the exec.FullValue type before encoding them. It also hides the internal coder.Coder abstraction.\r\n\r\nPreviously users needed to do the following to use a beam coder to encode an element of a given type:\r\n\r\n\tvar t reflect.Type // from somewhere\r\n\tcoder := beam.NewCoder(typex.New(t))\r\n\tenc := exec.MakeElementEncoder(beam.UnwrapCoder(coder))\r\n\tvar buf bytes.Buffer\r\n\terr := enc.Encode(exec.FullValue{Elm: value}, &buf)\r\n\t...\r\n\r\n\r\nThis required users to access beam implementation details directly: coder.Coder, the typex package, the exec package & the FullValue type.\r\n\r\nFollowing this PR:\r\n \r\n\tvar t reflect.Type // from somewhere\r\n\tenc := beam.NewElementEncoder(t)\r\n\tvar buf bytes.Buffer\r\n\terr := enc.Encode(value, &buf)\r\n\t...\r\n \r\nwhich doesn't leak such details. Similarly for the Decoders.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the breaking change of removing the beam.UnwrapCoder method. There is an open question of whether users will ever need to encode KVs, or CoGBKs or similar themselves, rather than via the framework, at which point we can revisit this.\r\n\r\nTODO in a later PR: allow users to register coders that implement beam.ElementEncoder and beam.ElementDecoder.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

this is a breaking change against the Go SDK. It removes some functions from the beam package surface, because there were no clear path to using them, and having too many functions on the package surface hurts eventual usability of the docs.\r\n\r\n* beam.Must2 had no uses in the SDK. Keeping Must and MustN since they are used by the SDK.\r\n* beam.EncodeCoder, and beam.DecodeCoder\r\n* beam.EncodeFunc, and beam.DecodeFunc\r\n* beam.EncodeType, and beam.DecodeType\r\n* These were all mostly externalizations of internal functions, used internally to the transport types.\r\n\r\nThere's a small change to the graphx.decodeUserFn semantics in that it now returns the raw anonymous function instead of wrapping it immeadiately. This allows for an allocation optimization for certain user defined coder shapes, avoiding a []byte -> interface{} -> []byte conversion and allocation that it entails. \r\n\r\nMustN functions, if they're used by the beam package must be in the beam package or duplicated in some utility package because of depending on beam.PCollection in the signature.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

make terrible keys, since they aren't currently guaranteed to be coded in the same order for the same set of values by the default encoder. Until the default coder handles maps consistently (that is, maps with the same key,value pair are hashed equivalently for lifting and shuffling), their use should be restricted to ensure beam computes correctly.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
