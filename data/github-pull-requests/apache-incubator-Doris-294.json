Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n1. When Doris BE is deployed with Hadoop, there is an OOM risk in only using BE process memory control limit at present, and additionally use `/proc/meminfo MemAvailable` to control memory;\r\n2. Optimize the log printing of MemTracker, and fix the bug that Jemalloc does not print the log when the process memory exceeds the limit.\r\n3. Print query peak mem usage in `fe.audit.log`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\nWhen useing dorisWrite loading data , DorisWriter create a DorisWriterManager object when Initialize . Meanwhile , in the construction method of DorisWriterManager ,it will create a DorisStreamLoadObserver object . In DorisStreamLoadObserver object , it is mainly to obtain the load host through getLoadHost() method and \"pos\" property . When create a new DorisStreamLoadObserver object , the \"pos\" value always equals 0 ,if you connect BE running streamload task and \"hostList\" connection no change , you always get the same host . This will cause all the streamload tasks to running on the same node, resulting in too many streamload requests for a BE node , cause OOM error.\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\nWhen you obtain the load host, it will be shuffered the \"hostList\" connection firstly, and then obtain the host with pos=0 from the \"hostlist\". If the connection is successful, return the host. If the host connection failed, it will be  incremented obtain the host in the \"hostlist\" until the connection is successful.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [√ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [√] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [√] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [√ ] No\r\n5.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #14301\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are two scenarios in which BE can be built without Java UDF support.\r\n1. Assign `ON` to the environment variable `DISABLE_JAVA_UDF` before build BE.\r\n2. On macOS (M1), the architecture of `libjvm.dylib` under `JAVA_HOME` doesn't match the one of OS. (E.g. We can run JDK (x86_64) on macOS (arm64) through Rosetta 2.)\r\n\r\nIn #14062 , we enable support by default. That will cause a trouble that we can't start BE up which was built without Java UDF support.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n3. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n5. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n6. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-16T02:58:25Z","updated_at":"2022-11-29T02:12:01Z","closed_at":"2022-11-29T02:12:01Z","merged_at":"2022-11-29T02:12:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"0daebde223a5541c35733096649adbafe55db4c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3179409515,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTc5NDA5NTE1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/reviewed","name":"reviewed","color":"F6FD6D","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/14303/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/14303/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/14303/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/statuses/0bbf302ca33af7aa288c369d22c10b4dff7d2f73","head":{"label":"adonis0147:build","ref":"build","sha":"0bbf302ca33af7aa288c369d22c10b4dff7d2f73","user":{"login":"adonis0147","id":1443003,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDMwMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1443003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147","html_url":"https://github.com/adonis0147","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":444722431,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoHs_w","name":"doris","full_name":"adonis0147/doris","private":false,"owner":{"login":"adonis0147","id":1443003,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDMwMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1443003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147","html_url":"https://github.com/adonis0147","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adonis0147/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/adonis0147/doris","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n`boost::stacktrace::stacktrace()` has memory leak, so use glog internal func to print stacktrace.\r\nThe reason for the memory leak of boost::stacktrace is that a state is saved in the thread local of each thread but not actively released. The test found that each thread leaked about 100M after calling boost::stacktrace.\r\nrefer to:\r\nhttps://github.com/boostorg/stacktrace/issues/118\r\nhttps://github.com/boostorg/stacktrace/issues/111\r\n\r\nstacktrace of glog:\r\n```\r\n    @          0x623e381  doris::vectorized::HashJoinNode::_materialize_build_side()\r\n    @          0x6af82ae  doris::vectorized::VJoinNodeBase::open()\r\n    @          0x623d982  doris::vectorized::HashJoinNode::open()\r\n    @          0x548430d  doris::PlanFragmentExecutor::open_vectorized_internal()\r\n    @          0x5483732  doris::PlanFragmentExecutor::open()\r\n    @          0x5463567  doris::FragmentExecState::execute()\r\n    @          0x5465f65  doris::FragmentMgr::_exec_actual()\r\n    @          0x546ec9b  std::_Function_handler<>::_M_invoke()\r\n    @          0x56ba7b1  doris::ThreadPool::dispatch_thread()\r\n    @          0x56b392f  doris::Thread::supervise_thread()\r\n    @     0x7f8ff656f1ca  start_thread\r\n    @     0x7f8ff6d46dd3  __GI___clone\r\n    @              (nil)  (unknown)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nIn previous implementation, when doing list partition prune, we need to generation `rangeToId`\r\nevery time we doing prune.\r\nBut `rangeToId` is actually a static data that should be create-once-use-every-where.\r\n\r\nSo for hive partition, I created the `rangeToId` and all other necessary data structures for partition prunning\r\nin partition cache, so that we can use it directly.\r\n\r\nIn my test, the cost of partition prune for 10000 partitions reduce from 8s -> 0.2s.\r\n\r\nAslo add \"partition\" info in explain string for hive table.\r\n```\r\n|   0:VEXTERNAL_FILE_SCAN_NODE                           |\r\n|      predicates: `nation` = '0024c95b'                 |\r\n|      inputSplitNum=1,

                  |\r\n```\r\n\r\nBug fix:\r\n1. Fix bug that es scan node can not filter data\r\n2. Fix bug that query es with predicate like `where substring(test2,2) = \"ext2\";` will fail at planner phase.\r\n`Unexpected exception: org.apache.doris.analysis.FunctionCallExpr cannot be cast to org.apache.doris.analysis.SlotRef`\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n1. Some problem when quering es version 8: ` Unexpected exception: Index: 0, Size: 0`, will be fixed later.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n4. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n5. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n6. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n7. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n~~Issue Number: close #xxx~~\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nAfter investigating the intermediate object files generated by `GCC`, we can figure out that \r\n`vhash_join_node.cpp.o` and `function_date_or_datetime_computation.cpp.o` are the first and second biggest objects. It took too much time to generate them.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a way to speed the building process up. We can split original source files (.cpp) into smaller ones. As a result, more translation units will be generated, but we can build them in parallel and save the times.\r\n\r\n## Result\r\n\r\n```\r\ntime EXTRA_CXX_FLAGS='-O3' BUILD_TYPE=ASAN ./build.sh --be -j 32\r\n```\r\nBefore: around 50 minutes\r\nAfter: around 35 minutes\r\n\r\n```\r\ntime ./build.sh --be -j 32\r\n```\r\nBefore: around 35 minutes\r\nAfter: around 20 minutes\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-13T15:18:11Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T03:16:50Z","closed_at":"2022-11-14T02:57:11Z","merged_at":"2022-11-14T02:57:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"7bb3792d519cd6432ae5d6bc6e9511f7dc55ed7e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2040870921,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDQwODcwOTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/area/sql/function","name":"area/sql/function","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

concurrent load, some publish timeout happens occasionally. This is cause by meta lock hold by other thread so publish add increase rowset hang for several seconds.\r\n\r\nStorageEngine::start_delete_unused_rowset will hold gc_mutex and it cost a lot of time, so that add_used_rowset wait lock, and compaction modify_rowset or other tablet method will hold meta_lock and call add_unused_rowset which will make meta_lock occupied for too long, finally makes publish timeout.\r\n\r\nIn this pr, I copy unused_rowsets in lock and delete these rowset without lock, makes gc_mutex more lightweight so meta lock can be acquired immediately in publish thread. \r\n\r\nAlso, i modify tablet_rowset_stale_sweep_time_sec to 300 cause too much stable rowset will make tablet_meta too big when save, save_meta will hold meta_lock and than block publish thread\r\n\r\n# Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.
