https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/10337.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `RetryQueryRunner` to call `SpecificQueryRunnable.run()` in its `run()`, so that the segments to query can be determined early enough for `ResultLevelCachingQueryRunner`. In theory, after this change, there might be a little higher chance to see missing segments in response context, but it should be small enough to ignore because the query execution will be likely started immediately right after query distribution tree is constructed.\r\n\r\nI believe we need integration tests for this fix, but I'm not sure how to add it without introducing a metricsMonitor for integration tests.

Description\r\n\r\nThis patch provides a vectorized implementation of the `ANY` aggregators. Since these aggregators already only read 1 value from the column, the performance gain comparing a vectorized implementation and non-vectorized implementation is expected to be minimal (maybe even slightly slower since we read a batch of values).\r\n\r\nHowever, providing a vectorized implementation allows for queries of the following shape to be vectorized\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT id, ANY_VALUE(name), SUM(number) from datasource group by id\r\n```\r\nwhere we know there is a 1:1 mapping between id and name\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR has refactoring around handling `ParseExceptions` in ingestion, so that we can easily support the same logic for parallel task as well. The parseException can be thrown in 2 places on the ingestion side, i.e., when you parse the input data based on input format (in `InputEntityReader`) and when you convert the parsed object to a desired data type (in `IncrementalIndex`). To handle the exceptions in a more structured way, I added `ParseExceptionHandler` which handles all parseExceptions thrown on the ingestion side. \r\n\r\n`FilteringCloseableInputRowIterator` was added to handle common row filters. It also has the parseExceptionHandler to handle parseExceptions thrown while parsing input data. The same parseExceptionHandler instance is passed down to `AppenderatorImpl` to handle parseExceptions thrown while converting parsed objects.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nI'm trying to use more advanced jsonpath inline queries in while ingesting avro data. An example `flattenSpec` would be\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"path\",\r\n  \"name\": \"attribute__test\",\r\n  \"expr\": \"$.attributes[?(@.name == 'somekey')][0].value\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhere the data looks like this (an array of avro records):\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"attributes\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"somekey\",\r\n      \"value\": \"test value\",\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"someotherkey\",\r\n      \"value\": \"other value\",\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHoping to get the following data out in the dimension: `test value`. This would greatly improve Druid's ability to consume more intricate Avro schemas. \r\n\r\nThe problem it seems was that when using queries the`GenericAvroJsonProvider::unwrap` method is called in Jayway, since it throws an exception the query is prevented and thus returning nothing (it silenced via `com.jayway.jsonpath.Option.SUPPRESS_EXCEPTIONS`). It doesn't seems that any wrapping occurs thus it should be safe to just return the object as is.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Description\r\n\r\nChange the default numeric hashing threshold to 1 and make it configurable.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks attached to this PR show that binary searches are not faster\r\nthan doing a set contains check. The attached flamegraph shows the amount of\r\ntime a query spent in the binary search. Given the benchmarks, we can expect\r\nto see roughly a 2x speed up in this part of the query which works out to\r\n~ a 20% faster query in this instance.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1668\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-08-23 at 10 38 55 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44787917/91008091-72122880-e592-11ea-9b88-e9d9943201d6.png\">\r\n\r\nIn this flamegraph, a query is taking ~40% of the time doing a binary search on 4 numbers. The query I used\r\nis not very selective, so it has to do the binary search many times. \r\n\r\nI see a comment on `NUMERIC_HASHING_THRESHOLD` that talks about benchmarks, but I couldn't find any\r\nin the codebase, so I wrote my own hacky ones, just to get a sense for the breaking points. The benchmarks\r\nprobably need a lot of work, and the results should be taken with a grain of salt because I ran most of them\r\nonly 10 times to calculate the average time.\r\n\r\nI tried 3 algorithms: binary search, set contains and a linear search (using LongArraySet as a proxy)\r\nHere's a summary of the results. The results are in ns / operation with a 20% match rate with the match being chosen at random within the list of filter values.\r\n\r\nAlgorithm | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 |\r\n---------- | -- |-- | -- | -- |\r\nBinarySearch | 7.883 | 4.451 | 3.750 | 4.71  \r\nLongOpenHashSet | 3.086 | 3.142 | 3.071 | 4.02 \r\nLongArraySet | 9.856 | 6.077 | 4.151 | 3.28\r\n\r\nI then ran the benchmarks to compare the worst and best case match times for 16 elements in the set. For the worst case, I picked an element at the start of the list (LongArraySet starts iterating from the end of the list) and for the best case, I picked the middle element for the binary search and the last element for the linear search.\r\n\r\nAlgorithm | Worst | Best \r\n---------- | -- |-- \r\nBinarySearch | 5.401 | 2.991 \r\nLongArraySet | 10.985 | 2.908\r\n\r\nThese numbers seem to indicate that the performance gain of not using a set contains is minimal, even with very small sets and will depend on the number of elements in the dataset that will match the filter.\r\n\r\nThese numbers seem to indicate that the contains time is relatively consistent at ~ 3.1 ns / op whereas a binary search operation is almost 2ns per op slower.\r\n\r\nBased on these numbers, I suspect the query above would see ~ 10% gain by switching to using the LongOpenHashSet instead of a binary search, while queries with in filters closer to 16 values would see a bigger benefit. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nFor large InDimFilters, in default mode, the filter does a linear check of the\r\nset to see if it contains either an empty or null. If it does, the empties are\r\nconverted to nulls by passing through the entire list again.\r\n\r\nInstead of this, in default mode, we attempt to remove an empty string from the\r\nvalues that are passed to the InDimFilter. If an empty string was removed, we\r\nadd null to the set\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1659\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-08-23 at 10 12 30 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44787917/91006291-d383c880-e58d-11ea-951b-38ec1bc92255.png\">\r\n\r\nThis flame graph shows that ~18% of query time was just spent checking if a null or empty string exists in the list of values to the InDimFilter. This happened on a join query where a filter was pushed down to the base table. The limit for filter push down was increased to a very large number so that a very large InDimFilter could be generated.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

#9693\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis patch really came from need of supplying few kafka consumer properties such as `bootstrap.servers` using user specific extensible mechanisms similar to `PasswordProvider` . This patch introduces `DynamicConfigProvider` as proposed in #9351 except it is not named `CredentialsProvider` so as to make it useful for dynamic/extensible user configuration in addition to credentials.\r\nAt some point, fixing #9351 should lead to removal of `PasswordProvider` and replace all its usage with `DynamicConfigProvider`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows using all supported partitioning schemes in auto compaction. In addition to that, all tuningConfigs in `ParallelIndexTuningConfig` are now available for auto compaction except for `forceGuaranteedRollup` and configurations related to parse exceptions. `forceGuaranteedRollup` can be computed based on the type of `partitionsSpec` and the configurations related to parse exceptions are not supported by parallel index task yet. These changes can be found in `ClientCompactionTaskQueryTuningConfig`.\r\n\r\n`NewestSegmentFirstIterator` is now modified to allow all partitioning schemes. Before, it always triggered compactions if it finds a segment compacted with non-dynamic partitioning.\r\n\r\n`ParallelIndexSupervisorTask` is also now able to annotate the `lastCompactionState` properly with non-dynamic partitioning. Before, the `lastCompactionState` wasn't stored properly when it runs with multiple subtasks for hash/range partitioning.\r\n\r\nThe web console change is not fixed in this PR.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds vectorization support for Aggregators in the `druid-histogram` extension. While these changes are unlikely to result in the usage of SIMD instructions, they can still help gain performance in two ways I can think of\r\n  - Being more cache-friendly and less number of function calls\r\n  - Enable vectorization for the whole query when one of the participating aggregator is `Approximate Histogram` assuming other aggregators in query support vectorization. \r\n\r\nThe code is refactored to reduce duplicate code. Much of the buffer manipulations are now called from `*HistogramBufferAggregatorInternal` classes which are in-turn used by `*HistogramBufferAggregator` and `*HistogramVectorAggregator` \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThe segment pruning was recently introduced in #9810. This is a nice feature to have, but could have some potential compatibility issues.\r\n\r\n1) We need a flag to disable segment pruning just in case where some unknown bugs exist in pruning hash-partitioned segments.\r\n2) The hash function used to create segments at ingestion time can change over time. I'm not sure whether or not we have ever changed it. If we have ever done, the segment pruning can lead to incorrect query results for those segments partitioned with a different hash function.\r\n\r\nTo address these issues, this PR adds 2 flags, a new query context, `segmentPruning`, and a new `partitionFunction` field in `partitionsSpec`. The `segmentPruning` context is to allow disabling segment pruning at query time. It is enabled by default to keep the current behavior for range-partitioned segments. \r\n\r\nThe new `partitionFunction` field is stored as a new enum, `HashPartitionFunction`. If users specify `partitionFunction` in the ingestion spec, it will be stored for each segment in the metadata store after ingestion so that we can retrieve the proper hash function at query time. This doesn't mean accessing metadata store will be required in the query path. Every segment announced will have the proper `partitionFunction` which was used to create it at ingestion time.\r\n\r\nThe current way for computing hash of partition dimensions is 1) retrieving values of partition dimensions, 2) serializing them into a byte array, 3) and computing hash of the byte array. The new `HashPartitionFunction` enum only defines _how to compute hash of a byte array_. This means, it doesn't do anything with serializing partition dimension values into a byte array. I'm thinking to add \"partition expressions\" so that we can use expressions for hash partitioning in the future. The new enum can work with partition expressions since it's decoupled from how to retrieve values of partition keys and how to serialize them.\r\n\r\nFor hash-partitioned segments, the broker can prune segments only when `partitionFunction` and a non-empty `partitionDimensions` are stored in `shardSpec` and `segmentPruning` is set in query context. The `partitionFunction` is set to null by default unless it is specified by users explicitly.\r\n\r\nI additionally removed `isInChunk()` interface from `ShardSpec` since it's used only in `SingleDimensionShardSpec`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Update on 01/07/20\r\n\r\nAfter more discussion. We have decided to scrap the ability to disable and instead remove the legacy code that emits alerts for segments with no size. This code is thought to be old debugging code that is safe to remove. Now the LogUsedSegments duty gives a helpful log of # of active segments no matter what. and if debug logging is enabled, used segments are logged. This duty has no performance concerns for non-debug clusters meaning there is no reason to add complexity of new config to disable. In future, it may be beneficial depending on future of this duty. But for now it seems like unnecessary code. \r\n\r\n### Update on 12/21/20\r\n\r\nAfter analysis of the utility of this duty, we are now considering disabling this duty by default and not documenting the config to enable it. With the idea being that we will remove the duty altogether in the future if it proves that nobody questions it being off by default. Because of this plan, I added a `Design Review` label to the PR. More input on this plan would be helpful.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nAllows cluster admin to disable the LogUsedSegments coordinator duty if they so choose. This duty does not have any impact on successive duties so disabling it does not cause any change to the state of the cluster after coordination duties complete.\r\n\r\nAs an admin for a large enterprise cluster myself, I have been on the hunt for any optimization I can find in the lifecycle of the coordinator. This patch appears to be low hanging fruit in my efforts. This duty takes ~10 seconds to complete on our largest cluster. We have never used debug logging to log our segments and we have never checked the emitters alert stream for alerts on segments with size `<0`. Therefore, I think it makes sense to give admins the ability to toggle this duty on and off as they see fit.\r\n\r\nNew Config: `druid.coordinator.duties.logUsedSegments.enabled` ... Default: true\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\nI added a config to the `DruidCoordinatorConfig`. The naming scheme of this config can be easily change as the community sees fit. I made my choice in the hope that it is self-explanatory and allows for more future duty specific configs to be added following the same scheme.\r\n\r\nThis config defaults to having the LogUsedSegments duty enabled (keeping inline with current functionality). When the coordinator is becoming a leader and creating its duties, it consults the config object to find out if the LogUsedSegments duty should be added to the duty lists for historical segment management and indexing.\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them.

Release Notes\r\n\r\nA new Coordinator Dynamic Config, `percentOfSegmentsToConsiderPerMove`, has been added. This configuration specifies the percent of served segments that will be considered when picking a segment to potentially move. The coordinator uses this value and the number of currently served segments to calculate the number of segments that will be candidates. It will not consider any segments beyond that calculated number when picking a segment to move. The default value is 100, meaning the coordinator will consider all segments every time it is picking a segment to move. This default leads to the same behavior that existed prior to this configuration being added.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nA large cluster with many segments results in a lot of work being done by the Coordinator in order to complete its duties. I believe that any optimization to coordinator duties can help in a large cluster. This patch gives an experienced admin a knob to turn in order to try and shave some time off of the balance segments duty. As of now, existing Balancer Strategies iterate over all of the segments in the cluster when choosing a segment to move. The first segment candidate is the most likely to be moved and the last segment candidate is the least likely to move. This patch gives an admin the ability to put a limit on the number of segments that will be candidates to be moved. For most cases, I don't think this knob will be needed, but in some large enterprise cases I feel that it could be beneficial.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\nI updated the BalancerStrategy Interface. The pickSegmentToMove method gained a 3rd parameter that specifies the number of segments that should be considered when picking a segment to move. \r\n\r\n`CostBalancerStrategy` (and it's inheriting classes) and `RandomBalancerStrategy` both leverage `ReservoirSegmentSampler` to choose a segment \"at random\" from a list of candidate servers. I updated the required method in `ReservoirSegmentSampler` to adhere to the limiting parameter described above. If the limit is reached, the method picking a segment will break out of its iteration and return immediately.\r\n\r\nCurrently all code paths use a new dynamic coordinator config that an admin can tune if they'd like to put a limiter on this action of picking a segment to move. The default value for the config is such that all segments will be iterated and be candidates to pick. I thought a dynamic config was good because it is flexible and could be leveraged in times such as if you wanted to temporarily boost up the number of segments to move in order rebalance to new servers faster. If doing that, and you also wanted to make this go quicker by not bothering with having so many potential segments to be picked to move.\r\n\r\nThe new dynamic config is `maxSegmentsToConsiderPerMove` with a default of `Integer.MAX_VALUE`\r\n\r\nI call out in the documentation that an admin should be experienced when considering altering this config. I say that because in many cases, the default is fine.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\nAn alternative of this approach would be to restrict what is sent to `pickSegmentToMove` in the first place. I choose not to approach this at this time because I didn't like the idea of either choosing the number of `ServerHolders` to send to `pickSegmentsToMove` or to analyze the `ServerHolders` before picking how many to send to ensure only a certain number of segments are sent. I'd be open to re-assessing whether or not this would be a better approach or not if someone suggests it may be the proper approach.\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

Description\r\n\r\n`HttpIndexingServiceClient` prints the entire task spec when it fails to issue a task, which could be huge especially in parallel task when lots of segments are shuffled. This could end up causing OOM error in the supervisor task. This PR fixes it by logging only task ID. I also cleaned up some wrong logging in `ParallelIndexSupervisorTask`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also changes the ID pattern of compaction/kill tasks when they are submitted by the coordinator. After this PR, the ID of compaction and kill tasks will be prefixed by `coordinator-issued` if they are submitted by coordinator. `api-issued` prefix will be used when a kill task is issued by calling `DataSourcesResource.killUnusedSegmentsInInterval()`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

tag is added because I am still in the process of testing it more thoroughly, However code in current patch is working in preliminary testing. I will also try and add some UTs for the changes. That said, code is totally reviewable.~~\r\n \r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis patch adds support for adding COMPLEX type Dimension column via Extensions, similar support for Metric columns exist.\r\n\r\nMain changes are to add `String getTypeName()` in `ColumnCapabilities` interface and to add `DimensionHandlerUtils.registerDimensionHandlerProvider(String typeName, DimensionHandlerProvider)` to enable extensions to register custom type specific `DimensionHandler`, very similar to existing `ComplexMetrics.registerSerde(..)`\r\n\r\nAfter this patch, Users can have extensions with custom implementations of `DimensionHandler`, `ComplexMetricSerde` \r\n and related interfaces to add COMPLEX type Dimension Column.\r\nIn addition to above, extension would also make `ComplexMetrics.registerSerde(typeName,..)` and `DimensionHandlerUtils.registerDimensionHandlerProvider(typeName,..)` to register custom type specific implementations.\r\n\r\nSide-note: I am using this extensibility to add a `Map<String, String>` type Dimension column for various reasons which will later be added in a separate PR as contrib extension.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ColumnCapabilities`\r\n *

#7931.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue when using JDBC prepared statements through a router. [Per the docs](https://calcite.apache.org/avatica/docs/json_reference.html#requests), all requests either have a top level `connectionId`, or, if part of a prepared statement, the `connectionId` might be nested in a `statementHandle`, so the router will now check for this case. There are probably more magical ways to do this, but this was the most straightforward.\r\n\r\nIntegration tests have been added to test JDBC metadata, statements, and prepared statements to make sure things work on both brokers and routers. The prepared statement query test fails prior to the changes in this patch.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-13T03:20:05Z","updated_at":"2020-09-30T03:51:55Z","closed_at":"2020-08-19T07:18:07Z","merged_at":"2020-08-19T07:18:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"b36dab0fe65557e4aaf675423d61bdaa51501a71","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

and improved the JSON Input component (as seen in the Edit Spec step of the data loader)\r\nSpecifically fixed the issue with the JSON input sometimes moving the cursor when editing, fixed the undo stack.\r\nThe fix is based around maintaining the state of the JSON Input in a single state variable (`InternalValue`) and thus not letting it get desynchronized.\r\n\r\nWhile at it I also added a nice error display in case there is an issue with the JSON\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/90084641-c1bb3f00-dcca-11ea-9e49-b442c00b93a2.png)\r\n\r\nClicking on it takes your cursor to the place with the error which is sweet - doing this required me to nest the Ace editor inside a div which causes a lot of snapshot diffs.\r\n\r\nAlso updated the snapshots for all the users of JSON Input to shallow render so in the future they would be immune to JSON Input structure changes.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-13T01:41:54Z","updated_at":"2020-09-30T03:52:15Z","closed_at":"2020-08-13T19:20:59Z","merged_at":"2020-08-13T19:20:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"748a83cb78832f098cac6ab24c9db6713509d38e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1251906357,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjUxOTA2MzU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Web%20Console","name":"Area

DruidSegmentReader changes:\r\n\r\n1) Remove \"dimensions\" and \"metrics\". They are not necessary, because we\r\n   can compute which columns we need to read based on what is going to\r\n   be used by the timestamp, transform, dimensions, and metrics.\r\n2) Start using ColumnsFilter (see below) to decide which columns we need\r\n   to read.\r\n3) Actually respect the \"timestampSpec\". Previously, it was ignored, and\r\n   the timestamp of the returned InputRows was set to the `__time` column\r\n   of the input datasource.\r\n\r\n(1) and (2) together fix a bug in which the DruidInputSource would not\r\nproperly read columns that are used as inputs to a transformSpec.\r\n\r\n(3) fixes a bug where the timestampSpec would be ignored if you attempted\r\nto set the column to something other than `__time`.\r\n\r\n(1) and (3) are breaking changes.\r\n\r\nWeb console changes:\r\n\r\n1) Remove \"Dimensions\" and \"Metrics\" from the Druid input source.\r\n2) Set timestampSpec to `{\"column\": \"__time\", \"format\": \"millis\"}` for\r\n   compatibility with the new behavior.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n1) Add ColumnsFilter, a new class that allows input readers to determine\r\n   which columns they need to read. Currently, it's only used by the\r\n   DruidInputSource, but it could be used by other columnar input sources\r\n   in the future.\r\n2) Add a ColumnsFilter to InputRowSchema.\r\n3) Remove the metric names from InputRowSchema (they were unused).\r\n4) Add InputRowSchemas.fromDataSchema method that computes the proper\r\n   ColumnsFilter for given timestamp, dimensions, transform, and metrics.\r\n5) Add \"getRequiredColumns\" method to TransformSpec to support the above.","created_at":"2020-08-12T02:47:54Z","updated_at":"2021-08-12T08:17:47Z","closed_at":"2021-03-25T17:32:21Z","merged_at":"2021-03-25T17:32:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"bf20f9e9798417c9293a195690b6adcb48f44d3f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":283617667,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODM2MTc2Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Incompatible","name":"Incompatible","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

`floatMax`\r\n\r\nSummary of changes:\r\n* The vectorized implementations of the above min/max aggregators are each in *`VectorAggregator.java`\r\n*  Adds new unit test classes -- `FloatMinAggregationTest` and `FloatMaxAggregationTest` to test the floatMin and floatMax aggregations.\r\n* Add new test cases and update existing tests in `CalciteQueryTest`, `TimeseriesQueryRunnerTest`, `GroupByQueryRunnerTest` and `GroupByTimeseriesQueryRunnerTest`.\r\n* Update documentation to reflect that these aggregators now have vectorized versions.\r\n\r\n/cc:

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue caused by #9731 when using `ExpressionVirtualColumn` with a single realtime string column input, which is sparsely populated and has not encountered explicit `null` values (to ensure that they are encoded in the dictionary). \r\n\r\nIn the code there is a gentleman's agreement that if `ColumnCapabilities.isDictionaryEncoded` is true then `DimensionSelector.nameLookupPossibleInAdvance` is also true, and `isDictionaryEncoded` appears to be checked primarily in cases where this should also be true. The refactoring done in #9731 broke this loose contract however, since the latter method was modified to return the state of the indexer, but the former value was set as the expected final state.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, a `getColumnCapabilites` method has been added to `DimensionIndexer`, to allow the thing processing all the column values to be the single state of truth about the details of the column. It also frees `IncrementalIndex` from having to track and evolve changes to the capabilities, since it can now be handled within the indexers, though it still maintains a map of static capabilities for the time and aggregator columns.\r\n\r\nPrior to this fix the added tests would explode with an error in the form:\r\n```\r\nSelector of class[org.apache.druid.segment.StringDimensionIndexer$1IndexerDimensionSelector] does not have a dictionary, cannot use it.\r\n```\r\nbecause [of this check](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/segment/virtual/SingleStringInputDimensionSelector.java#L52). \r\n\r\nWhile I was at it, I made `isDictionaryEncoded` be a `Capable` enum, reworked the `snapshot` method to take a new type, `CoercionLogic` which is responsible for determining how each `Capable.UNKNOWN` will be converted to true or false when calling `snapshot`. `merge` is now a static method that internally calls `snapshot` on each `ColumnCapabilities`, also using a `CoercionLogic`. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests

is a method that closes something. It suppresses and logs any\r\nIOExceptions it gets, but re-throws any non-IOExceptions. It is used extensively and it\r\nseems likely to me that most usages did not intend to have these specific behaviors.\r\nSo this patch gets rid of the method and migrates call sites to various more sanely\r\nbehaving methods.\r\n\r\nThese other methods include:\r\n\r\n1) New method CloseableUtils.closeAndWrapExceptions, which wraps IOExceptions\r\n   in RuntimeExceptions for callers that just want to avoid dealing with\r\n   checked exceptions. Most usages were migrated to this method, because it\r\n   looks like they were mainly attempts to avoid declaring a throws clause,\r\n   and perhaps were unintentionally suppressing IOExceptions.\r\n2) New method CloseableUtils.closeInCatch, designed to properly close something\r\n   in a catch block without losing exceptions. Some usages from catch blocks\r\n   were migrated here, when it seemed that they were intended to avoid checked\r\n   exception handling, and did not really intend to also suppress IOExceptions.\r\n3) New method CloseableUtils.closeAndSuppressExceptions, which sends all\r\n   exceptions to a \"chomper\" that consumes them. Nothing is thrown or returned.\r\n   The behavior is slightly different: with this method, _all_ exceptions are\r\n   suppressed, not just IOExceptions. Calls that seemed like they had good\r\n   reason to suppress exceptions were migrated here.\r\n4) Some calls were migrated to try-with-resources, in cases where it appeared\r\n   that CloseQuietly was being used to avoid throwing an exception in a finally\r\n   block.\r\n\r\n🎵 You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here...

an OOM caused by excessive disk persist due to a memory byte estimate of thetasketch type. I think this fix is useful when we have this problem in our production environment. After the second adjustment function is turned on, the performance of the ingestion task is affected to some extent.\r\n\r\nTo fix it, I introduced `MaxIntermediateSizeAdjustStrategy`  in the `OnHeapIncrementalIndex`, it supports for those who need To dynamically adjust the footprint of metric types such as thetasketch, be adjusted synchronously or asynchronously(A thread timing adjustment).\r\n`ThetaSketchSizeAdjustStrategy` extends MaxIntermediateSizeAdjustStrategy,\r\nThe internal data structure of thetasketch adopts the 8-fold expansion mechanism by default,so thetaSketch

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves #10192 . \r\n\r\nThe orignal redis cache extension is designed for standalone redis only, and does not support a couple of redis features which are widely used in production. So This PR updates the redis cache extension to:\r\n\r\n1.  add support for redis cluster\r\n2. allow users to customize which database of a redis they want to use through new property `database`\r\n3. add support for password protected redis servers through new property `password`\r\n4. allow period style configuration for the existing `expiration` and `timeout` properties\r\n\r\n\r\n### Key changes\r\n\r\n1. orignal `RedisCache` is splitted into `AbstractRedisCache` and `RedisStandaloneCache`, the first provides a way to share  common code between standalone and cluster mode redis servers\r\n2. `RedisCacheConfig` is updated to support new properties\r\n3. `RedisClusterCache` which inherits from `AbstractRedisCache` is added to interact with redis clusters\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [X] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

#10229 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR includes 2 sets of fixes to make working with Avro OCF files in the Web Console work seamlessly.\r\n\r\nThe first is fixing the format detection by first changing the detection logic to run against the \"raw\" input rows and also patching the Avro OCF check to only check for the ASCII `Obj` prefix.\r\n\r\nThe second corrects some more fundamental issues that wouldn't have been noticed without the web UI as manual ingestion specs that don't use the sampler API or rely on root field enumeration wouldn't have run into.\r\nFirst of which is that Enum and Fixed types were not properly supported in the `AvroFlattenerMaker`, they wouldn't be listed as root fields and were not properly converted into primitive types.\r\nAdditionally the `AvroFlattenerMaker` didn't override the `ObjectFlatteners#finalizeConversionForMap` method so raw Avro types leaked into the `SamplerResponse`. The raw Avro types aren't configured to be mapped correctly so were causing errors when serialising `SamplerResponse` whilst using the Web UI. This is what led to the discovery of Enum and Fixed not being supported correctly.\r\n\r\nA follow up to this PR will likely include tests for `AvroOCFReader#sample` in a similar vein to what exists for `ParquetReader`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n *

to #8560 \r\n\r\nThis feature adds several bitwise expressions to be used on ingestion.\r\n\r\n**Use Case**\r\n\r\nSay you're doing CDC and your source table has a column of binary flags. For OLAP queries, it's extremely useful to have these flags extracted out into their own dimensions which can be done now on ingestion via the new expressions.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n- You might have a column in your source DB called `flags` that represents a series of binary flags. Bit 1 might mean an order was placed on mobile, bit 2 might mean it was purchased on web, bit 4 might mean it was the users first purchase.\r\n- Instead of ingesting the raw integer value of the `flags` column, you can break these columns out into something like `mobile_ind`, `web_ind`, `first_purchase_ind` where your expression can be `bitwiseAnd(flags, 1)`, `bitwiseAnd(flags, 2)`, `bitwiseAnd(flags, 4)`.\r\n\r\nDruid SQL currently does not support bitwise operations (#8560) which makes these even more valuable IMO.\r\n\r\n**Tested on a local cluster**\r\n\r\nIngestion spec:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"index_parallel\",\r\n  \"spec\": {\r\n    \"ioConfig\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"index_parallel\",\r\n      \"inputSource\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"inline\",\r\n        \"data\": \"\\\"x\\\",\\\"y\\\"\\n4,2\\n8,4\\n16,8\\n3,2\\n5,2\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"inputFormat\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"csv\",\r\n        \"findColumnsFromHeader\": true\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    \"tuningConfig\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"index_parallel\",\r\n      \"partitionsSpec\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"dynamic\"\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    \"dataSchema\": {\r\n      \"dataSource\": \"bitwise_test\",\r\n      \"granularitySpec\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"uniform\",\r\n        \"queryGranularity\": \"NONE\",\r\n        \"rollup\": false,\r\n        \"segmentGranularity\": \"YEAR\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"timestampSpec\": {\r\n        \"column\": \"!!!_no_such_column_!!!\",\r\n        \"missingValue\": \"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"transformSpec\": {\r\n        \"transforms\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"type\": \"expression\",\r\n            \"name\": \"zBitwiseAnd\",\r\n            \"expression\": \"bitwiseAnd(CAST(x, 'LONG'), CAST(y, 'LONG'))\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"type\": \"expression\",\r\n            \"name\": \"zBitwiseOr\",\r\n            \"expression\": \"bitwiseOr(CAST(x, 'LONG'), CAST(y, 'LONG'))\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"type\": \"expression\",\r\n            \"name\": \"zBitwiseComplement\",\r\n            \"expression\": \"bitwiseComplement(CAST(x, 'LONG'))\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"type\": \"expression\",\r\n            \"expression\": \"bitwiseShiftLeft(CAST(x, 'LONG'), CAST(y, 'LONG'))\",\r\n            \"name\": \"zBitwiseShiftLeft\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"type\": \"expression\",\r\n            \"name\": \"zBitwiseShiftRight\",\r\n            \"expression\": \"bitwiseShiftRight(CAST(x, 'LONG'), CAST(y, 'LONG'))\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"type\": \"expression\",\r\n            \"name\": \"zBitwiseXor\",\r\n            \"expression\": \"bitwiseXor(CAST(x, 'LONG'), CAST(y, 'LONG'))\"\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      \"dimensionsSpec\": {\r\n        \"dimensions\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"type\": \"long\",\r\n            \"name\": \"x\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"type\": \"long\",\r\n            \"name\": \"y\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"type\": \"long\",\r\n            \"name\": \"zBitwiseAnd\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"type\": \"long\",\r\n            \"name\": \"zBitwiseComplement\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"type\": \"long\",\r\n            \"name\": \"zBitwiseOr\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"type\": \"long\",\r\n            \"name\": \"zBitwiseShiftLeft\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"type\": \"long\",\r\n            \"name\": \"zBitwiseShiftRight\"\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            \"type\": \"long\",\r\n            \"name\": \"zBitwiseXor\"\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-08-01 18-27-54](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3860450/89112251-f8bd6500-d42d-11ea-8aff-33f761a34f61.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nRelated to #9953, this PR adds a simple naive implementation of an `IndexedTable` backed by Druid segments ingested with some extra information to identify which columns are 'join keys' at ingestion time, through the use of a custom segmentizer factory, via the changes done in #9957:\r\n```\r\n      \"indexSpec\": {\r\n        \"segmentLoader\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"broadcastJoinableMMapSegmentFactory\",\r\n          \"keyColumns\": [\"col1\", \"col2\", \"col3\"]\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n```\r\nThis is probably longer term done better as being part of `ColumnCapabilities`, maybe a `isJoinKey` method, but since there might be other optimizations/customizations to the segment we are writing out to use for joins, I wanted to defer this change to future work to determine if there is a better segment format for this use case.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is based on and similar to `RowBasedIndexedTable`, but is fed with a `QueryableIndexSegment` which is scanned and the key columns are read to create the value indexes of the key columns, which are stored in heap memory in a list of hashmaps. The intention is that these will only be created for datasources that are configured to have a 'broadcast' load rule, which will propagate the entire dataset across the cluster, allowing the table to be used for more efficient joins.\r\n\r\nThe `SegmentManager` has been modified to extend `DataSourceState` to also contain a map of `SegmentId` to another newly added class in this PR, `ReferenceCountingIndexedTable` (related #9982), which ties the lifecycle of these tables to the segment that is backing them. \r\n\r\nA new `BroadcastTableJoinableFactory` has been added which is injected with the `SegmentManager` to allow fetching the indexed tables from these broadcast segments to construct into a `Joinable`, binding to `GlobalTableDatasource` introduced in #10020.\r\n\r\nSince it is an extension point, I have also reworked `JoinableFactory` a bit to allow binding multiple implementations to the same `DataSource` class, and so now is handled with 2 bindings, a `MapBinder<Class<? extends JoinableFactory>, Class<? extends DataSource>>` and a `Multibinder<JoinableFactory>` to provide `MapJoinableFactory` so it can build a `SetMultimap<Class<? extends DataSource>, JoinableFactory>`, which it will now try each factory when building a `Joinable`, returning the first that produces results. \r\n\r\nUnit tests and an integration test have been added to test this functionality, and the integration test also should cover much of the broadcast changes done in service of #9953.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds no new documentation yet, since **the functionality should still be considered experimental**, but I'll consider how to best document it before the next release and do it in a future follow-up PR. \r\n\r\n**Also note that there are currently some limitations with `BroadcastTableJoinableFactory`, most obviously that it only supports joins to single segment datasources.** The `SegmentManager` itself does not care and will load any number of segments and tables, but joinable construction will fail. Part of the reason for this limitation is that I'm not certain the best way to resolve this, we could either make a composite IndexedTable that can in essence 'page' through it's sub-tables, or, we make a version of the join matcher that can handle a collection of tables, (or something else entirely?). It needs further investigation.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR adds a computed `hasNulls` property to `ColumnCapabilities` in service of allowing segment metadata queries to accurately report which columns have null values via the updated `ColumnAnalysis`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes a bug with filtering numeric null values on the numeric dimension indexers, where the null values were being treated as nulls rather than default values in default null handling mode, meaning a query against an incremental index would not produce results consistent with after it was persisted into a segment. This bug was being masked by the way `BaseFilterTest` was creating its test data, which would automatically turn all `null` rows into default values to handle the `rowBasedWithoutTypeSignature` finisher, but is now actually how the incremental index handles null valued rows. I've modified `BaseFilterTest` to have a property `canTestNumericNullsAsDefaultValues` which will allow special handling for the `rowBasedWithoutTypeSignature` finisher and allow treating it as sql compatible mode, even when it isn't, in order to not hide future issues like this, and dropped the magic null to default value logic that was creating the test data.\r\n\r\nIn a follow-up PR, with this information in place, `RowSignature` can be expanded to also track the nullable columns, allowing the SQL planner to more correctly plan a query based on whether or not a column has nulls instead of tying it to `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull`. `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` will also correctly set `IS_NULLABLE`. This change is moderately disruptive to tests however, so I decided to split it out to keep things easy to review.\r\n\r\nOther follow-up work to do after this PR is modifying the query engines to take advantage of this new information by examining the column capabilities instead of using the global value of `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull`, for example to decide if `NullableNumericAggregator` needs to be employed for numeric primitive aggregations to handle null or not.\r\n\r\nLonger term, I would like to remove/repurpose `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull` and make Druid always be in SQL compatible mode, and at ingestion time just specify on the dimension specs which columns can and cannot have null values and what the default value should be (like other databases). I expect a setting will remain once the dust is settled on how to handle `null` and `''` for legacy string columns created in default mode, but I think it should be possible to transition everywhere else to just always operate in SQL compatible null handling mode with little disruption.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis change allows Druid users to configure a regional endpoint for STS in their Kinesis ingest specs. Configuring a regional endpoint rather than using the default global endpoint is [recommended by AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html). This is also an internal requirement for running our Druid cluster.\r\n\r\nI added an optional `awsStsEndpoint` configuration value to the `KinesisIndexTaskIOConfig` class. When this value is present, the `AWSSecurityTokenServiceClientBuilder` has endpoint configuration applied.\r\n\r\nI picked the name `awsStsEndpoint` to align with the existing configuration values `awsAssumedRoleArn` and `awsExternalId`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a

#10193.\r\n\r\n`CuratorLoadQueuePeon` no longer deletes segment load/drop entries in case `druid.coordinator.load.timeout` expires. Deleting these entries after a timeout can cause the balancer to work incorrectly, as described in the linked issue.\r\n\r\nWith this fix, the segment entries will remain in the load/drop queue for a peon until the ZK entry is deleted by the historical, unless a non-timeout related exception occurs. This helps the balancer to account for the actual queue size for historicals and can lead to better balancing decisions.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

patch adds vectorization support for the `longMin` aggregator to speed up queries that use the `MIN` aggregator.\r\n\r\nSummary of changes:\r\n- Added a new class `LongMinVectorAggregator` that implements the `VectorAggregator` interface.\r\n- Modified some existing test cases to include this vectorized in `SchemaEvolutionTest`.\r\n- Added a new simple test case to each `CalciteQueryTest` and `TimeseriesQueryRunnerTest`. Modified some test cases in `TimeseriesQueryRunnerTest` and `GroupByQueryRunnerTest`, `SchemaEvolutionTest` to demonstrate that vectorization _does_ work for the `longMin` aggregator.\r\n- Enabled null handling in the `LongMinAggregatorTest` to test both null-compatibility and non null-compatibility code paths.\r\n- Query context documentation update.\r\n- Miscellaneous minor tweaks to java doc comments.\r\n\r\nOnce this is reviewed, I am hoping to also do the other min and max aggregators for float/double/long types, so we can trim down the list of aggregators that do not support vectorization :). Also, please suggest if I could add more tests or modify existing ones to ensure more code coverage, so the new code paths are exercised. Thanks!\r\n\r\n/cc: @gianm @jihoonson

wide default query context setting\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSometimes when external solutions such as Looker connect to Druid, users cannot easily specify query context parameters. \r\n\r\nThis PR allows user to use runtime properties (druid.query.override.default.context.*) to override any default value in QueryContext. The order of precedence is as follow: hard_coded_default_value <- runtime_properties <- query_context_parameter\r\n\r\nNote that this changes the key for setting vectorize and vectorSize in the runtime property from druid.query.vectorize and druid.query.vectorSize to druid.query.override.default.context.vectorize and druid.query.override.default.context.vectorSize respectively. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR solves #9998 \r\n\r\nIn Druid, there're lots of byte-related properties. In the world of big data, the value of these properties are usually very large.\r\n\r\nFor example, \r\n\r\n````\r\ndruid.server.maxSize=300000000000 \r\n````\r\n\r\nAt first glance of this configuration, it's hard to tell how many bytes `druid.server.maxSize` hold. User have to count the number digit by digit to know it's 300_000_000_000.  Changing its value is also error-prone.\r\n\r\nSo this PR adds support of unit suffix to the value of these properties, like how we specify the value of `Xms` or `Xmx` properties of JVM,  to make configurations more convenient and intuitive. \r\n\r\nWith this PR, we could set `druid.server.maxSize` as below:\r\n\r\n````\r\ndruid.server.maxSize=300m\r\n# or\r\ndruid.server.maxSize=300g\r\n# or\r\ndruid.server.maxSize=3t\r\n````\r\n\r\nBecause K(or M/G/T) is ambiguous in computer, whether it's 1000 or 1024 is context related. This PR defines the supported units and their bases as follow\r\n\r\n| Unit | Description | Base |\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n| K | Kilo Decimal Byte | 1_000 |\r\n| M | Mega Decimal Byte | 1_000_000 |\r\n| G | Giga Decimal Byte | 1_000_000_000 |\r\n| T | Tera Decimal Byte | 1_000_000_000_000 |\r\n| P | Peta Decimal Byte | 1_000_000_000_000_000 |\r\n| KiB | Kilo Binary Byte | 1024 |\r\n| MiB  | Mega Binary Byte | 1024 * 1024 |\r\n| GiB | Giga Binary Byte | 1024 * 1024 * 1024 |\r\n| TiB  | Tera Binary Byte | 1024 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 |\r\n| PiB  | Peta Binary Byte | 1024 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 |\r\n\r\nSo, \r\n\r\n````\r\ndruid.server.maxSize=300m # 300_000_000 bytes\r\n````\r\n````\r\ndruid.server.maxSize=300MiB # 300*1024*1024 bytes\r\n````\r\n\r\nOf course, the old ways are still supported\r\n````\r\ndruid.server.maxSize=300000000 # 300M bytes\r\n````\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nThis PR\r\n1.  adds a `HumanReadableBytes` class to parse the new format of value and turns it into long-format value. With this class, it's easy to turn number formatted property into this new format\r\n2. adds a `HumanReadableBytesRange` annotation to constraint the range of a `HumanReadableBytes` property\r\n3. changes 8 properties to support this feature\r\n\r\n    - druid.cache.sizeInBytes\r\n    - druid.indexer.runner.maxZnodeBytes\r\n    - druid.processing.buffer.sizeBytes\r\n    - druid.server.maxSize\r\n    - druid.server.http.maxScatterGatherBytes\r\n    - druid.broker.http.maxQueuedBytes\r\n    - druid.processing.buffer.sizeBytes\r\n    - maxSize within druid.segmentCache.locations\r\n\r\n4. changes the default value of properties above in example configuration files to use the simplified format\r\n    \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [X] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-22T05:44:54Z","updated_at":"2021-02-01T18:57:41Z","closed_at":"2020-07-31T01:58:49Z","merged_at":"2020-07-31T01:58:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"646fa84d043a075e64efa0d65205a17b066204e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":145651458,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDU2NTE0NTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Ease%20of%20Use","name":"Ease

ITSqlInputSourceTest so that it uses the correct ingestion spec.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nITSqlInputSourceTest has a typo which causes it to use incorrect ingestion spec (that does not use the Sql inputSource). This PR corrects this by updating ITSqlInputSourceTest to use the correct ingestionSpec that has the Sql inputSource. Additionally, batch-index test group was already very close to timeout and updating the ITSqlInputSourceTest to use the correct IngestionSpec can occasionally cause the batch-index test group to go over the limit. Hence, this PR also moves ITSqlInputSourceTest out into its own group.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths,

integration tests for Appends\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe native batch ingestion currently allows appending dynamically partitioned segments regardless of the original partitioning scheme. The new integration tests include the followings:\r\n\r\n- Append dynamically-partitioned segments to a dynamically-partitioned datasource\r\n- Append dynamically-partitioned segments to a hash-partitioned datasource. Compact hash-partitioned segments and dynamically-partitioned segments after append.\r\n- Append dynamically-partitioned segments to a range-partitioned datasource. Compact range-partitioned segments and dynamically-partitioned segments after append.\r\n\r\nSome notes on the tests:\r\n- Note that the intervals of the appended segment overlap with those of original segments. This is done by using the same data for initial write and append.\r\n- Batch append itself is pretty well covered by unit tests (the unit tests mimic the distributed ingestion using multi-threaded ingestion testing framework (see AbstractParallelIndexSupervisorTaskTest). The integration tests focus on missing parts such as querying segments of mixed partitioning schemes.\r\n\r\nNote: This PR also updates Integration Test's areSegmentsLoaded/getLoadStatus to use the new API to verify a datasource has the latest ingested data (https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9965) instead of a Cluster wide loadstatus API. There are two benefits. First, we are now able to query status of a specific datasource, allowing multiple integration tests to be run concurrently. Second, we are able to take advantage of the new API's `forceMetadataRefresh` to make sure that we get latest published segment information (and compare/verify against the latest published segment information). This allows us to verify the segment count after the task finished. (Note that because of this, ITAutoCompactionTest.java test was also updated to verify segment count of only used and non-overshadowed segments).  \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-15T05:02:31Z","updated_at":"2020-09-30T03:53:06Z","closed_at":"2020-07-20T20:43:13Z","merged_at":"2020-07-20T20:43:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"0cabc53bd56b49ef32e63ff536d0d193c9144baf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":303259531,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDMyNTk1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Testing","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nThe servers table can throw NPE if you have a historical that announced its node role, but not itself in the server view (`server` can be null [at here](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/sql/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/sql/calcite/schema/SystemSchema.java#L502)). This PR fixes this NPE and cleans up some unnecessary method calls. It also fixes the servers table to handle optional data servers which can serve broadcast segments. ~After this PR, the servers table will return all fields properly if they are found in the server view. Otherwise, some fields such as `tier`, `maxSize`, and `currentSize` will be filled with nulls.~ I reverted the null handling change to not change the current behavior. If we want to fix the null handling, we should fix it for all tables in system schema and information schema. It would be better to do in a separate PR, probably along with https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9896.\r\n\r\nThe web console changes are not included in this PR. There will be a follow-up for it.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nA follow-up of #10082. This PR adds new integration tests for `RetryQueryRunner`. To mimic the case where historicals can report missing segments, this integration tests use 2 historicals, one normal historical and a historical modified for these tests. This modified historical announces all segments assigned, but it can report missing segments for some of them. To run them separately from other tests, these tests were added as a new test group, `query-retry`. The modified historical is spawned only for this test group.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

JettyTest.testNumConnectionsMetricHttp flaky test\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe unit test, JettyTest.testNumConnectionsMetricHttp, has been observed to be flaky. Such as in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10027#issuecomment-648684719 and in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9661#issuecomment-611875446\r\n\r\nThe test waits for number of active connection on the Jetty JettyServerModule to be 0 before running tests. For some unknown reason the active connection is > 0 and even after sleeping/retry is still > 0. This causes the test to fail.\r\n\r\nHowever, this test is very rarely flaky. I have try to run the test job containing the flaky test in equivalent Travis environment over 100 times and could not get it to fail (See: https://travis-ci.com/github/maytasm/druid/builds/175034012).\r\n\r\nThe test is already doing the following:\r\n- Using random port between each retry.\r\n- Retry check of active connection every 10 ms over 10000 ms total.\r\n \r\nSince the test rarely fails, this PR aims to achieve the following:\r\n- Increase return check of active connection to every 10 ms over 15000 ms total. Hopefully, this will further reduce the probability of the test failing.\r\n- Improve error message when test fails to indicate the number of active connection and the port that was used. \r\n\r\nNote: an alternative is to start the test at the number of open connections instead of 0, and just test for 1 above that and make sure it goes back down to where it started or below. However, as we are not sure how unexpected connections are from, there may as well be connections opening or closing while the test is running (between recording initialize connection number and verifying final connection number).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid
