CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nSQLLAB_BACKEND_PERSISTENCE feature stores the results in the results backend which is used to rehydrate tab states. Data is incorrectly being returned in serialized binary form due to the assumption that if we're storing results the query is being executed asynchronously. This pr fixes that assumption by also checking if we're looking to return results (in which case we also use the df_to_records and JSON serialization approach). \r\n\r\nThis is obviously not the most performant way of handling this as were doing pyarrow + msgpack to store the results in the results backend, as well as pandas + json to return the results, however it's the easiest way to get SQLLAB_BACKEND_PERSISTENCE + RESULTS_BACKEND_USE_MSGPACK working together without a significant rewrite/refactor. \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n- [x] tested locally that sqllab works with SQLLAB_BACKEND_PERSISTENCE feature enabled\r\n- [x] tested locally that sqllab works with SQLLAB_BACKEND_PERSISTENCE feature disabled\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nlogging.xxx(<log message here>) has the effect of logging directly to the ROOT logger regardless of the module that's writing out the given message. Instead of following this pattern, it's best practice to instead fetch the logger for each module at init and then use it for all logging within said module. This allows for tuning of log levels on a per module basis.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI intend to deploy to testing environment and verify logs. This may also affect log messages when runing CLI, so that should be looked at as well.\r\n\r\n###

CATEGORY\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [x] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nImplements changes outlined in [SIP-32](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/8805).\r\n\r\nRemoves the need for a symlink from `superset/static` to `superset/assets` by moving \"assets\" to a new top-level `/superset-frontend` directory.\r\n\r\nWebpack now outputs into the `superset/static/assets` folder, copying any necessary assets.\r\n\r\nSimplifies `MANIFEST.in`. Excluding frontend source is no longer necessary since the source doesn't live in the backend directory.\r\n\r\nRemoving two more symlinks between frontend assets and docs, instead copying built files to the `static` folder. This was necessary because copying the built files breaks these symlinks, but it also cleans up the directory structure.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nRunning `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, and `npm run dev-server` all seem to work correctly. \r\nBuilding the tarball seems to work fine, but could use additional verification as I'm not sure what all the failure states there might be.\r\nDocker build seems to work fine, but could use more verification here as well.\r\nWhether CI still works remains to be seen, this PR will test that.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: Closes #8805 \r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@nytai @willbarrett @mistercrunch @craig-rueda @rusackas @dpgaspar @DiggidyDave @villebro

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR corrects running of specific tests in `tox`, i.e., \r\n\r\n```bash\r\ntox -e py36-mysql tests/sqllab_tests.py \r\n```\r\n\r\nwhereas previously this would have run as, \r\n\r\n```bash\r\ntox -e py36-mysql tests tests/sqllab_tests.py \r\n```\r\n\r\nmeaning the entire test suite was run prior to the test(s) for interest. `tox` provides a mechanism for default positional arguments (per [here](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example/general.html#interactively-passing-positional-arguments)) and thus these are equivalent (the first being the default) for running the entire suite:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ntox -e py36-mysql\r\ntox -e py36-mysql tests\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote when running individual tests I ran into the `RuntimeError: Working outside of application context.` error during the import phase. The fix is to add the `import tests.test_app` import (which creates the app context) where necessary. I believe the entire test suite worked only because the first file alphabetically included the import.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

that PyArrow can't handle natively.\r\n\r\nRelevant issues:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/4802\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-5645\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

leverage temporary file logic. The  `filename` is an absolute path (with the `config[\"UPLOAD_FOLDER\"]` prefix and contains a secure file name) and thus there's no need to prefix it again. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n`json_metadata` fields weren't being properly populated from the bootstrap data in `getInitialState`. Now all fields are present. Not sure why we were doing extra work to exclude those fields from the state object.\r\n\r\nI also swapped out the plain old `<textarea>` for a fancy schmancy `<AceEditor>`\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"882\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-02-05 at 10 23 29 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1858430/73870852-9f1f0980-4801-11ea-8539-5fd2c09ed8e8.png\">\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"872\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-02-04 at 6 09 39 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1858430/73804711-879c3e00-4779-11ea-968d-4ec9cbbc39e7.png\">\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nI verified these locally:\r\n1. Make sure dashboard metadata is displayed in its entirety instead of just specific fields.\r\n2. Make sure that including all the metadata fields does not somehow break other dashboard functionality. \r\n3. Edit data, save, reload, make sure edits were persisted.\r\n4. Try to provide broken data to the new JSON editor\r\n\r\nCould use some additional verification on item 2.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and

A dashboard with refresh_frequency (> 0) will auto force-refresh itself periodically once it is loaded in browser. But this auto-refresh event is not logged correctly in current dashboard logging mechanism. \r\n\r\nThis PR is to add auto refresh event, and a little code refactor for the period rendering

codebase. We would like to be able to disable these endpoints inside of Preset until a front-end is adopted. In order to do that, I have added a feature flag to selectively enable the endpoints provided by `TagView`. I believe this change will primarily impact the deployment at Lyft (@betodealmeida @DiggidyDave)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

But when a user opens a dashboard and visits another browser tab right away, the dashboard won’t start loading its slices until the user goes back to focus on this browser tab: [https://superuser.com/questions/779021/google-chrome-background-tabs-dont-load-build-until-selected]\r\n\r\nModern browser supports Page Visibility API to detect current webpage's visibility:\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Page_Visibility_API\r\nThis PR is to check if user is focused on other browser tab and Superset dashboard is hidden. If so, we should log it as a special case:\r\n<img width=\"992\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-02-01 at 11 03 14 PM\"

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading Presto from v0.188 to v0.224 we noticed an issue with the `ORDER  BY` logic due to ambiguity which had changed, i.e., per [here](https://support.treasuredata.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008414094-Presto-0-188-to-0-205-Migration):\r\n\r\n> The general rules for ORDER BY behavior are now:\r\n> \r\n> - ORDER BY is executed after projection\r\n> - ORDER BY prefers an ordinal alias wherever possible\r\n> - Input and output columns can be used in the ORDER BY clause, but if there is ambiguity, the output columns have higher precedence\r\n\r\nThough it's up to the individual SQLAlchemy dialect to handle how it translates a SQLAlchemy statement to a string we need to ensure that the SQLAlchemy statement is structured correctly. i.e., the `ORDER BY` clause references the same objects as the `SELECT` clause where appropriate. \r\n\r\nHere's a basic toy example, \r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sqlalchemy.sql import literal_column, select\r\n\r\na = literal_column(\"SUM(x)\").label(\"total\")\r\nb = literal_column(\"SUM(x)\").label(\"total\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Current \r\n\r\nHere we are using **different** SQLAlchemy `Column` objects for the `SELECT` clause and `ORDER BY` clause expressions, akin to the current logic, where the output label isn't being rendered in the `ORDER BY` clause:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(str(select([a]).order_by(b)))\r\n>>> SELECT SUM(x) AS total ORDER BY SUM(x)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Proposed\r\n\r\nHere we are using the **same** SQLAlchemy `Column` objects for the `SELECT` clause and `ORDER BY` clause expressions, where the output label is being rendered in the `ORDER BY` clause.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(str(select([a]).order_by(a)))\r\n>>> SELECT SUM(x) AS total ORDER BY total\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the table visualization type we add the `SORT BY` to the list of metrics (this is probably a requirement for some dialects) as the `ORDER BY` clause is executed after the projection (`SELECT`) and thus the `ORDER BY` expressions need to be present in the `SELECT` clause.\r\n\r\nThis PR simply ensures that we reference the metric object in the `ORDER BY` clause if defined. Note there are probably other places during the SQL construction phase where we're probably not building the query in a cohesive manner. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!---

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nOur instance of superset has large numbers of schemas and tables, so the sql lab autocomplete corpus can be around 40k elements long. Performing the object spread operator was taking up about 50% of the execution time, and removing was able to improve performance from 100ms per keystroke to 40ms.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWhen user opens a large dashboard, it may trigger a large amount of data request to backend. Most browser only allow 6 concurrent requests to the same domain. So we use sub-domains (and domain sharding) in airbnb to allow more concurrent requests. If the chart data is well cached, the result of domain-sharding is very positive.\r\n\r\nWhen user open a large dashboard and its content is not well cached, all the slots are blocked by slow queries. At the same time if user tries to make API call to backend, there will be no response in the page. for example, check/uncheck fav star, save dashboard edit etc. This make user confused and feel dashboard is broken.\r\n\r\nIn the environment with domain sharding feature enabled, we can allocate a domain dedicated for user events. This PR is to free the main domain away from chart loading (which will only use sub-domains provided by configuration **SUPERSET_WEBSERVER_DOMAINS**), so that user interactivity won't be blocked by slow queries.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nadded unit test\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@etr2460 @robdiciuccio @mistercrunch

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [X] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nSome endpoints on Superset, notably the connection test endpoint, would display full stacktraces when a connection test failed. We want to display the underlying error message to help with configuration of database connections, but not the full stacktrace. The connection test endpoint was also returning a 500 when a connection did not succeed - a 400 would be more accurate, as the system is attempting to validate user input.\r\n\r\nThe front-end of this endpoint was looking at the wrong key in the returned dictionary for the error message as well.\r\n\r\nEventually this should be moved under /api/v1, but I'll save that for a different PR.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n- [ ] Attempt a connection test

breaking change in v0.29.0 which we weren't aware of. \r\n\r\nGiven that this change is breaking, i.e., it does not fallback to the previous non-database specific caching configuration,  I thought it was prudent to add this in case other deployments were tripped up by this change.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nAdds support for Cockroach DB.\r\n\r\nI could not test the change becaues the container always fails with\r\n```\r\nsuperset_1         | standard_init_linux.go:211: exec user process caused \"no such file or directory\"\r\n```\r\nbut this seems unrelated to my change.\r\n\r\nSo far I could use Cockroach DB in superset even without explicit support, only the time grain options were missing. \r\n\r\nI verified that the time grain options declared by PostgresEngineSpec work with Cockroach DB.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nAdd a Cockroach DB datasource, add tables and test charts.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: Fixes #9032\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nSome databases, like Snowflake, support defining UDFs per schema. This PR adds the possibility to retrieve both global functions and schema-specific UDFs, and implements said functionality for Snowflake. Achieving this required moving the function retrieval logic from the database API to the table API, and making small modifications in the frontend code.\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOTS\r\nIn the first picture we are browsing a schema where the UDF `SFWHO` is available: \r\n<img width=\"697\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-01-28 at 17 51 54\"

[ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAs the recent work to replace the FAB CRUD views does not support all the features provided by FAB (mainly, the various filters), a config option is necessary. This config allows for the server rendered CRUD view replacement work to proceed in master without a user facing loss of functionality. Users can also optionally enable the new react views.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n- toggling ENABLE_REACT_CRUD_VIEWS on renders the new react list view.\r\n- toggling ENABLE_REACT_CRUD_VIEWS off renders the old FAB CRUD list view.\r\n\r\n###

This is preferred to setting the cache to `None` so that we can assume a cache is always initialized and calls to `cache.memoize()` will never fail.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nAs I tested this further, I realized that this was making a query to every presto and hive db whenever you open SQL Lab or open a new SQL Lab tab. This PR caches the result of the `show function` query as we don't expect it to change often.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nAdd a print statement to the function, see it the first time I open SQL Lab, but then when opening subsequent SQL Lab tabs, don't see the print statement again\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\"

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where the values for the sunburst chart (which takes in a list of lists order by the hierarchical columns) were being named incorrectly. The reason being is the resulting `pandas.DataFrame` column ordering is not the same as the ordering defined in the hierarchy. \r\n\r\nThe fix is to simply re-order the `pandas.DataFrame` columns to adhere to the column ordering specified in the hierarchy. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nTested locally for a

Superset front-end treat it as error. But the result will still be cached.\r\nIn front-end logging, we don't log is_cached status when chart has error. this may cause our cache rate not accurate.

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWe have a lot of table names with numbers in them, which then results in really bad autocompletes with phrases like `GROUP BY 1` or `LIMIT 1000` autocompleting to `GROUP BY long_table_name_v01` or `LIMIT bigger_table_10_plus_100` (for example). This PR disables autocomplete when you start a word with a number, so prefixes like `2019` and `10foo` won't autocomplete, but `superset_v01` and `foo29` will.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTest the above examples and ensure the behavior is correct, `npm run lint`, and CI\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nSQL Lab queries against databases with nested columns/results containing structs or maps are failing with the following error:\r\n```\r\npyarrow.lib.ArrowNotImplementedError: Not implemented type for list in DataFrameBlock: struct<...>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSerializing results to JSON is not the ideal solution, mainly for performance reasons, but there are pending fixes yet to be released in Arrow 1.0 that may improve the situation:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/6199\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nEnsure queries against databases containing nested columns (particularly arrays containing maps) are successful. Per https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/8978, the following query should succeed and produce the proper results:\r\n```\r\nSELECT id, json_agg(json_build_object('table_name',table_name,'database_id',database_id)) FROM (SELECT * FROM tables) AS tables GROUP BY id\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

returned an `pd.DataFrame` object (I missed the if statement [here](https://github.com/druid-io/pydruid/blob/80cf6fe767817c8c30e908ea2e145bee09aa6d9b/pydruid/query.py#L164) and thus it could be `None`. \r\n\r\nI noticed another case where we don't check whether the Pandas dataframe exists (see [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/1f6f4ed879a3bb34a50a48b55fc42c570ece8b51/superset/connectors/druid/models.py#L987)) but this is outside of the scope of the original

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSome deployments with charts backed by the legacy Druid NoSQL connector can't simply go cold turkey on fully disabling Druid however we would like to wean ourselves off of Druid starting by removing the option to scan for new or refresh the metadata of the Druid datasources. Note the later menu item is somewhat of a misnomer as it refreshes all Druid datasource from the source and not just those currently registered in Superset. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a config option to simply remove the view items for scanning/refreshing Druid datasources.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### BEFORE \r\n\r\nWhen `DRUID_IS_ACTIVE = True` (non-default) and

`snowflake-sqlalchemy` which currently requires `asn1crypto>0.24`.

file. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nAny changes should be either imperceptible, or in a couple cases, barely perceptible, in the case of a couple border-radius properties that were moved from 5px to 4px. If anyone needs those screenshots, I can slog through to find/add them.\r\n\r\nThere was also one timing that was sped up, from 1s to 0.3s, in the dashboard editor.

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nOn the \"What’s new in 1.0.0 (??)\" page https://dev.pandas.io/docs/whatsnew/v1.0.0.html , the following is stated: \"It is recommended to first upgrade to pandas 0.25 and to ensure your code is working without warnings, before upgrading to pandas 1.0.\" As Superset is still on `0.24`, it makes sense to bump to `0.25` now, as `1.0` is currently nearing release.\r\n\r\nBumping required a small change in `superset.result_set.py` due to Pandas now being more explicit about timezones. The new logic in `0.25` caused the original datetimes to be shifted by the UTC offset, as they were interpreted as being UTC due to the missing tzinfo. I traced back the change to this PR:

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [x] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis PR aims to simplify and consolidate the use of z-index values (z-indices?) throughout the codebase. \r\n\r\nIn the main `stylesheets/less/variables.less`, there are a few semantic layers onto which you can place elements. Add more if you want, but try to keep it minimal. Think of them like layers in Illustrator similar. \r\n\r\nI found a handful of z-index values that appeared to make no difference, so I've removed them. This is the riskiest part of this PR, but for each of these, I poked around trying to find the element(s) in the UI and make sure that it looked the same before/after removing the value. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nn/a - everything should look identical, unless there's an instance of an element I missed that becomes obscured by being covered up.\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@williaster (some of the z-index values I removed were yours, according to git — I hope I didn't break anything you added for good reason)\r\n@mistercrunch (you probably have some context about these elements too, and can make sure I didn't do anything stupid)","created_at":"2020-01-17T23:41:01Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T02:48:27Z","closed_at":"2020-01-24T05:47:55Z","merged_at":"2020-01-24T05:47:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"a85df65f85134901124830d9787c7ac15b6413e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"williaster","id":4496521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTY1MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4496521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster","html_url":"https://github.com/williaster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/williaster/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1331560260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMxNTYwMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"6D53B9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"🏷️

list of exposed endpoints has gotten out of control, mostly due to the default FAB behavior to auto-generate and auto-expose lots of endpoints dynamically on all ModelViews, combined with the fact that we have lots of models, and sometimes multiple ModelViews per model.\r\n\r\nThis PR disables ~300 endpoints out of ~500+ we currently have.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a fairly thorough pass on all ModelViews disabling endpoints that are not used. The focus has been on ModelViews, and generally only enabling what is needed (either the CRUD and/or the REST endpoints).  In many cases, I used either logic, my personal understanding of how models should be exposes, and simple `grep` commands to confirm assumptions. \r\n\r\nCommand to list the active endpoints\r\n```sh\r\necho \"print('\\n'.join(sorted([str(o) for o in app.url_map.iter_rules()])))\" | flask shell\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that longer term, we want to disable all ModelView REST endpoints and favor of FAB's newer `RestModelView`.  We also want to move away from the FAB's MVC / jinja CRUD, meaning we'll be deprecating all ModelViews.","created_at":"2020-01-13T22:16:03Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T02:48:17Z","closed_at":"2020-01-23T16:25:16Z","merged_at":"2020-01-23T16:25:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"315a11dfe265c6a20ed014610eb7351966292c38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":718573661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MTg1NzM2NjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/need:more-info","name":"need:more-info","color":"fff3b1","default":false,"description":"Requires
