**Issue: Excessive Logging in HBase Shell**\r\n\r\nWhile launching the HBase shell, we encountered excessive logging in the console output. This was primarily due to two specific logging configurations being set to `INFO` mode, which caused a high volume of unnecessary logs, making it difficult for users to focus on important output.\r\n\r\n### **Fix: Adjust Logging Levels to `ERROR`**\r\n\r\nTo address this issue, I have modified the logging configuration for the HBase shell:\r\n\r\n- Changed the logging levels for the two problematic configurations from `INFO` to `ERROR`.\r\n- This adjustment ensures that only critical error messages are logged, reducing log noise and improving the overall user experience when interacting with the HBase shell.\r\n\r\n### **Impact**\r\n\r\n- The fix significantly reduces unnecessary log output, providing a cleaner and more focused console experience.\r\n- No functionality of the HBase shell is impacted; the change only affects logging verbosity.\r\n\r\n### **Testing**\r\n\r\n- Verified that after the changes, only error-level messages are logged when opening and interacting with the HBase shell.\r\n- Ensured that important error messages are still captured without being overwhelmed by less relevant

**Issue: Excessive Logging in HBase Shell**\r\n\r\nWhile launching the HBase shell, we encountered excessive logging in the console output. This was primarily due to two specific logging configurations being set to `INFO` mode, which caused a high volume of unnecessary logs, making it difficult for users to focus on important output.\r\n\r\n### **Fix: Adjust Logging Levels to `ERROR`**\r\n\r\nTo address this issue, I have modified the logging configuration for the HBase shell:\r\n\r\n- Changed the logging levels for the two problematic configurations from `INFO` to `ERROR`.\r\n- This adjustment ensures that only critical error messages are logged, reducing log noise and improving the overall user experience when interacting with the HBase shell.\r\n\r\n### **Impact**\r\n\r\n- The fix significantly reduces unnecessary log output, providing a cleaner and more focused console experience.\r\n- No functionality of the HBase shell is impacted; the change only affects logging verbosity.\r\n\r\n### **Testing**\r\n\r\n- Verified that after the changes, only error-level messages are logged when opening and interacting with the HBase shell.\r\n- Ensured that important error messages are still captured without being overwhelmed by less relevant

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Hive startup parameters in Ambari do not include the `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions` flag. This omission causes errors when using the G1 garbage collector, preventing Hive from starting successfully. To resolve this issue, we propose adding the missing flag to the HADOOP_OPTS environment variable.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1. The `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions` flag is required for certain G1 GC optimizations.\r\n2. Without this flag, Hive fails to start when configured to use the G1 garbage collector.\r\n3. This change ensures compatibility with G1 GC and prevents startup failures.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual test and CI \r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. Ex: unit tests, manual tests)\r\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screen-shot; otherwise, remove this)\r\n\r\nPlease review [Ambari Contributing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe configuration in Ambari Hive:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<property>\r\n  <name>hive.load.data.owner</name>\r\n  <value>hive</value>\r\n  <on-ambari-upgrade add=\"false\"/>\r\n</property>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis setting causes permission errors when users attempt to load data. The only solution is to remove this configuration, but Ambari's web interface doesn't allow direct removal of configurations. As a result, users are forced to delete this configuration from the database using scripts, which is cumbersome.\r\n\r\nTo address this issue, we propose removing this configuration by default. Users who require this setting can still add it manually through custom configurations if needed.\r\n\r\nThis change will:\r\n1. Eliminate permission errors during data loading\r\n2. Reduce the need for manual database interventions\r\n3. Provide flexibility for users who may still need this configuration\r\n4. Improve overall user experience and reduce support requests related to this issue\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual test and ci\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. Ex: unit tests, manual tests)\r\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screen-shot; otherwise, remove this)\r\n\r\nPlease review [Ambari Contributing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWith the arrival of the `ambari-web` upgrade PR: #3770 , `PhantomJS` is no longer sufficient to support future testing tasks, as its support for ES5 has been abandoned([#14506](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/14506), [#14458](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/14458)). The `chromium-browser` will provide ES5 syntax support and enable testing for more libraries. This will be one of the foundational steps in the overall `ambari-web` upgrade plan.\r\n\r\nThis PR will be divided into two modules: `ambari-web` and `ambari-admin`. PhantomJS will be completely removed, and some failing tests will be fixed.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ mvn -T 2C -am test -pl ambari-web -Dmaven.artifact.threads=10 -Drat.skip\r\n$ mvn -T 2C -am test -pl ambari-admin -Dmaven.artifact.threads=10

incorrect Chromium setup shell commands in Jenkins. Removing these commands and adding PhantomJS configurations compatible with Ubuntu 22 resolved the issue. These configuration fixes have already been implemented in the Ambari Jenkins backend.\r\n\r\nThe CI/CD failure in this PR is caused by a previous PR that fixed a WebSocket leak https://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3783. I have contacted the original contributor and requested them to submit a PR to address the CI/CD failure caused by their code changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn a production environment, a modification to the operating system's security settings caused the run function in Ambari shell scripts to fail when switching users. This failure results in all components being unable to execute any operational commands (e.g., start, restart), and the lack of exception logging makes it difficult to diagnose the issue. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds detailed exception logging for failed user switch operations to aid in troubleshooting and resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Please fill in changes proposed in this fix)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual test in production environment\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n![微信图片_20240703154812](https://github.com/apache/ambari/assets/2969606/ed613094-836b-475b-a75d-c7ace0fec420)\r\n\r\nHere is how I reproduce the problem:\r\n1. Click Remote Cluster, Then click Add button to create a new cluster in Ambari.\r\n2. Modify the remote cluster name from MyRemoteCluster to NewRemoteCluster. \r\n3. After I updated the cluster name, I clicked the deregister remote cluster button and found no response on the page. \r\n4. When I refreshed the page, the cluster I added was still there. So I conclude that this is a bug for remote clusters.\r\n\r\nHere is my ideas for solving the problem:\r\nWhen I updated the name of the remote cluster, the database was updated. For some reason, the JPA cache was not updated, but the query interface directly looked up the database, so there was no problem. \r\nWhen I delete the data in the cache and delete it in the database, I find that the data in the cache is inconsistent with the database, so the deletion fails.\r\nIn the end, I achieved consistency between the cached data and the database after the update by deleting the cache before the update. The natural problem has also been solved.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. Ex: unit tests, manual tests)\r\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screen-shot; otherwise, remove this)\r\n\r\nPlease review [Ambari Contributing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDuring the adaptation process of Ambari for Ubuntu 22, encountered a type error with Ambari trunk reader while installing deb pkg and  collections.Mapping error\r\n\r\n\r\n1.in Python 3, collections.Mapping has been moved. The correct import path is now collections.abc.Mapping. \r\n2.Because all subprocess child processes have universal_newlines=True, all outputs are strings. However, os.read returns bytes, so str_buffer += data_chunk will result in an error.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. Ex: unit tests, manual tests)\r\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screen-shot; otherwise, remove this)\r\n\r\nPlease review [Ambari Contributing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn day-to-day operations, 99% of changes usually occur under the Ambari Stack rather than the Ambari Server itself. In such circumstances, using MPack to solely update the stack's content becomes highly essential. For instance, when updating the Ambari service code in an already existing environment, like the management code for the HDFS service, there's no need for manual distribution or synchronization, just package it into an MPack for the update. While MPacks are convenient, manually packaging an MPack can be cumbersome, hence a tool is proposed to automate the packaging of existing services into an MPack.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual test\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/ambari/assets/18082602/eb260fda-dfac-4c0d-aeef-0f45278d4c4c)\r\n\r\nafter install the stack mpack ,all service linked to the installed mpack\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/ambari/assets/18082602/000a667d-d1b7-46e0-90bf-1e352a3038b2)\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMain logic and changes of the commit:\r\n\r\nDesc:\r\n\r\nAmbari Ranger adaptation\r\nAmbari 2.8 uses bigtopstack 3.2.0, which corresponds to apache bigtop version 3.2.0\r\n\r\n1.All components lack corresponding ranger property files. Therefore, all ranger-related configuration files for all components are added.\r\n\r\n2.There is a lack of ranger integration, and here we integrate the ranger service. This ranger service is ported from hdp3.1.5's ranger service. The difference is that some initialization content in the install method is referenced to the /usr/bigtop/current directory, but this directory will only be linked with the \"bigtop-select distro-select set component version\" command in the post-hook after the install method is completed. Therefore, the initialization logic in the install method is moved to the configure method, and a mark file is set. Once the initialization is completed, a mark file is generated, and subsequent initialization will not be performed if the mark file exists.\r\n\r\n3. Bug fix for ranger advisor not working\r\nAfter integrating Ranger, most of the component advisors were not functioning properly due to the presence of ambari/ambari-server/src/main/resources/stacks/BIGTOP/3.2.0/services/stack_advisor.py in the 2.8.0 branch.\r\nThe working logic of stack_advisor is such that ambari/ambari-server/src/main/resources/scripts/stack_advisor.py, as the starting point, loads all advisors, including stack_advisor.py and service_advisor.py under ambari/ambari-server/src/main/resources/stacks directory.\r\nservice_advisor.py loads all service_advisor.py under each component directory and retrieves the recommended configuration, such as ambari/ambari-server/src/main/resources/stacks/BIGTOP/3.2.0/services/HDFS/service_advisor.py, which contains all recommended HDFS configurations.\r\nHowever, in the 2.8.0 branch, ambari/ambari-server/src/main/resources/stacks/BIGTOP/3.2.0/services/stack_advisor.py hardcodes to only return a few service advisors, causing all other component service advisors to not work properly.\r\nFurthermore, ambari/ambari-server/src/main/resources/stacks/BIGTOP/3.2.0/services/stack_advisor.py is redundant, and the configurations are scattered in each service advisor. Therefore, removing this file fixed the issue. The fix can be found in this PR: https://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3677.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual test\r\nbefore enable kerberos all compoent works smoonthly\r\n\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses a bug that was introduced after upgrading from Python 2 to Python 3. The original code was using byte strings for socket communication, which is the default string type in Python 2. However, in Python 3, strings are Unicode by default and need to be explicitly encoded to byte strings before being sent over a socket. Similarly, received data must be decoded back into a Unicode string. The changes in this PR ensure that the socket_command is properly encoded before sending and the received data is decoded back into a string for further processing. This fix restores proper socket communication functionality under Python 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Please fill in changes proposed in this fix)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nunit test\r\nmanual test\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested.
