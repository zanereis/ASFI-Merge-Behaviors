Description\r\nAdd action versioning feature for actions\r\n\r\n## Design\r\nDesign document: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OPENWHISK/Action+Versioning\r\n\r\nNewly created/updated actions will include a `version` in their document id, like `whisk.system/hello@0.0.2`, so they will not replace old versions.\r\n\r\nAnd to be compatible with current actions whose id doesn't contain `version` info, I added a new view `action-versions` in CouchDB which can use action's fullyQualifiedName to get all its versions and related ids, and it will return the default version of the action when `includeDocs=true`, so with one query request, system can get the default version(optional) and version-ids mappings for an action:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction (doc) {\r\n  var isAction = function (doc) { return (doc.exec !== undefined) };\r\n  if (isAction(doc)) try {\r\n    var value = {\r\n      _id: doc.namespace + \"/\" + doc.name + \"/default\",\r\n      namespace: doc.namespace,\r\n      name: doc.name,\r\n      version: doc.version,\r\n      docId: doc._id\r\n    };\r\n    emit([doc.namespace + \"/\" + doc.name], value);\r\n  } catch (e) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n~There is a new annotation field `publish` for action, action owners can set it to false for test-only purpose to make sure users can not get/invoke non-published versions, and set it to true when action is well developed~\r\n\r\nBefore update/get/invoke/delete an action, this view will be queried first to get the docId of action, and then using the docId to fetch action from database:\r\n\r\n- create/update:\r\n 1. if `defaultVersion` is passed and is a valid `SemVer`, system won't create a new action but just create/update the default version entry for this action with `$fullyqualifiedName(false)/default` as docId. if `defaultVersion` is not passed, goto step2\r\n 2. system will query `action-versions` view, and if version count exceed max allowed value, reject request. if not exceed, goto step3\r\n 3. get a suitable docid to update, if default version is set before, return default version's id, else, return latest version's id, goto step4; if no version exist at all, return None, goto step5.\r\n 4. create a new action based on old action got in step3 and user's input, with `version = version.upPatch`\r\n 5. create a new action based on user's input, with `version=0.0.1`\r\n\r\n- get:\r\n 1. if `showVersions` is true, return versions list of the action, else, goto step2:\r\n    ```scala\r\n    case class WhiskActionVersionList(namespace: EntityPath,\r\n                                      name: EntityName,\r\n                                      versionMappings: Map[SemVer, DocId],\r\n                                      defaultVersion: Option[SemVer])\r\n    ```\r\n 2. get docId for the given action'name and version parameter, if `version` is not provided, the default or latest version(when default version is not set) will be choosed, then fetch action using this docId\r\n\r\n- invoke:\r\n 1. get docId for the given action'name and version parameter, if no `version` is specified, the default or latest version will be choosed\r\n 2. pass the docId to `ActivationMessage`\r\n 3. invoker can get action using docId passed with `ActivationMessage` directly, so it doesn't need to care about how to transform version to docId\r\n\r\n- delete:\r\n 1. if `version` is provided, delete related version, else, goto step2\r\n 2. get version list of action using design doc `action-versions`, goto step3\r\n 3. if there are multiple versions exist and `deleteAll=false`, reject request, else goto step4\r\n 4. delete all versions, and return the latest version of action\r\n\r\nWith this view, the old style of docId for actions is also compatible with this PR\r\n\r\nAnd for performance reason, there is a cache layer for querying this view from database\r\n\r\nOther than actions, there is also some tiny changes to `trigger` and `rule`, since in current master, `trigger`, `rule` and `action` can not using same name by follow same docId style, while with this PR, actions will use a different way for their docId(`name + version`), so triggers and rules may use same name with some actions.\r\n\r\nSo before save `trigger` and `rule`, it will also fetch the `action-versions` view first, and if there are some docIds returned, which means that entity name is occupied, openwhisk should return a `Conflict` error with message `Resource by this name exists but is not in this collection.`\r\n\r\n##

ElasticSearch.\r\nWith a new scheduler, it is important to decide when and how many containers to add.\r\nThe scheduler will calculate the average duration for the recent N activations and compute the processing power of one container, e.g. how many activations can be handled by one container in a given time. Factoring in the average duration, the number of incoming activations, and the number of activations in a queue, the scheduler can add more containers to handle the given activations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#4922)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\nIf want to deploy two helm release openwhisk cluster,  when the second helm release cluster's invokerN pod is restarting, it will delete the first helm release's invokerN runtime pods.\r\n\r\nBecause when invokerN pod is starting, it will delete  runtime pods with label(invoker=invokerN) only. e.g.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/master/core/invoker/src/main/scala/org/apache/openwhisk/core/containerpool/kubernetes/KubernetesContainerFactory.scala#L65\r\n\r\nin order to avoid `delete other helm release invokerN's runtime pod`, it is better to add helm release to invoker pod, and when invoker pod is starting, add label(release=xxxxxx) together with label(invoker=invokerN) to delete runtime pods.\r\n\r\nAnother brother pr: https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-deploy-kube/pull/639\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this change is essentially that some activations trigger the creation of new containers, which has the potentially to be a very long operation depending (e.g., if the creation of the container triggered a scale-up in cluster size), and OpenWhisk will block (with respect to that activation) until the container is created. This is not ideal since oftentimes, other containers become free and ready to service the request in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThis change:\r\n* Immediately moves cold start containers into the busy queue and waits for them to send `NeedWork` to the `ContainerPool` (this means that the activation will run on the next available container that can service the request)\r\n* Adds a `PreRun` event that is sent to the container to tell it how to initialize\r\n\r\n### Current Issues\r\nThis doesn't currently pass all the tests, but I suspect I'm at the limit of what I can do here (as I don't have lots of other context around the codebase and the project overall).\r\n\r\n* There feels like a weird parallel-but-not-quite pathway between prewarm and cold-start containers now (since now, both have an initialization step, but the prewarm has the stem-cell-differentiation step as well). It would be nice to simplify that if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Quick note on my terminology, since I think I understand how these words are used, but want to make sure:\r\n> * action = \"specification for how to handle a request\" (eg, using blackbox image or nodejs runtime)\r\n> * activation = \"specific request that is handled by an action\"\r\n\r\nThe run buffer only considers the current head of the run queue (for activations that couldn't be immediately sent to containers), which is not ideal. Imagine this scenario:\r\n* Run A (using image 1) triggers a cold start, A is enqueued on the run buffer\r\n* Run B (using image 2) triggers a cold start, B is enqueued on the run buffer (position 1)\r\n* Container 2 finishes initialization (maybe it didn't require pulling an image while image 1 did have to be pulled)\r\n* The ContainerPool gets `NeedWork` from container 2, moves container 2 into the free pool, triggers `processBufferOrFeed()`\r\n* `processBufferOrFeed` re-sends the first run on the buffer, which is run A\r\n* There are no containers available to service run A (since it's still initializing)\r\n* Run A is re-enqueued and nothing else happens (even though run B could have been serviced)\r\n* Container 1 finishes initializing, sends `NeedWork`\r\n* Run A is de-queued again, and now handled\r\n* Run B is never actually handled???\r\n\r\nOne solution to this might be to add another layer between ContainerPool and ContainerProxy which would be something like `ActionPool`. The `ActionPool` would handle the creation of new containers and serving requests in the order in which they're received, but that gets messy when you need to restrict the total size of the ContainerPool (and it's also messy when there are resource contention issues - what happens when two different actions want to scale up the number of containers but the container pool is at the max size? right now, it would attempt to reap some old containers to service the next activation, so it's fair with respect to activation order). \r\n\r\nA (potentially simpler) solution might just be to have per-action buffers, so when you get a `NeedWork` corresponding to action 1, dequeue from that specific buffer.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n#4974 \r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nFixes deserialization issue for new instance id format for upgrades of live services that cannot have downtime.  Fix will provide upgrade path to upgrade controllers and invokers safely.\r\n\r\n1. When upgrading the invokers to latest, the `ControllerInstanceId` in `ActivationMessage` fails to deserialize because the `instanceType` is not included in the message sent from the non-upgraded controllers.\r\n2. Vice versa controllers fail to upgrade if invokers have not been upgraded yet because the completion messages can not deserialize in the controller because the invokers aren't including `instanceType`.\r\n3. The fix here fixes case 1 so that `ControllerInstanceId` will still deserialize if `instanceType` is not included.\r\n4. Upgrade all invokers in your cluster, wait a few minutes so all completed topics are consuming post upgrade messages that now include `instanceType`\r\n5. Upgrade controllers safely because invokers are now upgraded with the newly formatted messages.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change

PR provides a MongoDBArtifactStore implementation to enable using MongoDB for storing subjects, whisks and activation in [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)， and mostly comes from old PR: https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/3570.\r\n\r\nSince lots of codes are inspired by https://github.com/chetanmeh/openwhisk-mongo, so I added @chetanmeh as co-author\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nSome users may want to use other database backends instead of CouchDB to store entities, this PR provides MongoDB as an alternative choice for these users\r\n\r\nA simple document here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OPENWHISK/MongoDB+Artifact+Store\r\n\r\n\r\n## MongoDB driver\r\nMongoDB provides [official drivers](https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/) for many languages, in this case, we pick the [mongo-scala-driver](http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-scala-driver/2.2/), this driver provides an idiomatic Scala API that is built on top of the MongoDB Async Java driver.\r\n\r\n## Design Considerations\r\n### Data Model\r\nThe data scheme in MongoDB is just like CouchDB except that MongoDB doesn't have a `_rev` field, below is the data of `whisk.system/invokerHealthTestAction0` in CouchDB and MongoDB:\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>CouchDB</td>\r\n<td>MongoDB</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<pre>\r\n{\r\n  \"_id\": \"whisk.system/invokerHealthTestAction0\",\r\n  \"_rev\": \"68-e72440f911c64ab11441c09e730e5ab8\",\r\n  \"name\": \"invokerHealthTestAction0\",\r\n  \"publish\": false,\r\n  \"annotations\": [],\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"updated\": 1524476933182,\r\n  \"entityType\": \"action\",\r\n  \"exec\": {\r\n    \"kind\": \"nodejs:6\",\r\n    \"code\": \"function main(params) { return params; }\",\r\n    \"binary\": false\r\n  },\r\n  \"parameters\": [],\r\n  \"limits\": {\r\n    \"timeout\": 60000,\r\n    \"memory\": 256,\r\n    \"logs\": 10\r\n  },\r\n  \"namespace\": \"whisk.system\"\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<pre>\r\n{\r\n  \"_id\" : \"whisk.system/invokerHealthTestAction0\",\r\n  \"name\" : \"invokerHealthTestAction0\",\r\n  \"publish\" : false,\r\n  \"annotations\" : \"[ ]\",\r\n  \"version\" : \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"updated\" : NumberLong(\"1524473794826\"),\r\n  \"entityType\" : \"action\",\r\n  \"exec\" : {\r\n    \"kind\" : \"nodejs:6\",\r\n    \"code\" : \"function main(params) { return params; }\",\r\n    \"binary\" : false\r\n  },\r\n  \"parameters\" : \"[ ]\",\r\n  \"limits\" : {\r\n    \"timeout\" : 60000,\r\n    \"memory\" : 256,\r\n    \"logs\" : 10\r\n  },\r\n  \"namespace\" : \"whisk.system\"\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n- *Since the `annotations` and `parameters` fields may using arbitrary strcut and MongoDB doesn't support `$` as the first char for field name, so it will convert these two fields to string, and convert it back when get them via openwhisk, this is transparent to users*\r\n- *`_rev` field will not be generated automatically in MongoDB, so it is calculted and inserted in code explicitly*\r\n\r\n### Attachment\r\nMongoDB use [GridFS](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/gridfs/index.html) to store and retrieve files that exceed the BSON-document size limit of 16 MB.\r\n\r\nAttachment in MongoDB is stored in a separate collection with a independent `_id`, this PR use the `doc._id + doc.file_name` as the attachment's `_id` field, then we can find the relative attachment easily.\r\n\r\n## Progress\r\n\r\n### Finished Work\r\n- [x] Basic Usage(create、update、query、delete)\r\n- [x] Attachment Support\r\n- [x] Automated deployment of MongoDB using Ansible\r\n- [x] CI Integration\r\n- [x] Documents\r\n\r\n### FurtherWork\r\n- [ ] Add MongoDB support for wskadmin\r\n- [ ] Support batch insert\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n- [x] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [x] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [x] Enhancement or new feature (adds new functionality).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I signed an [Apache CLA](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n- [x] I reviewed the [style guides](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/wiki/Contributing:-Git-guidelines#code-readiness) and followed the recommendations (Travis CI will check :).\r\n- [x] I added tests to cover my changes.\r\n- [ ] My changes require further changes to the documentation.\r\n- [x] I updated the documentation where necessary.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-04T09:59:18Z","updated_at":"2024-10-23T13:46:05Z","closed_at":"2021-06-09T00:54:27Z","merged_at":"2021-06-09T00:54:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"927962692e45fc7276ccb7902fd3a111daa54885","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"KeonHee","id":16450962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDUwOTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16450962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeonHee","html_url":"https://github.com/KeonHee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeonHee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeonHee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeonHee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeonHee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeonHee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeonHee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeonHee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeonHee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KeonHee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/pulls/4963/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/pulls/4963/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4963/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/statuses/d62917ddad6e7bbb78c073cd47f594b6ea80e6fd","head":{"label":"jiangpengcheng:implement_mongodb_artifact_store","ref":"implement_mongodb_artifact_store","sha":"d62917ddad6e7bbb78c073cd47f594b6ea80e6fd","user":{"login":"jiangpengcheng","id":1858477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTg0Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1858477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangpengcheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":118415951,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTg0MTU5NTE=","name":"incubator-openwhisk","full_name":"jiangpengcheng/incubator-openwhisk","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangpengcheng","id":1858477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTg0Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1858477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangpengcheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangpengcheng/incubator-openwhisk","description":"Apache

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nCurrent behavior is that exception from the api call to create a pod, does NOT attempt to delete the pod that was just referenced. Original thought was that if the api call was unsuccessful, there would be nothing to cleanup. But we've seen other cases where the api call fails, and yet the pod is still created (and therefore becomes orphaned). \r\n\r\nWith this PR, on an error from kubernetes api server (whether a response error, or some exception from fabric8 client, doesn't matter), now we attempt to delete the pod which may or may not have been created. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

is a sister to #4938 to improve failure handling cases for:\r\n- concurrency enabled actions\r\n- cold start container failures\r\n\r\n<!--- Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nIn a previous PR #4938 we changed the behavior where\r\n- concurrency enabled actions\r\n- init failure occurs\r\n\r\nso that any queued activations at the ContainerProxy (because the action supports concurrency), will be aborted if /init fails.\r\n\r\nThis PR, extends that same behavior to the case where cold start of a container fails.\r\n\r\nIn both cases (/init fails, cold start for the container fails), we assume that a failure will not resolve by retry of the activation(s). That won't always be true (a transient issue with docker registry), but in our experience it usually true (an invalid image, or inability to launch containers for some longer amount of time than will be resolved in 60s).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nWhen you sent the controller a malformed query string it would incorrectly return a 500 error, on top of that it wouldn't even log things properly. This adds some simple defensive code to prevent both issues.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -v \"http://<controller_ip>:<controller_port>/?p=%2\"\r\n```\r\nWould result in a 500 error from the controller. \r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

code for concurrency tracking in sharding loadbalancer.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nWe saw some cases where controller ack processing was incomplete for some activations, which turned out to be:\r\n* cluster state change would reset the concurrency tracking (for concurrent activations, -c > 1)\r\n* the concurrency tracking logic did not tolerate the resets, which happen several times for each cluster state change\r\n* the ack message processing would fail silently\r\n\r\nThis PR does 2 things:\r\n* add defensive code to the concurrency tracking logic (to tolerate these state resets during cluster state changes)\r\n* add extra logging to message processing to increase visibility of failed message handling\r\n\r\nThis was not caught in tests due to the multi-controller cluster state changes, plus concurrency, required to reproduce the symptom.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to

create debian based images.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nSome infrastructure components in our operations have trouble with Alpine images, so we need to be able to use some other base image, e.g. Debian.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows creation of debian (or other) based images for controller, invoker, etc by\r\n* adding additional Dockerfiles named with a suffix e.g. `Dockerfile-debian` \r\n* using a gradle property to enable use of alternate Dockerfiles by suffix`-PdockerfileSuffix=\"-debian\"`\r\n* use default (`Dockerfile`) if no suffix specified, or not available for that module\r\n\r\nThere may be a better way to do some of this (e.g. use a different base image, and use build args or a multi stage build), but when some commands (e.g. user management) vary by distribution, it is simpler to just have a different Dockerfile.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this

appears to have an incorrect description of how the deploy process works when it's a zip file.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nI'm not super familiar with OpenWhisk yet, but from tinkering with IBM Cloud Functions, and doing deploys involving both raw source code files and zip archives, this description in the readme doesn't sound accurate. I think what it was meant to say was that the zip archive would have either an executable or one or more Go source code files.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (generally a non-breaking change which closes an issue).\r\n- [ ] Enhancement or new feature (adds new functionality).\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (a bug fix or enhancement which changes existing behavior).\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [x] I signed an [Apache CLA](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n- [x] I reviewed the [style guides](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/wiki/Contributing:-Git-guidelines#code-readiness) and followed the recommendations (Travis CI will check :).\r\n- [ ] I added tests to cover my changes.\r\n- [ ] My changes require further changes to the documentation.\r\n- [x] I updated the documentation where necessary.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-22T19:36:06Z","updated_at":"2020-08-25T04:56:59Z","closed_at":"2020-08-24T17:18:21Z","merged_at":"2020-08-24T17:18:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"433376a7963ff60724611776e4745ebc0d913117","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/pulls/4947/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/pulls/4947/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4947/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/statuses/af59eecc87207e9786a0e097ab29d5e424e994a8","head":{"label":"mattwelke:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"af59eecc87207e9786a0e097ab29d5e424e994a8","user":{"login":"mattwelke","id":7719209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTkyMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7719209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwelke","html_url":"https://github.com/mattwelke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwelke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwelke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwelke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwelke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwelke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwelke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwelke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwelke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattwelke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"df2c49970e804dfa64b55d54cebf85f394d934ea","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52039373,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjAzOTM3Mw==","name":"openwhisk","full_name":"apache/openwhisk","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk","description":"Apache

Description\r\nAdds a force parameter to the delete package api so any actions in the package are deleted with it before confirming and deleting the package. If force is not set (by default), it still returns the same error of needing to delete the actions first before deleting the package. \r\n\r\nI could use some help on optimizing the package deletion because currently I need to do a get action list to get the list of actions in the package to check if it's non-empty which was already a part of the route, and then I have to do a get on the actions to get the revision id before I can delete the action. I don't think this is too much of an issue because normal action deletes have to do this get then delete anyways I believe. Any advice here would be appreciated because of my lack of familiarity with the code. It does work as is though currently.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#1824)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [x] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

if passing another annotations, original previous annotation\r\nwill be removed and the passed new annotations will be added.\r\n\r\nIt may give users some confused that why my previous annotation gone.\r\nSo it is better to not delete user's previous annotation when adding new\r\nannotation, but at the same time, need to provide a feature that\r\nsupport to delete annotation by user via ClI, e.g.\r\n```\r\nwsk action update hello --del-annotation key1\r\n```\r\n\r\nCLI side needs to support as well in this pr: \r\n* https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-cli/pull/488\r\n* https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-client-go/pull/137\r\n\r\nAfter all above 3 prs merged, supported\r\n* when update action with new annotation, the previous old annotation will not be deleted\r\n* if want to delete some annotations, user can execute below command via CLI\r\n \r\n  ```\r\n  wsk action update $action -del-annotation key1  -del-annotation key2\r\n  ```\r\n  support pass multiple

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nCurrently there are some cases that are not handled in ContainerProxy for concurrent activation processing:\r\nWith multiple in flight, if one fails, ContainerProxy may stop immediately, causing dead letters and forced ack at controller.\r\n\r\nFailures may look slightly different depending on how the action fails:\r\n* intermittent failures behave one way (some success, some, failures at response of POST /run to action container - e.g. sometimes return an empty promise from action)\r\n* terminal failures behave a different way (e.g. nodejs process crashes in action container a la `process.exit()`)\r\n\r\nTo handle these, ContainerProxy needs to check `activeCount` tracking variable to determine if any addition activations are in-flight when an error occurs, and behave accordingly.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nIf a namespace is in `ignore-namespace` configuration, user-events service still sends activation metrics though they are not incremented in case of counter or not updated in case of the histogram. Even though the value of metrics is not updated, it still creates a large amount of time series in case of canary service or load is creating unique actions and eventually can cause high cardinality. \r\n  \r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [x] Monitoring\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nIn a previous PR, I attempted to introduce exception handling for when the kubernetes client call `kubeRestClient.pods.inNamespace(namespace).create(pod)` directly throws an exception using logic like:\r\n```\r\ntry {\r\n      kubeRestClient.pods.inNamespace(namespace).create(pod)\r\n      ...\r\n    } catch {\r\n      case e: Throwable =>\r\n        throw e\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nBut this doesn't return a Future.failed as desired for handling in `KubernetesContainer.create`, rather it just exits the `create()` function, and the activation is never completed with the failure information.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses that by capturing the exception via `Try` and explicitly returning an appropriate `Future.failed`. \r\nAlso added tests for this exception handling, and exception handling around timeout while waiting for pod to become ready. \r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\nWhen enabling reactive prewarm configs, if batches of prewarms are removed at the same time across invokers, we end up with a herd of container deletion and creation at the same time, especially if invokers startup at the same time.  This can cause scheduling challenges particularly in mesos or kubernetes. Given that these prewarm containers are not in use, we should try to alleviate any extra issues the prewarm state changes may cause, and allow them to linger slightly longer, if there is a benefit to the scheduling system. \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

feature.\r\n\r\nfor master branch,  if invoker has `16GB` physical memory, currently, if we configure 12GB user memory and 5GB prewarm pool, invokers will try to create containers up to 17GB memory and it may will end up with OOM.\r\n\r\nAfter apply this feature, user just configure invoker memory to a precise value:  `16GB` , when  reaches `16GB`, it will not create container any more, this can avoid `OOM`\r\n\r\nThis has another benefit that make user must calculate the prewarmed container's memory carefully, and configure the invoker memory more accurately\r\n```\r\n\"CONFIG_whisk_containerPool_userMemory\": \"{{ hostvars[groups['invokers'][invoker_index | int]].user_memory | default(invoker.userMemory) }}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related issue and

Description\r\nBy default activation responses can be 1MB in size and they will be truncated to 1MB in case the size is bigger. \r\nThis PR makes the truncation length configurable too. This means that the response size could be configured to 1MB for example, but the truncation length can be 512KB. \r\nThe reason for this change is the fact that once the response is truncated, it does not make a lot of sense to store the entire payload to the database. \r\n\r\nAs an example, for the following configuration:\r\n```\r\nwhisk {\r\n    activation {\r\n        payload {\r\n            max = 512\r\n            truncation = 10\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nthe response of a truncated activation result will have the following format:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"error\": \"The action produced a response that exceeded the allowed length: 600 > 512 bytes. The truncated response was: {\\\"body\\\":\\\"H\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand the database will store only 10 bytes of the response. \r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [x] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR creates a limits api that will return the limits set for the namespace.\r\n\r\n/namespaces/_/limits\r\n\r\nIn the future, it's extendable to return individual limits by entity such as \r\n\r\n/namespaces/_/limits/invocationsPerMinute\r\n\r\nalthough that is not implemented in this PR.\r\n\r\nOnly Get is supported as setting limits is an admin operation. This allows clients to see what their namespace's limits are set to without going through an admin for the information. Also, since the route goes through the controller we can return the system defaults for invocationsPerMinute, concurrentInvocations, and firesPerMinute rather than just saying the system defaults apply if nothing is set in couchdb.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [x] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\nThe cosmosdb cache invalidator needs to be more defensive about downstream sdk errors like:\r\n* cosmosdb failures at startup\r\n* kafka producer failures during processing\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThese types of issues are most commonly related to configuration problems, so this refactoring mainly addresses these issues by exiting the application when these failure scenarios occur. \r\nDeployments should handle termination by restarting the application, but typically the configuration issues will not be resolvable until the configuration is repaired, and exiting the application is aimed to bring increased visibility to the configuration problems as they happen.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a

Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\nThis PR makes storing of blocking successful activations volatile. More on the reasoning behind this PR can be found in the issue #4881. This PR is also related to #4659. \r\n\r\n- Blocking successful `activations`, `sequences` and `compositions` won't be stored in the database in case the environment has `whisk.activation.disable-store-result` configuration variable set to `true`. \r\n\r\n- Non-blocking or unsuccessful `activations`,`sequences` and `compositions` are not affected, and will continue to be stored in the database.\r\n\r\n- User-events monitoring is not affected. All activations, including blocking successful will be tracked. \r\n\r\n- Logs will continue to be accessible in case external logging services are configured. \r\nWe'll first try to get the activation record from the database, in case no record has been found we'll still try to get the logs using the activation Id provided in the call. \r\nOne concern was around security. The existing implementations in both `ElasticSearchLogStore` and `SplunkLogStore` only used the `activation_id` to query for the logs. In order to make sure that one tenant can't access other tenant's logs, we have changed the implementation to use both the `namespace` and the `activation_id` for the log store search. \r\n\r\n- Blocking successful activations can still be stored in case the `X-OW-EXTRA-LOGGING` header is set to `on` when making the invocation. \r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#4881)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nThis patch fixes a bug whereby webactions cannot respond to OPTIONS even for default CORS responses because the handler check for authentication first, before checking if the requests if an OPTIONS request.\r\n\r\nActions that opts for the default response are not affected - they are only invoked if the request is not an OPTIONS request as before. Actions which respond to OPTIONS explicitly will be invoked even if not authenticated yet but this should be acceptable since the action cannot respond to OPTIONS otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#4879)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

and how your changes are tested. -->\r\nAs we already know, when invoker starts up, will create some prewarmed containers in prewarmedpool in advance.\r\n\r\nIf the prewarmed containers are not used for sometime, the prewarmed containers will exist forever.\r\nit may lead to `waste of resources`\r\n\r\nso there has need to provide some mechanism to save memory resources, e.g.\r\n* If the prewarmed containers are not used for sometime, should delete them automatically.\r\n* When cold start happened, we should supplement a prewarmed container which matched the kind/memory in runtime.\r\n\r\nNode: Current, i didn't add test cases, after some reviews, i will add it.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one.

PR extends @mcdan's work from #4756 to allow for per-namespace encryption keys.
