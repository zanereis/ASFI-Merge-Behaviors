What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to remove orphaned error class documents, include:\r\n1.Introducing an automated mechanism for removing orphaned files.\r\n2.Remove two orphaned error class documents:  `sql-error-conditions-incompatible-data-to-table-error-class.md` and `sql-error-conditions-unsupported-temp-view-operation-error-class.md`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Keep error documents clear.\r\n- There are two possibilities for generating orphaned error documents: \r\nThe first, when we are performing error class refactoring without deleting the error class document that has already been refactored; \r\nThe second, modify the error class name based on the suggestions submitted by the reviewer in code review, but unintentionally submit the previous error class document.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Manually test.\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-09-16T03:11:28Z","updated_at":"2023-09-18T02:26:04Z","closed_at":"2023-09-18T02:26:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1d13ebbe2dafeb3c656140dc4759b36778286a59","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42952/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42952/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42952/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d47d8b43382438bdfaeb53dbe9dfda37a6f73bee","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-45184","ref":"SPARK-45184","sha":"d47d8b43382438bdfaeb53dbe9dfda37a6f73bee","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n[SPARK-25342](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25342) Added a support for rolling back shuffle map stage so that all tasks of the stage can be retried when the stage output is indeterminate. This is done by clearing all map outputs at the time of stage submission. This approach workouts well except for this case:\r\n\r\nAssume both Shuffle 1 and 2 are indeterminate\r\n\r\nShuffleMapStage1 ––> Shuffle 1 ---–> ShuffleMapStage2 ----> Shuffle 2 ----> ResultStage\r\n\r\n- ShuffleMapStage1 is complete\r\n- A task from ShuffleMapStage2 fails with FetchFailed. Other tasks are still running\r\n- Both ShuffleMapStage1 and ShuffleMapStage2 are retried\r\n- ShuffleMapStage1 is retried and completes\r\n- ShuffleMapStage2 reattempt is scheduled for execution\r\n- Before all tasks of ShuffleMapStage2 reattempt could finish, one/more laggard tasks from the original attempt of ShuffleMapStage2 finish and ShuffleMapStage2 also gets marked as complete\r\n- Result Stage gets scheduled and finishes\r\n\r\nAfter this change, such laggard tasks from the old attempt of the indeterminate stage will be ignored \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis can give wrong result when indeterminate stages needs to be retried under the circumstances mentioned above\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd error logging into `addArtifact`  (see example in \"How this is tested\"). The logging code is moved into separate file to avoid circular dependency.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, in case `addArtifact` is executed with the file which doesn't exist, the user gets cryptic error\r\n\r\n```grpc._channel._InactiveRpcError: <_InactiveRpcError of RPC that terminated with:\r\n        status = StatusCode.UNKNOWN\r\n        details = \"Exception iterating requests!\"\r\n        debug_error_string = \"None\"\r\n>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is hard to debug without deep digging into the subject.\r\n\r\nThis happens because addArtifact is implemented as client-side streaming and the actual error happens during grpc consuming iterator generating requests. Unfortunately grpc doesn't print any debug information for user to understand the problem.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nAdditional logging which is opt-in same way as before with `SPARK_CONNECT_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> s.addArtifact(\"XYZ\", file=True)\r\n[New:] 2023-09-15 17:06:40,078 11789

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIncrease Numpy minimum version to 1.21\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- according to the [release history](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/#history), Numpy 1.15 was released about 5 years ago, while the last maintenance release in 1.21 was released 1 year ago;\r\n- with 1.21 as the minimum version, we can discard all version checking in PySpark;\r\n- `pandas==1.4.4` just depends on `numpy>=1.21.0`; \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to change the behavior when user runs streaming query with Trigger.AvailableNow, which query has any source which does not support Trigger.AvailableNow. Instead of using wrapper implementation, this PR proposes to fall back to execute a single batch (a.k.a Trigger.Once). \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new flag `spark.sql.streaming.triggerAvailableNowWrapper.enabled` to retain the behavior for advanced and extreme users. The flag is marked as internal since it's really only for extreme users who are concerned about behavioral change.\r\n\r\nMinor details would be following:\r\n\r\n* This PR does not use Trigger.Once, hence users won't see deprecation warning for Trigger.Once. \r\n* This PR will provide a warning log to inform the source(s) which doesn't support Trigger.AvailableNow, so that users can indicate which source(s) is/are preventing them to enjoy benefits of Trigger.AvailableNow.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe have observed a data duplication issue with 3rd party data source when it's used with Trigger.AvailableNow. The source didn't support Trigger.AvailableNow, and unfortunately is also not played well with wrapper implementation.\r\n\r\nWe care more about possible correctness issue than better coverage of Trigger.AvailableNow, hence want to stop using wrapper implementation by default. We also care about not breaking existing query, so fallback to single batch execution rather than failing the query.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this introduces a behavioral change for streaming query with Trigger.AvailableNow which contains any source not supporting Trigger.AvailableNow.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified UT.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-09-15T05:22:51Z","updated_at":"2023-09-21T01:58:34Z","closed_at":"2023-09-20T02:05:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"58056b03a7ea2f30dca07cdccf5ddcfcb44bb2b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to extend the proto protocol, and add two more fields to `SqlCommand`: `arguments` and `pos_arguments`. This should allow to construct arrays/maps/structs by the `map()`, `array()`, `struct()`, `map_from_arrays()` and `map_from_entries()`, and pass them to `sql()` as arguments.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the issue demonstrated by the example:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.sql(\"select element_at(?, 1)\", Array(array(lit(1)))).collect()\r\njava.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: literal unresolved_function {\r\n[info]   function_name: \"array\"\r\n[info]   arguments {\r\n[info]     literal {\r\n[info]       integer: 1\r\n[info]     }\r\n[info]   }\r\n[info] }\r\n[info]  not supported (yet).\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: The PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42752 supported constructors, and this PR extends the feature on Scala connect client.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy new checks:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *.ClientE2ETestSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPreviously the Python client would not call `release_all` after fetching all results and leaving the query dangling. The query would then be removed after the five minute timeout.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds proper testing for calling release all and release until.\r\n\r\nIn addition it fixes a test race condition where we would close the SparkSession which would in turn close the GRPC channel which might have dangling async release calls hanging.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nStabililty\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UT\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe main change of this pr as follows:\r\n1. Bump MiMa's `previousSparkVersion` to 3.5.0\r\n2. Clean up expired rules and case match\r\n    2.1. Remove  `v35excludes` and `case v if v.startsWith(\"3.5\")`\r\n    2.2. The target SPARK-43265, SPARK-44255, SPARK-44475, SPARK-44496 and SPARK-43997 are all Apache 3.5.0, clean up them from `defaultExcludes `,  \r\n    2.3. The targets of SPARK-44705 and SPARK-44198 are all Apache 4.0.0, move them to `v40excludes`\r\n4. Let `commonUtils` and `sqlApi` modules start participating in the mima check’ \r\n5. Increase the mem of mima check from 5120m to 5632m to avoid `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo ensure that MiMa checks cover new APIs added in Spark 3.5.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nScala 2.12\r\n\r\n```\r\ndev/mima

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to re-upgrade Scala to 2.13.11, after SPARK-45144 was merged, the build issues mentioned in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41943 should no longer exist.\r\n\r\n- https://www.scala-lang.org/news/2.13.11\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this pr adds a new suppression rule for warning message: `Implicit definition should have explicit type`, this is a new compile check introduced by https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10083, we must fix it when we upgrading to use Scala 3\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis release improves collections, adds support for JDK 20 and 21, adds support for JDK 17 `sealed`:\r\n- https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10363\r\n- https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10184\r\n- https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10397\r\n- https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10348\r\n- https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10105\r\n\r\nThere are 2 known issues in this version:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/12800\r\n- https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/12799\r\n\r\nFor the first one, there is no compilation warning messages related to `match may not be exhaustive` in Spark compile log, and for the second one, there is no case of `method.isAnnotationPresent(Deprecated.class)` in Spark code, there is just \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/8c84d2c9349d7b607db949c2e114df781f23e438/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/JavaTypeInference.scala#L130\r\n\r\nin Spark Code, and I checked `@javax.annotation.Nonnull` no this issue.\r\n\r\nSo I think These two issues will not affect Spark itself, but this doesn't mean it won't affect the code written by end users themselves\r\n\r\n\r\nThe full release notes as follows:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.13.11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this is a Scala version change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Existing Test\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pull request adds Encoders.bean support for beans having a superclass declared with generic type arguments. \r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass JavaBeanWithGenericsA<T> {\r\n    public T getPropertyA() {\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setPropertyA(T a) {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass JavaBeanWithGenericBase extends JavaBeanWithGenericsA<String> {\r\n}\r\n\r\nEncoders.bean(JavaBeanWithGenericBase.class); // Exception\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat feature had to be part of [PR 42327](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/1f5d78b5952fcc6c7d36d3338a5594070e3a62dd) but was missing as I was focusing on nested beans only (@hvanhovell )\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nJavaTypeInference.encoderFor did not solve TypeVariable objects for superclasses so when managing a case like in the example above an exception was thrown.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests have been extended, new specific tests have been added\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n@hvanhovell this is branch-3.4 port of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR re-enables Encoders.bean to be called against beans having read-only properties, that is properties that have only getters and no setter method. Beans with read only properties are even used in internal tests.\r\nSetter methods of a Java bean encoder are stored within an Option wrapper because they are missing in case of read-only properties. When a java bean has to be initialized, setter methods for the bean properties have to be called: this PR filters out read-only properties from that process.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes are required to avoid an exception to the thrown by getting the value of a None option object.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAn additional regression test has been added\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n@hvanhovell this is 3.4 branch port

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to rebalance the tests for `pyspark-pandas-connect-part1`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe rebalance the CI by splitting slow tests into multiple parts, but `pyspark-pandas-connect-part1` takes almost an hour than other splitted `pyspark-pandas-connect-partx` tests as below:\r\n\r\n|pyspark-pandas-connect-part0|pyspark-pandas-connect-part1|pyspark-pandas-connect-part2|\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n|1h 51m|2h 55m|1h 54m|\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this PR is proposed to improve the build infra.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nWe should manually check the CI from GitHub Actions after PR is opened.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDeflake tests in ReattachableExecuteSuite and increase CONNECT_EXECUTE_REATTACHABLE_OBSERVER_RETRY_BUFFER_SIZE.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTwo tests could be flaky with errors `INVALID_CURSOR.POSITION_NOT_AVAILABLE`.\r\nThis is caused when a server releases the response when it falls more than CONNECT_EXECUTE_REATTACHABLE_OBSERVER_RETRY_BUFFER_SIZE behind the latest response it sent. However, because of HTTP2 flow control, the responses could still be in transit. In the test suite, we were explicitly disconnecting the iterators and later reconnect... In some cases they could not reconnect, because the response they last seen have fallen too fare behind.\r\n\r\nThis not only changes the suite, but also adjust the default config. This potentially makes the reconnecting more robust. In normal situation, it should not lead to increased memory pressure, because the clients also release the responses using ReleaseExecute as soon as they are received. Normally, buffered responses should be freed by ReleaseExecute and this retry buffer is only a fallback mechanism. Therefore, it is safe to increase the default.\r\n\r\nIn practice, this would only have effect in cases where there are actual network errors, and the increased buffer size should make the reconnects more robust in these cases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nReattachableExecuteSuite.\r\nDid more manual experiments of how far the response sent by client can be behind the response sent by server (because of HTTP2 flow control window)\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a point-and-click interface that reuses the STATUS column on the stage tab/page to enable trigger rendering of the newly added TaskThreadDumpPage.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/8326978/549f5adf-e21d-48f6-95d1-ec0ed613f160)\r\n\r\nAs you can see above, the point-and-click interface shows only for RUNNING tasks.\r\n\r\nDuring rendering, it will locate the executor by executorId and send a TaskThreadDump message to it to fetch the thread info by taskId. It then displays\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/8326978/bc1ff9dd-9d5a-4c01-922a-fdee804e776a)\r\n\r\nTHis PR also make it support for rest API.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a small followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42850. `getBytes` checks if the `dictionary` is null or not, then call `getByte` which also checks if the `dictionary` is null or not. This PR avoids the repeated if checks by copying one line code from `getByte` to `getBytes`. The same applies to other `getXXX` methods.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add a simple Java example, `JavaSparkSQLCli.java`. Like SparkPi example, we can take advantage of this minimal example with `bin/run-example` and we can run a simple SQL query as a canary test during RC testing and voting phase.\r\n\r\n-

`org.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.SparkSQLCLIDriver` and `bin/spark-sql` shell environment, it requires `-Phive -Phive-thriftserver` explicitly.\r\n```\r\n$ bin/spark-shell --version\r\nWelcome

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr downgrade `scala-maven-plugin` to version 4.7.1 to avoid it automatically adding the `-release` option as a Scala compilation argument.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe `scala-maven-plugin` versions 4.7.2 and later will try to automatically append the `-release` option as a Scala compilation argument when it is not specified by the user:\r\n\r\n1. 4.7.2 and 4.8.0: try to add the `-release` option for Scala versions 2.13.9 and higher.\r\n2. 4.8.1: try to append the `-release` option for Scala versions 2.12.x/2.13.x/3.1.1, and append `-java-output-version` for Scala 3.1.2.\r\n\r\nThe addition of the `-release` option has caused issues mentioned in SPARK-44376 | https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41943 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40442#issuecomment-1474161688. This is because the `-release` option has stronger compilation restrictions than `-target`, ensuring not only bytecode format, but also that the API used in the code is compatible with the specified version of Java. However, many APIs in the `sun.*` package are not `exports` in Java 11, 17, and 21, such as `sun.nio.ch.DirectBuffer`, `sun.util.calendar.ZoneInfo`, and `sun.nio.cs.StreamDecoder`, making them invisible when compiling across different versions.\r\n\r\nFor discussions within the Scala community, see https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/12643, https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/12824, https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/12866,  but this is not a bug.\r\n\r\nI have also submitted an issue to the `scala-maven-plugin` community to discuss the possibility of adding additional settings to control the addition of the `-release` option: https://github.com/davidB/scala-maven-plugin/issues/722.\r\n\r\nFor Apache Spark 4.0, in the short term, I suggest downgrading `scala-maven-plugin` to version 4.7.1 to avoid it automatic adding the `-release` option as a Scala compilation argument. In the long term, we should reduce use of APIs that are not `exports` for compatibility with the `-release` compilation option due to `-target` already deprecated after Scala 2.13.9.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GitHub Actions\r\n- Manual check\r\n\r\nrun `git revert 656bf36363c466b60d00452399994ccaaa654ed8` to revert to using Scala 2.13.11 and run `dev/change-scala-version.sh 2.13` to change Scala to 2.13\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to move the `BindParameters` rules from the `Substitution` to the `Resolution` batch, and change types of the `args` parameter of `NameParameterizedQuery` and `PosParameterizedQuery` to an `Iterable` to resolve argument expressions. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAfter the PR, the parameterized `sql()` allows map/array/struct constructed by functions like `map()`, `array()`, and `struct()`, but the same functions invoked via `call_function` are not supported:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT element_at(:mapParam, 'a')\", Map(\"mapParam\" -> call_function(\"map\", lit(\"a\"), lit(1))))\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.ExtendedAnalysisException: [UNBOUND_SQL_PARAMETER] Found the unbound parameter: mapParam. Please, fix `args` and provide a mapping of the parameter to a SQL literal.; line 1 pos 18;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, should not since it fixes an issue. Only if user code depends on the error message.\r\n\r\nAfter the changes:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT element_at(:mapParam, 'a')\", Map(\"mapParam\" -> call_function(\"map\", lit(\"a\"), lit(1)))).show(false)\r\n+------------------------+\r\n|element_at(map(a, 1), a)|\r\n+------------------------+\r\n|1                       |\r\n+------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ParametersSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-09-12T19:31:10Z","updated_at":"2023-09-14T08:32:05Z","closed_at":"2023-09-14T08:32:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"540414994ca121a5c05098ef75287e5744db83b9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42894/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42894/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42894/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/769aa7a37f4921f9bc257fa69e7d154f7e34043f","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-parameterized-sql-unresolved","ref":"fix-parameterized-sql-unresolved","sha":"769aa7a37f4921f9bc257fa69e7d154f7e34043f","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe description is listed in [Jira SPARK-44459](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44459).\r\nI faced an issue when running ~90 streaming queries in parallel in one driver. Driver memory footprint(max heap and used heap) was constantly increasing until reached the node limit(in my case ~110 GBs) and the driver got killed. When I checked the heap dump, I observed hundred of millions of `java.lang.ref.Finalizer` and `java.util.zip.*` entries. When I dug into the code, I found that on Java 8 - many classes from `java.util.zip.*` include non-empty `finalize` method.\r\nThis, in turn, leads to accumulation of references to classes to be GCed, and only `finalizer` thread(**one per JVM**) can run the non-empty `finalize` method, and only then memory will be released by GC. Also, many classes from `java.util.zip.*` hold references to native(C) memory, so the situation is even worse since not only heap memory is accumulating. I verified it's an issue with finalization queue when checked JMX bean related to finalization queue size.\r\nI ensured this comes from the Spark package by finding a problematic part of Spark - when I turned off SparkUI - the problem disappeared. As per my findings, the issue comes from `netty` using `java.util.zip` heavily, and a large number of tasks leads to an enormous production rate, so in multithreaded code `finalizer` thread could not keep up with the increasing `Reference` queue.\r\nThere are [detailed article with figures](https://medium.com/@vitali.makarevich/spark-structured-streaming-and-java-util-zip-and-finalize-method-83181c6bc86f) - let me know if you want me to put it all here.\r\nI made a fix by running logic similar to existing in spark with `System.runFinalization()` and memory consumption normalized and the application can run for weeks, but it would be good if others had the same fix and didn't spend weeks finding the cause.\r\nIf you want, I can add a configuration value controlling whether this logic should be run, so any potential bottlenecks could be avoided by existing users.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nJava 8 environment with similar conditions(e.g. a lot of streaming queries in parallel with a lot of tasks) should have the same problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIt has no change the user will face, but in theory, with some circumstances client may see reduction in performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI have an application running this in production. I don't expect any existing test to fail since this logic only improves the cleanup process and it's not covered by any existing test. I don't expect performance/benchmark to degrade(although can admit there may be problems with some combination of JVM/GC).\r\nI think there may be a way to check the finalization queue size from the code(similar to the JMX bean I used to catch the issue) to check that it has an effect, but it looks to be a very native operation that has no possibility to work incorrectly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-12T17:59:51Z","updated_at":"2023-12-30T00:18:07Z","closed_at":"2023-12-30T00:18:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3e7071b894378548e6c5714dd6fb9c860ec4159d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42893/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42893/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42893/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/be46b56795768350ed63bd6511b0b08b50f2315f","head":{"label":"VitoMakarevich:SPARK-44459","ref":"SPARK-44459","sha":"be46b56795768350ed63bd6511b0b08b50f2315f","user":{"login":"VitoMakarevich","id":15978165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc4MTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15978165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitoMakarevich","html_url":"https://github.com/VitoMakarevich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitoMakarevich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitoMakarevich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitoMakarevich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitoMakarevich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitoMakarevich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitoMakarevich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitoMakarevich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitoMakarevich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitoMakarevich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":690695089,"node_id":"R_kgDOKSsrsQ","name":"spark","full_name":"VitoMakarevich/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"VitoMakarevich","id":15978165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTc4MTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15978165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitoMakarevich","html_url":"https://github.com/VitoMakarevich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitoMakarevich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitoMakarevich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitoMakarevich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitoMakarevich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitoMakarevich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitoMakarevich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitoMakarevich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitoMakarevich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitoMakarevich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/VitoMakarevich/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the situation before, query will only be FINISHED when all results have been pushed into the output buffers (not necessarily received by client, but pushed out of the server).\r\n\r\nFor LocalTableScanExec, post FINISHED before sending result batches, because nothing is executed, only cached local results are returned. For regular execution, post FINISHED after all task results have been returned from Spark, not after they have been processed and sent out.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, even if a query finished running in Spark, it keeps being RUNNING until all results are sent. Then there is a very small difference between FINISHED and CLOSED. This change makes it behave more similar to e.g. Thriftserver.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Queries will be posted as FINISHED when they finish executing, not when they finish sending results.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWill add test in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42560\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDue to a quirk in the parser, in some cases, IDENTIFIER(<funcStr>)(<arg>) is not properly recognized as a function invocation.\r\n\r\nThe change is to remove the explicit IDENTIFIER-clause rule in the function invocation grammar and instead recognize\r\nIDENTIFIER(<arg>) within visitFunctionCall.\r\n  \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFunction invocation support for IDENTIFIER is incomplete otherwise\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded new testcases to identifier-clause.sql\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, to avoid data copy, Spark connect ML model directly changes input pandas dataframe for appending prediction columns. But we can use `pandas_df.copy(deep=False)` to shallow copy it and then append prediction columns in copied dataframe. This is easier for user to use it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis makes `pyspark.ml.connect` model `transform` method has more similar behavior with `pyspark.ml` model, i.e., the input dataframe is intact after `transform` is called. Otherwise user might be surprise at the new behavior and have to change more code to migrate their workload to `pyspark.ml.connect`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. \r\nPrevious behavior:\r\nIn `pyspark.ml.connect`, `model.transform` will append new columns into input pandas dataframe, and return input dataframe object.\r\n\r\nChanged behavior:\r\nIn `pyspark.ml.connect`, `model.transform` will shallow copy input pandas dataframe and append new columns into shallow copied pandas dataframe, then return copied pandas dataframe.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the use of `userId` and `sessionId` in `CachedLocalRelation` messages and subsequently make `SparkConnectPlanner` use the `userId`/`sessionId` of the active session rather than the user-provided information.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAllowing a fetch of a local relation using user-provided information is a potential security risk since this allows users to fetch arbitrary local relations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nVirtually no. It will ignore the session id or user id that users set (but instead use internal ones that users cannot manipulate).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-12T03:10:52Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:48:15Z","closed_at":"2023-09-12T05:59:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3532863a0c75893421f71d9ec4b004a2c79aa852","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42880/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42880/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42880/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fd107c8c6c24d666e3bdf0a79080a5b6618af533","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:no-local-user","ref":"no-local-user","sha":"fd107c8c6c24d666e3bdf0a79080a5b6618af533","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- This PR implements the missing otherCopyArgs in the MultiCommutativeOp expression\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Without this method implementation, calling toJSON will throw an exception from the TreeNode::jsonFields method.\r\n- This is because the jsonFields method has an assertion that the number of fields defined in the constructor is equal to the number of field values (productIterator.toSeq ++ otherCopyArgs).\r\n- The originalRoot field of the MultiCommutativeOp is not part of the productIterator. Hence, it has to be explicitly set in the otherCopyArgs field.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n- No\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added unit test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUptake `--bind-address` parameter in `YarnCoarseGrainedExecutorBackend` when launching new container in Yarn cluster. This PR also ensure `YarnAllocator` uses default hostname when its not configured.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe've came across https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/27900 with Spark running on Yarn in Istio enabled Kubernetes cluster. Previous PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32633 is not merged because Spark 2.4 was EOL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, new config specifically for Yarn cluster mode is added and relevant doc is updated.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested in Kubenetes with Istio and added tests to

Spark Connect does.  \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIf we can make the SQL and Connect Dataset functions similar then we can move the functions to `sql-api` module.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting UTs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix `aes_descrypt` and `ln` implementations in Spark Connect. The previous `aes_descrypt` reference to `aes_encrypt` is clearly a bug. The `ln` reference to `log` is more like a cosmetic issue, but because `ln` and `log` function implementations are different in Spark SQL we should use the same implementation in Spark Connect too.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBugfix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, these Spark Connect functions haven't been released.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nEsiting UTs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-10T09:08:46Z","updated_at":"2023-09-11T17:24:07Z","closed_at":"2023-09-11T00:07:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c1c304de417b8ccc711f35a88b622ed784c05cc1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42863/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42863/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42863/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/96c0998f5d7532b2004a4c8f3307b357fdbeaab4","head":{"label":"peter-toth:SPARK-45109-fix-eas_decrypt-and-ln","ref":"SPARK-45109-fix-eas_decrypt-and-ln","sha":"96c0998f5d7532b2004a4c8f3307b357fdbeaab4","user":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130546049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA1NDYwNDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"peter-toth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes a simple change in the documentation for the `transform` function in `sql`. I believe where it currently reads \"filter\" it should read \"transform\".\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nI believe this change might not be needed per se, but it would be a slight improvement to the current version to avoid the misnomer.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it shows the word \"transform' instead of \"filter\" in the documentation for the `transform` `sql`. function.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis patch was not tested because it only changes documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange `PercentileCont` to explicitly check user-supplied input by calling `checkInputDataTypes` on the replacement.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`PercentileCont` does not currently check the user's input. If the runtime replacement (an instance of `Percentile`) rejects the user's input, the runtime replacement ends up unresolved.\r\n\r\nFor example, this query throws an internal error rather than producing a useful error message:\r\n```\r\nselect percentile_cont(b) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a DESC) as x \r\nfrom (values (12, 0.25), (13, 0.25), (22, 0.25)) as (a, b);\r\n\r\n[INTERNAL_ERROR] Cannot resolve the runtime replaceable expression \"percentile_cont(a, b)\". The replacement is unresolved: \"percentile(a, b, 1)\".\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: [INTERNAL_ERROR] Cannot resolve the runtime replaceable expression \"percentile_cont(a, b)\". The replacement is unresolved: \"percentile(a, b, 1)\".\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.SparkException$.internalError(SparkException.scala:92)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.SparkException$.internalError(SparkException.scala:96)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.CheckAnalysis.$anonfun$checkAnalysis0$6(CheckAnalysis.scala:313)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.CheckAnalysis.$anonfun$checkAnalysis0$6$adapted(CheckAnalysis.scala:277)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nWith this PR, the above query will produce the following error message:\r\n```\r\n[DATATYPE_MISMATCH.NON_FOLDABLE_INPUT] Cannot resolve \"percentile_cont(a, b)\" due to data type mismatch: the input percentage should be a foldable \"DOUBLE\" expression; however, got \"b\".; line 1 pos 7;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-08T14:27:16Z","updated_at":"2023-09-14T16:12:42Z","closed_at":"2023-09-08T19:38:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e5bd5a2ab6b27b541eb9c9131b3d5ff53797a5b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42857/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42857/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42857/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d4a2c73dc109d7a8c86fcdb7affba706f5baf719","head":{"label":"bersprockets:pc_checkinputtype_issue","ref":"pc_checkinputtype_issue","sha":"d4a2c73dc109d7a8c86fcdb7affba706f5baf719","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to check that the `class` and `method` arguments are not a NULL in `CallMethodViaReflection`. And if they are, throw an `AnalysisException` with new error class `DATATYPE_MISMATCH.UNEXPECTED_NULL`.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42849.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the issue demonstrated by the example:\r\n```sql\r\n$ spark-sql (default)> select reflect('java.util.UUID', CAST(NULL AS STRING));\r\n[INTERNAL_ERROR] The Spark SQL phase analysis failed with an internal error. You hit a bug in Spark or the Spark plugins you use. Please, report this bug to the corresponding communities or vendors, and provide the full stack trace.\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *.MiscFunctionsSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to check that the `class` and `method` arguments are not a NULL in `CallMethodViaReflection`. And if they are, throw an `AnalysisException` with new error class `DATATYPE_MISMATCH.UNEXPECTED_NULL`.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42849.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the issue demonstrated by the example:\r\n```sql\r\n$ spark-sql (default)> select reflect('java.util.UUID', CAST(NULL AS STRING));\r\n[INTERNAL_ERROR] The Spark SQL phase analysis failed with an internal error. You hit a bug in Spark or the Spark plugins you use. Please, report this bug to the corresponding communities or vendors, and provide the full stack trace.\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *.MiscFunctionsSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI
