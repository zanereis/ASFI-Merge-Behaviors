Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n#2237 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis change adds reconnect policy class and CRUD retry operation for MetaClient. Will add impl for adopting reconnect policy in MetaClient in next PR. (test will be add in that PR as well)\r\n Reconnect policy : User can define behavior for auto reconnect when connection is expired or lost.\r\n CRUD retry config: User may config a timeout. MetaClient will reissue CRUD operation if connection is re-established within timeout. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTest will be added when implementing reconnect policy. Will add e2e test for retey connection and CRUD since CRUD retry waits for reconnection established signal.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-01T01:48:56Z","updated_at":"2023-03-11T06:26:02Z","closed_at":"2023-03-11T06:26:01Z","merged_at":"2023-03-11T06:26:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"2b636132b8e357f56f10d7db346b165375dd03d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2385/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2385/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2385/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/3ae79760f26548c6cddddf09f500f0cbc8488518","head":{"label":"xyuanlu:meta-client-beta2","ref":"meta-client-beta2","sha":"3ae79760f26548c6cddddf09f500f0cbc8488518","user":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260321741,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAzMjE3NDE=","name":"helix","full_name":"xyuanlu/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nHelix has been using JDK 1.8. We want to move to latest JDK but prior to that, we can use JDK11 as intermediate step. This will help us remain current and use all the language optimizations for performance improvements.\r\n\r\nWe were using Jetty - 9.4.48.v20220622 and Jersey version 2.15.\r\nBoth these versions were not compatible with JDK11.\r\nIf you go with the latest version of Jetty and latest of Jersey, the REST Server never starts.\r\nSo we need to do 2 levels of compatibility:\r\n- with JDK 11 compatibility\r\n- compatibility amongst both of them. \r\n\r\nIt took me while to figure out Jetty/Jersey compatibility. In addition some APIs had changed.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testDisablingTopStateReplicaByDisablingInstance:98 expected:<false> but was:<true>\r\n[ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testNoThrottleOnDisabledInstance:231->setupEnvironment:317->setupCluster:436 » ZkClient\r\n[ERROR]   TestP2PNoDuplicatedMessage.testP2PStateTransitionEnabled:180 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestMultiZkConnectionConfig>MultiZkTestBase.afterClass:137 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestMultiZkConnectionConfig.testZKHelixManager:295->Object.wait:328->Object.wait:-2 » ThreadTimeout\r\n[ERROR]   TestWagedRebalanceFaultZone.testAddZone:270->validate:318->validateZoneAndTagIsolation:342 expected:<3> but was:<2>\r\n[ERROR]   TestTaskStateModelFactory.testZkClientCreationMultiZk:80 » Bind Address alread...\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1325, Failures: 7, Errors: 0, Skipped: 6\r\n\r\nI ran all the 7 failures as independent test-runs. Some tests passed on running while some failed. I took a fresh code branch with no changes and ran the same failed tests against it and they failed there as well. So between re-run and clean branch, there are NO NEW failures.\r\n\r\n\r\nPR-CI run is completely GREEN (including all other components)\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/actions/runs/4289361614\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-24T00:47:18Z","updated_at":"2023-02-28T21:29:27Z","closed_at":"2023-02-28T21:29:27Z","merged_at":"2023-02-28T21:29:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"a180628893d148da32385f1baef88f60c1ffceb2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2384/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2384/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2384/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/81ef1a82d3cc4193b6fe5990623b3d76da851c4b","head":{"label":"desaikomal:jdk11","ref":"jdk11","sha":"81ef1a82d3cc4193b6fe5990623b3d76da851c4b","user":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":452080859,"node_id":"R_kgDOGvI02w","name":"helix","full_name":"desaikomal/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #2345 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR emits a new metric which will report number of partitions with missing top state beyond threshold value. It will update this value as soon as top state goes missing for a partition. This metric will be reset only after default reset time i.e., 1 min. \r\nExisting two metrics - FailedTopStateHandoffCounter and PartitionTopStateNonGracefulHandoffGauge are very much similar and they both try to say that top state is missing beyond certain threshold. So we would deprecate both this metrics and encourage to use this new guage.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nCurrent test testTopStateFailedHandoff takes care of all scenarios. Updated this test with detailed scenario.\r\n```\r\nmvn test -Dtest=TestTopStateHandoffMetrics\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 11, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 18.308 s - in org.apache.helix.monitoring.mbeans.TestTopStateHandoffMetrics\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 11, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO]\r\n```\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API.

doesn't permit it. This is also a issue in HelixZkClient testbase. However, it has been tested and confirmed that the actual behavior does work (in native zkclient) and is merely a unit testing bug. Will track and fix this effort in the future but current implementation will use existing test base framework.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nN.A.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAs suggested in https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/2353#discussion_r1090064049.\r\nCurrently we are passing in a boolean param indicating the type of listener, one-time or persistent. In this PR, we are replacing it with separate APIs for subscribing with persistent vs one-time listener, to make the interface more clear.\r\n\r\nThe difference the two types are:\r\n- One-time listener is fired at most once on event, and removed right after its invocation\r\n- Persistent listener can only be removed explicitly by client, and should not miss event firing. However, it's still possible the client is offline while the event is happening.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we created new set of default methods in the interface with `NotImplementedException` thrown for one-time listener. The implementation logic and unit tests are updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nUpdated tests in `TestZkMetaClient`\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Both these pipelines gets triggered whenever any new PR is created and /or merged. But if anyone wants to run tests with few different maven options (maybe like rat, verify etc) or trigger builds after adding any workflow then there is not workflow for it.\r\nAsk here is add a workflow which allows to manually trigger a CI pipeline on-demand an any PR with customized maven options.\r\n\r\nProposed solution :\r\nA new workflow can be added which implements \"workflow_dispatch\" and allow input fields for user to accept maven build options and PR path.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTried this options locally and it works but workflow itself can not be tested until it's added to repo.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\nNA\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds

After analyzing its failures it looks like that many of those failures are due to some uncontrolled situations like previous tests stale zk client interruption, callbacks. This can be fixed if this tests are re-run independently. Currently all contributors have to manually re-run this failing tests locally and and once it passes it can be shows as a proof.\r\n\r\nSolutions :\r\nThis fix proposes to use [surefire plugin](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/rerun-failing-tests.html) to re-run failing tests. This plugin re-runs failing test independently in same CI pipeline run.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nI verified this option on my repo 4 times and all 4 times CI run was successful. Although this doesn't guarantee that CI will never fail due to flaky tests but it gives enough confidence for us to try this option in our CI pipelines. \r\n![Screenshot 2023-02-13 at 10 33 02

The class level synchronization in FederatedZkClient is deemed unnecessary after reviewing. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestDedicatedZkClient\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally.

screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the direct child change listener in ZkMetaClient using the native ZkClient.\r\n\r\nThere is a known issue with the native zkclient in use where it's not providing real persistent listener functionalities, and event might be lost. This will be tracked and fixed in separate PRs.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNew test in `TestZkMetaClient`\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 10, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 117.143 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 10, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ meta-client ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/qqu/workspace/qqu-helix/meta-client/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Meta Client' with 40 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  02:08 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2023-01-27T10:53:44-05:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n #2237\r\nAs we implement zkMetaClient APIs, we need proper error handling and error code forwarding. We need a separate set of error code other than reusing ZK error code.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds MetaClient code and translator helper function from zkException code.\r\nIt also refine a util function naming.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNA\r\nTest will be added when user of metaclient error code is implemented.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-27T00:49:07Z","updated_at":"2023-02-03T00:10:38Z","closed_at":"2023-02-03T00:10:38Z","merged_at":"2023-02-03T00:10:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"573b1c9dea650fa5bd07837414724201d58a519b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2351/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2351/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2351/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/c1ea4a249f8b4bc7b308d537eacb2d5118c1d811","head":{"label":"xyuanlu:metaclient_3_util","ref":"metaclient_3_util","sha":"c1ea4a249f8b4bc7b308d537eacb2d5118c1d811","user":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260321741,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAzMjE3NDE=","name":"helix","full_name":"xyuanlu/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #2349 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\nSince Helix is one of the core components, we were still using JDK 8 waiting for most of our customers to be already upgraded before us upgrading.\r\n\r\nIn October 2022, we proposed to upgrade the JDK version from 1.8 to JDK 11 which was approved by the Apache Helix chair/committer.\r\nSo this change is only introducing bumping up the version.\r\nRest of the optimization which JDK11 brings will be done as follow up changes.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally.

They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-24T16:54:16Z","updated_at":"2023-03-12T20:23:39Z","closed_at":"2023-03-12T20:23:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54d24e9249c571639a7452b9271eca0bd2c65ab4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2350/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2350/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2350/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/9e8b028dff6b566a42af7ec23fc361081925fd6e","head":{"label":"desaikomal:kdesai/big","ref":"kdesai/big","sha":"9e8b028dff6b566a42af7ec23fc361081925fd6e","user":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":452080859,"node_id":"R_kgDOGvI02w","name":"helix","full_name":"desaikomal/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal/helix","description":"Mirror

Local build and test ran (some test failures), so trying to compare and contrast with what happens on CI here.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Write a concise description including what, why, how)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1.

of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nPrepare zkclient and implement new adapter for child change listener.\r\n**The real implementation of child change listener in meta-client is left for future PR.**\r\n\r\nSimilar as https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/2333, this PR adds a new default method in `IZkChildListener` to make it applicable to be used in meta-client. Implement a adapter class that bridges the old and new listener interface.\r\nMove previous inner converter class to separate module. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nChange in zookeeper-api and meta-client are both backward compatible, covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 67, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1,044.795 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 67, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ zookeeper-api ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/qqu/workspace/qqu-helix/zookeeper-api/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: ZooKeeper API' with 116 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  17:40 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2023-01-20T11:36:57-05:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #2345 : Adds a new metric to report real time missing top state for any partition for each resource in a cluster.\r\n\r\n(#200 - Link your issue number here: You can write \"Fixes #XXX\". Please use the proper keyword so that the issue gets closed automatically. See https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue\r\nAny of the following keywords can be used: close, closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves, resolved)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIssue :\r\nCurrently, if waged rebalancer is used then there could be a situation where multiple leader replicas are residing on same node. If that node goes down for maintainence or for any other reason then there is no current metric which reports about missing top state until any rebalancer event is triggered. \r\n\r\nAsk :\r\nAsk here is to add a metric which satisfies following conditions :\r\n1. The metric should be at resource level and should be reported irrespective of top state replica is recovered or not for any partition of that resource.\r\n2. This metric should be started as soon as \"any\" partition for a resource has top state missing and it should be \"reset\" only when that resource has no partition with missing top state.\r\n\r\nSolution :\r\nThe solution proposed in this PR starts a async thread as soon as first partition of any resource has top state missing and it continuously reports missing top state duration (atleast once in sliding window interval) for partitions at resource level as long as that resource has \"at least one\" partition with missing top state. If there are no resources with any partitions with missing top state then this async thread will sleep.\r\nThe guage reported by this thread is histogram which won't give exact values but will approximate about duration increasing and will be reset when all top state replicas for that resource are recovered. \r\n\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n(Write a concise description including what, why, how)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nCI pipeline and added new tests for verifying metrics.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn test -Dtest=TestTopStateHandoffMetrics\r\n[WARNING] Tests run: 12, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 18.723 s - in org.apache.helix.monitoring.mbeans.TestTopStateHandoffMetrics\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[WARNING] Tests run: 12, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally.

screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n1. Implementation of the transactionOp() operation method in zkMetaClient. This method enables transactional support by converting metaclient operations into zk ops and running the zk.multi() method. The results are converted back from zk opResults to metaclient opResults.\r\n2. Created a separate util class zkMetaClientUtil for Util functions and the logic behind the implementation of transactionOp().\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n`testMultiOps` and `testMultiFail` in `TestZkMetaClient`.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nN.A.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nImplement a thread-safe listener container for zkclient listener management.\r\nThis is introduced to better support metaclient implementation, where:\r\n1. New functionalities added with the introduction of \"one-time\" listener in metaclient (now in zkclient, all listeners are \"persistent\")\r\n2. Better encapsulation and code refactoring\r\n\r\nThis PR added the main class `ListenerContainer` that contains the core functionalities.\r\nThe next PR will be have zkclient adopt this new component, then implement the new funcs for one-time listener.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n`TestListenerContainer`\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 78, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1,115.267 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 78, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ zookeeper-api ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/qqu/workspace/qqu-helix/zookeeper-api/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: ZooKeeper API' with 116 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  18:50 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2023-01-10T14:48:02-05:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nN.A.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nSome new features and improve in zookeeper-api to prepare meta-client implementation.\r\n\r\n1. Add a new method in `IZkDataListener` and a converter class in `ZkMetaClient` so that it's easier to reuse existing zkclient.\r\n2. Implement `connectOnInit` flag (backward compatible) to control whether zkclient should connect during initialization. (Meta-client API will require a separate connect() method to be called explicitly to connect.)\r\n3. Minor change in the code flow, constructor and ZkClientMonitor.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n[INFO] Reactor Summary for Apache Helix 1.0.5-SNAPSHOT:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Apache Helix .......................................

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nN.A.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/2306\r\n\r\nRefactor the zookeeper-api module as preparation for DataChangeListener notification implementation in ZkMetaClient.\r\nA new set of listeners need to be triggered on ZK events, and in order to support this, the watcher has to be registered from the new meta-client module. We CANNOT reuse ZkClient to implement the new listener interface because it's introducing circular dependency.\r\n\r\nThe change includes:\r\n1. Accepts `watcher` as param in ZkClient construction, in order to override the watcher registration while maintain backward compatibility.\r\n2. Introduce `boolean connectOnInit`, zkclient was default to connect right after class initialization, this is causing trouble in ZkMetaClient implementation because the instance might not be fully constructed and causing `NullPointerException`. In MetaClient API, `connect` is a standalone method and supposed to be invoked separately. \r\n3. Marking a few methods and class public to be reused in meta-client module\r\n4. Fixing some typo and styling.\r\n\r\nThis PR also enables Helix PR CI for this feature branch to have better coverage during development.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n2022-12-19T19:50:35.7766335Z [info] ./helix-core/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 1319, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 6,140.342 s - in TestSuite\r\n2022-12-19T19:50:35.7773618Z [info] ./metadata-store-directory-common/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 31, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 2.995 s - in TestSuite\r\n2022-12-19T19:50:35.7774976Z [info] ./helix-rest/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 208, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 173.517 s - in TestSuite\r\n2022-12-19T19:50:35.7780928Z [info] ./helix-common/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.275 s - in TestSuite\r\n2022-12-19T19:50:35.7789686Z [info] ./zookeeper-api/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 67, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 183.284 s - in TestSuite\r\n2022-12-19T19:50:35.7792624Z [info] ./helix-lock/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 11, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 52.773 s - in TestSuite\r\n2022-12-19T19:50:35.7798219Z [info] ./metrics-common/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.382 s - in TestSuite\r\n2022-12-19T19:50:35.7799439Z [info] ./recipes/task-execution/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.462 s - in TestSuite\r\n2022-12-19T19:50:35.7801005Z [info] ./recipes/rabbitmq-consumer-group/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.706 s - in TestSuite\r\n2022-12-19T19:50:35.7802214Z [info] ./recipes/service-discovery/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.643 s - in TestSuite\r\n2022-12-19T19:50:35.7804771Z [info] ./recipes/distributed-lock-manager/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.601 s - in TestSuite\r\n2022-12-19T19:50:35.7805790Z [info] ./recipes/rsync-replicated-file-system/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.733 s - in TestSuite\r\n2022-12-19T19:50:35.7807476Z [info] ./helix-view-aggregator/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 15, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 80.888 s - in TestSuite\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-19T17:56:32Z","updated_at":"2023-01-04T19:25:44Z","closed_at":"2023-01-04T19:25:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1c414be46d75705c3a970743b9944738bf7fb16d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2325/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2325/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2325/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/376c9d60f1ee87214b8bb3595bac9ce0717d757f","head":{"label":"qqu0127:datachange-refactor","ref":"datachange-refactor","sha":"376c9d60f1ee87214b8bb3595bac9ce0717d757f","user":{"login":"qqu0127","id":19682637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjgyNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19682637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127","html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":444938840,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoU6WA","name":"helix","full_name":"qqu0127/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"qqu0127","id":19682637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjgyNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19682637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127","html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127/helix","description":"Mirror

All reviews from previous PRs apply to this PR. \r\n\r\nThis PR implements a redesign to WAGED pipeline, which includes the following:\r\n1. Introducing the emergency rebalance process. Emergency is run every pipeline, but not necessarily do concrete work (conditional work). Emergency triggers partial. \r\n2. Partial rebalance is now asynchronous. At most 1 thread of partial rebalance happens at the same time. \r\n3. Add conditions to skip rebalance overwrite. \r\n4. Move cluster model generation to asynchronous global rebalance thread for better performance.\r\n5. Changes some API to AssignmentMetadata for operation purposes. a) the persistX functions no longer include the \"check for same assignment\" logic for early termination, instead, this logic is moved to the callers. This allows us to accurately track write latency - the latency is only measured if persistence happens. b) boolean return values are meant to indicate persistence failures; therefore, regular persistX functions no longer return boolean values since they are already guarded by exceptions, but the async persist returns false if the version is stale. \r\n\r\nThe overall effect is increased pipeline performance, which has been confirmed in simulation tests. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\ntestRebalanceOverwriteTrigger, testEmergencyRebalance\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-06T23:20:49Z","updated_at":"2022-12-08T18:36:50Z","closed_at":"2022-12-08T18:36:50Z","merged_at":"2022-12-08T18:36:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"917b786e4da9a615c5177f27256e170feae2298f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2308/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2308/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2308/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/96f58c31abd6fb2186473e66c5d34e587127f635","head":{"label":"qqu0127:fix-revision","ref":"fix-revision","sha":"96f58c31abd6fb2186473e66c5d34e587127f635","user":{"login":"qqu0127","id":19682637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjgyNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19682637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127","html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":444938840,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoU6WA","name":"helix","full_name":"qqu0127/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"qqu0127","id":19682637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjgyNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19682637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127","html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127/helix","description":"Mirror

Some key ideas of this change:\r\n1. Reuse ZkClient and its connection as possible\r\n2. Re-implement the watcher interface in ZkMetaClient, and register this class as watcher\r\n3. Re-implement the event thread used in ZkMetaClient\r\n4. Thread-safe ListenerContainer\r\n5. refactoring in zookeeper-api module to allow watcher override\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nTestZkMetaClient\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-06T20:52:18Z","updated_at":"2023-02-22T21:43:42Z","closed_at":"2023-02-22T21:43:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"00854ea7ebc684fe3d4453505e775994c3639500","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2306/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2306/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2306/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/5e4196b573c6e1c95b3b0f7d83129c4e820e0c4e","head":{"label":"qqu0127:data-change-impl","ref":"data-change-impl","sha":"5e4196b573c6e1c95b3b0f7d83129c4e820e0c4e","user":{"login":"qqu0127","id":19682637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjgyNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19682637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127","html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":444938840,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoU6WA","name":"helix","full_name":"qqu0127/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"qqu0127","id":19682637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjgyNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19682637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127","html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127/helix","description":"Mirror

Even though `helix-front` does not have any `maven-surefire` tests (since `helix-front` is a TypeScript/JavaScript project with its own tests in those languages), it seems that it is still necessary to skip the non-existent maven-surefire tests in order to avoid the `suiteXmlFiles is configured, but there is no TestNG dependency` error message.\r\n\r\nFinally, this PR makes minor formatting changes to a code comment in `pom.xml` in order to trigger a CI build.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n[Helix-2296](https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2296)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe test flakiness is due to comparisons between Json Strings.\r\nHowever, JsonObject does not guarantee entry orders, its object is an unordered set of name/value pairs, and internal permutations may occur in the output as JSON String.\r\n\r\nSince JSON library `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind` is used in the current project, And in this test, `ObjectMapper`and used to read a json file.\r\nUse `mapper.readTree(JSON String)` when comparing them, thus, the equals() method ignores the order and treats them as equal.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 206, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 172.33 s - in

Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #2294. Currently, while creating a new ZkClient object, operation retry timeout is not set explicitly in all of the workflows which makes it pick default operation retry timeout which is INT_MAX. It translates as 24 days, this is too long for a single zk operation retry timeout. This PR fixes this default timeout at all places to 1 day. We can set it to any value but 1 days seems reasonable change from 24 days to me. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhy changing default timeout?\r\n- There are many ways this timeout can be set and out of them client config is used most of the time to set this zookeeper operation timeout. But in existing uses of ZkClient, it relies on default operation retry timeout of the client config which is nothing but INT_MAX. Hence rather that changing timeout at all places in code changing this default timeout to reasonable timeout.\r\n\r\nWhat is it should changed to?\r\n- The original timeout was set to 24 days based on observations and past experiences but for a single zookeeper operation this timeout is unreasonable. Now it's being set to 1 day which is till very long for a zookeeper operation retry but it can be overwritten by individual client.  \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nmvn tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nNo new tests added. \r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\nNA\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\nNA\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-25T07:21:09Z","updated_at":"2022-12-07T02:43:07Z","closed_at":"2022-12-07T02:43:07Z","merged_at":"2022-12-07T02:43:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"f4016b706ac26716b85330b07771b7b0fe54ba17","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2293/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2293/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2293/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/10e909ee6a25ba94435a333c97b3c1e9c45c64a2","head":{"label":"rahulrane50:opn_retry_timeout","ref":"opn_retry_timeout","sha":"10e909ee6a25ba94435a333c97b3c1e9c45c64a2","user":{"login":"rahulrane50","id":23309709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzA5NzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23309709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50","html_url":"https://github.com/rahulrane50","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":467212008,"node_id":"R_kgDOG9kW6A","name":"helix","full_name":"rahulrane50/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rahulrane50","id":23309709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzA5NzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23309709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50","html_url":"https://github.com/rahulrane50","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rahulrane50/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2240\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nTo test implementation of FederatedZkClient Multi, tests must be written. Mainly rearranged current test base for cleaner code and added specific test for FederatedZkClient multi support. This pull request is part 1 of 2 for implementing transaction support in zk client.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nSolely rearranged tests under /multizk and combined similar code to clean up the tests. Wrote separate test to test future implementation of FederatedZkClient ZkMulti in testMultiInMultiZk. Currently FederatedZkClient ZkMulti is not supported.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1320, Failures: 0,

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nN.A.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nImplement double-checked locking in AssignmentMetadataStore to improve method performance. After the first call to initialize, the subsequent calls to getBaseline and getBestPossibleAssignment don't need to obtain the lock.\r\n\r\nDouble-checked locking:\r\nThis is a common pattern to reduce the overhead of obtaining lock, there is no need to synchronize on the instance if the variable has been created. See https://www.baeldung.com/java-singleton-double-checked-locking and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17164454/why-double-checked-locking-is-25-faster-in-joshua-bloch-effective-java-example\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nCI test passed\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n[info] ./helix-core/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 1319, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5,894.718 s - in TestSuite\r\n[info] ./helix-lock/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 11, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 57.5 s - in TestSuite\r\n[info] ./recipes/rsync-replicated-file-system/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.341 s - in TestSuite\r\n[info] ./recipes/distributed-lock-manager/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.4[9](https://github.com/apache/helix/actions/runs/3517363929/jobs/5895050688#step:6:10)6 s - in TestSuite\r\n[info] ./recipes/rabbitmq-consumer-group/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.477 s - in TestSuite\r\n[info] ./recipes/task-execution/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.485 s - in TestSuite\r\n[info] ./recipes/service-discovery/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.617 s - in TestSuite\r\n[info] ./metrics-common/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.304 s - in TestSuite\r\n[info] ./helix-view-aggregator/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 15, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: [10](https://github.com/apache/helix/actions/runs/3517363929/jobs/5895050688#step:6:11)2.9 s - in TestSuite\r\n[info] ./helix-rest/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 209, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 157.102 s - in TestSuite\r\n[info] ./helix-common/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.287 s - in TestSuite\r\n[info] ./zookeeper-api/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 67, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: [14](https://github.com/apache/helix/actions/runs/3517363929/jobs/5895050688#step:6:15)1.655 s - in TestSuite\r\n[info] ./metadata-store-directory-common/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 31, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 2.526 s - in TestSuite\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Refactor the `pom.xml` versioning system by a centralized variable\r\n2. Update bump-up script to adapt to the change in item 1\r\n3. Other improvement in the script with more resilient version fetching script\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\nNow `bump-up` and `bump-snapshot` file type have been modified. The script input signature are backward compatible.\r\nAs of now the script is only used manually.\r\n\r\n**Workflow change:**\r\n**For version bump up, now we only need to change the one in `pom.xml` in the root dir.**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-28T22:56:16Z","updated_at":"2022-11-21T22:30:00Z","closed_at":"2022-11-03T18:19:34Z","merged_at":"2022-11-03T18:19:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"0d973dfca84437ac6d74b9d08301876827713156","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2262/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2262/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2262/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/9adb50b6d88be1e7f0cfea58ad69959f58ee15e3","head":{"label":"qqu0127:ci-improve2","ref":"ci-improve2","sha":"9adb50b6d88be1e7f0cfea58ad69959f58ee15e3","user":{"login":"qqu0127","id":19682637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjgyNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19682637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127","html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":444938840,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoU6WA","name":"helix","full_name":"qqu0127/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"qqu0127","id":19682637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjgyNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19682637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127","html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2257\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nImprove unit test stability.\r\n\r\nOnly counting the GitHub CI ran on master branch, it has only 30% success rate in the last 2 months, https://github.com/apache/helix/actions/workflows/Helix-CI.yml. \r\nThis is a serious problem and the test even becomes meaningless without a stable signal. \r\n\r\nThis PR address some (but probably not all) issues in unit test, this includes:\r\n1. Potential race condition fix in test suite\r\n2. Class and language level improvement\r\n3. Remove `ThreadLeakageChecker` and other `System.out.println`\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nCI succeeded 3 times in a row in this PR\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-24T23:08:13Z","updated_at":"2022-10-28T17:01:57Z","closed_at":"2022-10-28T17:01:56Z","merged_at":"2022-10-28T17:01:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"b5928011441a2efd0674339ab5074f60c6583d95","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2255/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2255/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2255/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/363600b402756b32bb399be5c2da3e417a9e74f8","head":{"label":"qqu0127:test2","ref":"test2","sha":"363600b402756b32bb399be5c2da3e417a9e74f8","user":{"login":"qqu0127","id":19682637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjgyNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19682637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127","html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":444938840,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoU6WA","name":"helix","full_name":"qqu0127/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"qqu0127","id":19682637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjgyNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19682637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127","html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127/helix","description":"Mirror
