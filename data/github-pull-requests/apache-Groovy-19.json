could cause a StackOverflowError.  A ManagedReference#finalizeReference method may call ManagedReference#clear on other references as part of the clean up process and #clear in turns calls #removeStallEntries.  This change makes it so that a queue is not re-entered for processing once it has started to be processed.\n\nThis fix is related to PR #219 because that PR fixes the finalization of the ClassInfo instance.  As part of the cleanup a call is made to [ManagedReference#clear](https://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/91406a76c6bf00ac27a102fe5b55362238fa8af5/src/main/org/codehaus/groovy/reflection/ClassInfo.java#L196)  which in turn calls [removeStallEntries](https://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/91406a76c6bf00ac27a102fe5b55362238fa8af5/src/main/org/codehaus/groovy/util/ManagedReference.java#L49).\n\nAn option might be to remove the call to removeStallEntries from ManagedReference#clear and that is what was done in PR #219.  But it may be difficult to always guarantee no recursive calls in the Managed classes in which case having a guard in place removes the need of the managed classes from having to worry about it.\n","created_at":"2016-03-23T05:49:06Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T03:14:47Z","closed_at":"2016-05-03T03:09:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4835bf8a3f51589ffb8c33c7daafb4b14d4f6c87","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/298/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/298/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/298/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/7f206909e5ee01f52e1b46f8ba847ce995ca95fa","head":{"label":"jwagenleitner:refmanager","ref":"refmanager","sha":"7f206909e5ee01f52e1b46f8ba847ce995ca95fa","user":{"login":"jwagenleitner","id":97695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner","html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":36817367,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjgxNzM2Nw==","name":"groovy","full_name":"jwagenleitner/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwagenleitner","id":97695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner","html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner/groovy","description":"Mirror

two— notes mostly copied from the first Pull request.\n\nThis commit adds a first revision `:grab` command to the Groovy Shell.\n\n@tkruse Sorry— I know @PascalSchumacher was asking me to fork from your fork, but I couldn't quite square that circle.  So I created a new branch, and added you as a collaborator (you should be able to force push here, so you can rebase the commits if you like, as well).\n\nIn any case, we should be able to see some diffs here and at least critique the approach.  I've tested it, and it does appear to work well.\n\ndo not like: The only reliable way I could find to send a message to the existing `ImportCommand` was to invoke property changes (to which it's registered as a listener).  We could make `ImportCommand` open by registering another type of event listener, but this seems like overkill to me.\n\nI did add the bit that verifies that the import completion property has been set before sending the disable/enable events (to force the reload).\n\nTwo changes: I removed an unneeded package specification, and replaced the completer (which gives the user a nice ' ' following the command, but doesn't suggest files as completions for `:grab`.\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\nCheers,\nJake\n","created_at":"2016-03-08T07:50:31Z","updated_at":"2016-09-06T19:14:14Z","closed_at":"2016-05-09T18:29:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"78ece6f68cedce1789fd8725baea150abad374a0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/286/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/286/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/286/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/2f7d7056cdc6b63c87ab5effbf6f7a66dc713277","head":{"label":"Dispader:add_grab_command","ref":"add_grab_command","sha":"2f7d7056cdc6b63c87ab5effbf6f7a66dc713277","user":{"login":"Dispader","id":2664155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjQxNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2664155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader","html_url":"https://github.com/Dispader","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52749823,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1Mjc0OTgyMw==","name":"groovy","full_name":"Dispader/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Dispader","id":2664155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjQxNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2664155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader","html_url":"https://github.com/Dispader","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Dispader/groovy","description":"Mirror

commit adds a first revision `:grab` command to the Groovy Shell.\n\n@tkruse Sorry— I know @PascalSchumacher was asking me to fork from your fork, but I couldn't quite square that circle.  So I created a new branch, and added you as a collaborator (you should be able to force push here, so you can rebase the commits if you like, as well).\n\nIn any case, we should be able to see some diffs here and at least critique the approach.  I've tested it, and it does appear to work well.\n\ndo not like: The only reliable way I could find to send a message to the existing `ImportCommand` was to invoke property changes (to which it's registered as a listener).  We could make `ImportCommand` open by registering another type of event listener, but this seems like overkill to me.\n\nI did add the bit that verifies that the import completion property has been set before sending the disable/enable events (to force the reload).\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\nCheers,\nJake\n","created_at":"2016-03-08T07:14:11Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T17:29:36Z","closed_at":"2016-03-08T07:31:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e34d2001a837dd81fb401900260ff270b2a7cc7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/285/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/285/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/285/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/a4f247b379c5446ddcedb75fc226f22606aec0c6","head":{"label":"Dispader:grab_command","ref":"grab_command","sha":"a4f247b379c5446ddcedb75fc226f22606aec0c6","user":{"login":"Dispader","id":2664155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjQxNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2664155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader","html_url":"https://github.com/Dispader","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52749823,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1Mjc0OTgyMw==","name":"groovy","full_name":"Dispader/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Dispader","id":2664155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjQxNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2664155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader","html_url":"https://github.com/Dispader","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dispader/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Dispader/groovy","description":"Mirror

there,\n\nwhat I basically want to do is this:\n\n``` diff\n-@Target({ElementType.FIELD})\n+@Target({ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.METHOD})\n public @interface Delegate {\n```\n\nso that I can\n\n``` groovy\n@Delegate\nFoo getSomeFoo() {\n    // calcuate foo here\n}\n```\n\nI rewrote the AST transform and put a lot of the FieldNode-specific context into a simple struct-like object (this rework is what makes the diff look so big, although it's just prepending `delegate.`). I then fill this object either with the field's data or the method's data. The actual code generation is not changed at all, except for the actual \"getter\", i.e. a field access or a method invocation.\n\nHowever, I'm having trouble generating the correct AST. Currently the decompiled class looks like this:\n\n``` groovy\n  @Delegate\n  public DelegateFoo getStrategy() {\n    // some stuff that works okay\n  }\n\n  public Object foo()\n  {\n    return ((DelegateFoo)getProperty(\"getStrategy\")).foo(); return null;\n  }\n```\n\nBut there is no _property_ named `getStrategy`, the property is named `strategy` with a _method_ `getStrategy`. Yet I struggle to generate the correct expression to actually call the method as a method. Could someone please give me a hint?\n\nBest regards\n","created_at":"2016-02-20T22:01:13Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T08:33:09Z","closed_at":"2016-04-22T08:30:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f3cec1c4dfcfb807b94fc5b1ceb76ff6a82c9b0f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/265/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/265/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/265/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/8de5d6ef175165e0bfa46b918910ef73843619ea","head":{"label":"oreissig:delegate-to-getter","ref":"delegate-to-getter","sha":"8de5d6ef175165e0bfa46b918910ef73843619ea","user":{"login":"oreissig","id":4244988,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNDQ5ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4244988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oreissig","html_url":"https://github.com/oreissig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oreissig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oreissig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oreissig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oreissig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oreissig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oreissig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oreissig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oreissig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oreissig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1c001704a2ec3bd1a1ded612b9ae645dee7ad2af","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34039690,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDAzOTY5MA==","name":"groovy","full_name":"apache/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy","description":"Apache

is the default scripting language in Elasticsearch, used to evaluate custom expressions. In Elasticsearch 2.0 we introduced the Java security manager as a key component to secure our software. We spent a lot of effort on getting Groovy to run under the security manager with a conservative set of permissions. We have currently hit a road block with the `suppressAccessCheck` which allows suppressing the standard language access checks and expose information that would normally be unavailable to malicious code. Unfortunately, not providing this permission to Groovy breaks the use of Groovy closures in our scripts.\n\nThe reason is that in the Groovy framework:\n- Closures are generated as package private classes.\n- Access to closures is cached by the Groovy runtime using the class `CachedMethod`.\n\nInvoking a closure thus fails without the `suppressAccessCheck` permission as the class of the closure is package private but accessed from the Groovy runtime class `CachedMethod` in the `org.codehaus.groovy.reflection` package.\n\nThis one-line PR changes the access modifier of the classes generated for Groovy closures from package-private to public.\n","created_at":"2016-01-25T17:29:52Z","updated_at":"2016-02-09T06:49:00Z","closed_at":"2016-02-09T06:49:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e1a5c592402fae8fa123f6536270bb341aeb0d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/248/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/248/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/248/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/fae9590785437a411f19791ce51e7b594d954ed7","head":{"label":"ywelsch:fix/package-private-closures","ref":"fix/package-private-closures","sha":"fae9590785437a411f19791ce51e7b594d954ed7","user":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50363895,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDM2Mzg5NQ==","name":"groovy","full_name":"ywelsch/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ywelsch","id":3718355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTgzNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3718355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch","html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywelsch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ywelsch/groovy","description":"Mirror

reviewing each commit separately.  The first commit I think is fairly safe and addresses the issue reported.  The others I'm a little less sure about.\n\n863247f - main fix is ensuring that `localTh.remove()` (changed from `localTh.set(null)`) is always called even if an exception occurs.  Did some refactoring by pulling out the code used to update dependencies and the script cache.  Even though some changes have been made to the ThreadLocal's in this class since that JIRA, the problem remains because `set(null)` will not be called if `super.parseClass` throws.  I think this is a fairly safe change.\n\ndbfa026- If we always clean up the ThreadLocal by calling remove, I think things can be simplified by removing the `WeakReference` holder and synchronized `getLocalData` method.\n\nc32722a- Since `super.parseClass` is synchronized and the other code in that method just updates thread confined (ThreadLocal) data and ConcurrentHashMap scriptCache, it seemed like that could be done outside of synchronization.  I don't know if there might be a potential problem with ordering of the `scriptCache.put` calls.  However, if it is supposed to be synchronized, then I'm not sure a ThreadLocal is needed since that would mean all access to the ThreadLocal is synchronized.  In that case why not just have a `private LocalData localData;` field and set it with a `new LocalData()` each time `parseClass` is called?\n\n**UNIT TEST NOTE**: I'm not sure how good the added test methods are.  They were helpful in showing the issue before the changes (commit 863247f).  However, they might be brittle since they rely on poking into package-private/private
