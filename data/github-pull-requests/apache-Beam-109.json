PR is a continuous work for https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15510.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are 2 Coders for Metadata: default one: `org.apache.beam.sdk.io.fs.MetadataCoder` and enhanced one `org.apache.beam.sdk.io.fs.MetadataCoderV2`, the last can also decode-encode `lastModifiedMillis` and it is done in a new coder in order to support backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nThis will be hard to maintain, we will need to create a new coder for any new field that will be added to `Metadata`.\r\n\r\nSo, as suggested in this comment: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15510#issuecomment-928390587, I came up with new generic coder : `MetadataDynamicCoder`.\r\n\r\n`MetadataDynamicCoder` can decode/encode any new fields added to `Metadata` by sending getter, setter and coder.\r\n\r\nFor example creating coder for `lastModifiedMillis`:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\n new MetadataDynamicCoder()\r\n        .withCoderForField(\r\n            VarLongCoder.of(),\r\n            Metadata::lastModifiedMillis,\r\n            Metadata.Builder::setLastModifiedMillis);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI chose to get explicit getter/setter to avoid reflection which has bad impact on performance.\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-10T08:45:39Z","updated_at":"2023-06-27T12:45:25Z","closed_at":"2023-06-27T12:45:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9630f767a3ca2583b3ee4849f20a21694d33462b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"pabloem","id":1301740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDE3NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1301740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem","html_url":"https://github.com/pabloem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":974794430,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzQ3OTQ0MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1836391716,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM2MzkxNzE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/java","name":"java","color":"001cf2","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/15699/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/15699/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/15699/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/35d806bb15f530334ebadb14da914d33a0374551","head":{"label":"brachi-wernick:add-metadata-dynamic-coder","ref":"add-metadata-dynamic-coder","sha":"35d806bb15f530334ebadb14da914d33a0374551","user":{"login":"brachi-wernick","id":3658085,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTgwODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3658085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick","html_url":"https://github.com/brachi-wernick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":406507474,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDY1MDc0NzQ=","name":"beam","full_name":"brachi-wernick/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brachi-wernick","id":3658085,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTgwODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3658085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick","html_url":"https://github.com/brachi-wernick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brachi-wernick/beam","description":"Apache

about clearing out old docker images and unlocking the gpg signing\r\nkey.\r\n\r\n- With the Docker images, it was using an older pip version with an older dependency resolution algorithm, so the `pip check` afterwards failed. Technically we should probably be aiming at a specific image version, but I'm not familiar enough.\r\n- When I run `git tag -s` it doesn't prompt for a key passphrase, but just prints out an error. So unlocking the key first is necessary. I haven't found another workaround.\r\n\r\nR: @ibzib \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

general the multi-language documentation just links directly to external.py which is not very helpful for end users:\r\n1.

a deamon thread guarantees that the lull operations are checked with fixed time interval instead of relying on trigger of runner process_bundle_progress request (which may not be happening frequently as needed if no work split is intended).\r\nCode has been moved from sdk worker to the worker status handler since all logic of printing thread dump is also there. Removed full thread dump logging since it is often unreadable in logs plus there are other alternatives to get pretty print full thread dumps such as requesting sdk_status page from runner.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

errorprone warnings listed here:\r\n\r\n- **AssignmentToMock**: Fields annotated with /@Mock/ should not be manually assigned to.\r\n- **AnnotateFormatMethod**: Annotate method with @FormatMethod. Doing so gives compile-time rather than run-time protection against malformed format strings.\r\n- **AutoValueFinalMethods**: Make toString(), hashCode() and equals() final in AutoValue classes, so it is clear to readers that AutoValue is not overriding them.\r\n- **BadImport**: Importing nested classes/static methods/static fields with commonly-used names can make code harder to read, because it may not be clear from the context exactly which type is being referred to. Qualifying the name with that of the containing class can make the code clearer.\r\n- **BigDecimalLiteralDouble**: new BigDecimal(double) loses precision in this case.\r\n- **JodaToSelf**: Use of Joda-Time's DateTime.toDateTime(), Duration.toDuration(), Instant.toInstant(), Interval.toInterval(), and Period.toPeriod() are not allowed.\r\n- **MathAbsoluteRandom**: Math.abs does not always give a positive result. Consider other methods for positive random numbers.\r\n- **UnusedMethod**: The presence of an unused method may indicate a bug. This check highlights private methods which are unused and can be safely removed without considering the impact on other source files.\r\n- **UnnecessaryParentheses**: These grouping parentheses are unnecessary; it is unlikely the code will be misinterpreted without them.\r\n\r\nFor reference https://errorprone.info/bugpatterns\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Added an additional beam_sql option to specify a runner.\r\n2. Added a sql_chain module to track chained beam_sql magics and produce\r\n   pipelines for execution when a non-direct runner is specified.\r\n3. Added logic to load schemas defined in main session without relying\r\n   on save_main_session that might fail.\r\n4. Added a OptionsForm class and DataflowOptionsForm subclass to guide\r\n   users through pipeline options configuration in notebooks.\r\n5. Removed is_namedtuple utility and honor the Beam common utility\r\n   match_is_named_tuple. Note dill does not preserve __annotations__\r\n   across multiple main sessions. Added a workaround until cloudpickle\r\n   replaces dill in Beam.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

It has the benefit of amortizing the overhead\r\nof managing and setting up VMs across multiple worker processes.\r\n\r\nThe notion of \"siblings\" is introduced, because the container needs\r\nto be started up with an explicit worker id, which needs to be\r\nprovided to identify itself to the runner for retrieval of provisioning\r\ninformation.  The runner can then respond with any number of additional,\r\nworker ids that indicate identical workers should be started up with\r\nthis same provisioning information.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is partially related to BEAM-7746, and partially a bugfix caught by typehints.\r\n\r\nWe can see here that `delayed_applications` is supposed to be a `List[Tuple[Operation, SplitResultResidual]]`: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/dc4a6a92c0ca31268352fbe12d8399c69dc1caf9/sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/worker/bundle_processor.py#L1009-L1012\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/dc4a6a92c0ca31268352fbe12d8399c69dc1caf9/sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/worker/bundle_processor.py#L1070-L1078\r\n\r\nBut `DoOperation` is appending a `Tuple[Operation, **Iterable**[SplitResultResidual]]`. \r\n\r\nThis PR flattens the `Iterable[SplitResultResidual]`. It also modifies `SimpleInvoker.invoke_process` to match the signature in the parent, `DoFnInvoker.invoke_process`.\r\n\r\n\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance status (on master

versions of functions in the beam package should match the APIs of their non-Try counterparts, other than returning an error.\r\nThat TryCrossLanguage didn't is an oversight. Given the experimental state, this breaking change seems relatively safe, and most usage should be directed through `beam.CrossLanguage` anyway.\r\n\r\nMain functional change is to pre-set coders on the outbound types incase they are needed later by cross language expansion. Real output pcollections are generated against the returned MultiEdge.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

up on discussion from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12628, this changes the default value of AvroCoder#useReflectApi to `true`. This means that by default, avro string fields will get decoded as `CharSequence`s backed by `java.lang.String`s not `org.apache.avro.util.Utf8`s. This matches Beam's behavior prior to version 2.30.\r\n\r\ncc @RyanSkraba , @udim \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
