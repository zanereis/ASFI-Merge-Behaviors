instances of manual runs are usually drawn without borders. However, when a task instance has `null` state, it blends into the background without a border. In this case, drawing a border makes sense, but draw it at reduced opacity to distinguish it from scheduled runs.\r\n\r\nTask instances with `undefined` state were previously always drawn with full-opacity borders because `external_trigger` for these task instances was `undefined`. This has been fixed, so these task instances are now drawn with borders and the proper opacity, depending on whether they are part of manual or scheduled runs.\r\n\r\nCommon task instance properties are now defined in a single place, and `external_trigger` is included as a common property so that it will not be `undefined` as described above.\r\n\r\nFixes #16877.\r\n\r\nScreenshots:\r\n\r\n1.

tests take an excessively long time to run when you run a subset of the tests locally.

FileProcessorHandler is instantiated once and assigned a\r\nFileHandler to write logs to files named based on context.\r\n\r\nApparently there are cases where single FileHandler can switch\r\ncontexts

Top-Level best practices were a little misleading.

From Slack discussion it seems that it is not\r\nobvious at all what are the best ways to handle that so two\r\nalternatives were presented with generating a meta-data file\r\nand generating an importable python code containing the meta-data.\r\n\r\nDuring that change, I noticed also, that config sections and\r\nconfig variables were not sorted - which made it very difficult to\r\nsearch for them in the index. All the config variables are now\r\nsorted so the references to the righ sections/variables make much\r\nmore sense now.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Issue:\r\nClear task instances endpoint can clear all DAG runs of all DAGs when no task instances match the parameters given in the request body and reset_dag_runs is true.\r\nAll DAG runs lose information of their start_date and end_date because of this and it also causes delay to launch new instances until the scheduler re-marks all DAG runs to failed/success when max_active_dag_runs is a low number.\r\n\r\n## Cause:\r\n\r\nairflow/api_connexion/endpoints/task_instance_endpoint.py: post_clear_task_instances function\r\n```python\r\ntask_instances = dag.clear(dry_run=True, dag_bag=current_app.dag_bag, **data)\r\nif not dry_run:\r\n    clear_task_instances(\r\n        task_instances, session, dag=dag, dag_run_state=State.RUNNING if reset_dag_runs else False\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n`dag.clear()` returns a SQLAlchemy Query object. If no task instances match the request body, an empty query object is stored in task_instances. This object is passed to clear_task_instances that expects a list and not a query object.\r\n\r\nIn airflow/models/taskinstance.py: clear_task_instances function:\r\n```python\r\n    if dag_run_state is not False and tis:\r\n        from airflow.models.dagrun import DagRun  # Avoid circular import\r\n\r\n        dates_by_dag_id = defaultdict(set)\r\n        for instance in tis:\r\n            dates_by_dag_id[instance.dag_id].add(instance.execution_date)\r\n\r\n        drs = (\r\n            session.query(DagRun)\r\n            .filter(\r\n                or_(\r\n                    and_(DagRun.dag_id == dag_id, DagRun.execution_date.in_(dates))\r\n                    for dag_id, dates in dates_by_dag_id.items()\r\n                )\r\n            )\r\n            .all()\r\n        )\r\n```\r\nSince tis is an empty Query object and not an empty list, [], the if condition is satisfied and drs is initialized which sets all DAG runs to running state. The snippet inside `or_()` evaluates to `None` as there are zero ti objects in tis. So `drs = (session.query(DagRun).all())`.\r\n\r\n## Fix:\r\nPassing `task_instances.all()` to `clear_task_instances()` will pass an empty list and restrict the if block from running. Tested in local breeze environment and this fixes the issue.\r\n\r\n## An Example:\r\n\r\n### Before Clear API was called:\r\n#### A sample DAG tutorial and its runs:\r\n![before_clear_dag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22529841/131664830-fb134ad2-1d3d-4214-99fd-bcbcd10fe392.PNG)\r\n#### Some example dags

http://localhost:28080/api/v1/dags/tutorial/clearTaskInstances (on Breeze env)\r\nBody: `reset_dag_runs` is `true` and `start_date` is a future date and hence no task instances will match the filters. \r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"dry_run\": false,\r\n    \"start_date\": \"2021-10-30T00:00:00+00:00\",\r\n    \"task_ids\": [\"print_date\"],\r\n    \"only_failed\": false,\r\n    \"reset_dag_runs\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### After Clear API was called:\r\n#### DAG tutorial with all its runs

tests were actually just testing the hook again (by checking the\ncommand executed) but were asserting nothing about the CSV passed to the\nhook.\n\nThis change makes the operator tests check the logic in the operator and\nno longer tests the hook code again.\n\n`test_mysql_to_hive_verify_loaded_values` was removed as since we\nremoved Java/a real hive CLI from our tests this has only been testing\nour mock, not the real code.\n\n\n<!--\nThank you for contributing!

very much for all the work that has gone into v2 of `KubernetesPodOperator`!\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes two small changes (one for documentation, one to a log message in `PodLauncher`), which I think might help others in debugging task failures when using this operator.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nIn my recent experience with `KubernetesPodOperator` (using `airflow` 2.1.0), I've found that for some classes of issues which cause a task to fail, it can be difficult to diagnose them from only the information in the Airflow UI.\r\n\r\nFor problems where kubernetes is able to create a pod but one or more of its containers fails to start, I've found that the task logs in the Airflow UI look something like this:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n[WARN] Pod not yet started: some-pod-amhk4t\r\n[WARN] Pod not yet started: some-pod-amhk4t\r\n[WARN] Pod not yet started: some-pod-amhk4t\r\n...\r\n...\r\npackages/airflow/providers/cncf/kubernetes/utils/pod_launcher.py\", line 131, in start_pod\r\n    raise AirflowException(\"Pod took too long to start\")\r\nairflow.exceptions.AirflowException: Pod took too long to start\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy first thought seeing that log message was \"oh ok maybe image pulling is taking a while and I just need to set a higher timeout\". My second thought was \"ok..'too long' according to what configuration?\".\r\n\r\nI've found that the Airflow task logs can look like that for any of the following issues:\r\n\r\n* referencing a secret that doesn't exist in the target namespace\r\n* requesting an `image` that your pod isn't authorized to pull (e.g., it's in a private repository and you failed to specify `imagePullSecrets`)\r\n* referencing a volume that does not exist\r\n\r\nIn these cases, diagnosing the issue requires going directly to kubernetes to get the pod events.\r\n\r\nI hope that the changes in this PR might save others some debugging time in the future.\r\n\r\nThanks very much for your time and consideration.","created_at":"2021-08-31T21:08:54Z","updated_at":"2021-10-12T21:25:38Z","closed_at":"2021-10-12T21:19:49Z","merged_at":"2021-10-12T21:19:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"c8b86e69e49e330ab2f551358a6998d5800adb9a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2458345138,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDU4MzQ1MTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/okay%20to%20merge","name":"okay

currently generated token is generated only once and is valid for 15 minutes, so when the task is longer, the operation will fail. \r\nI added support for refreshing credentials with [client-go credential plugins](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#client-go-credential-plugins), so a new token is fetched every time it expires. I wrote an `airflow/providers/amazon/aws/utils/eks_get_token.py` script for this, which is similar to `aws eks get-token`, but all supports authentication protocols natively supported by Airflow including Secret backend, Google Credential using Web Identity Federation, HTTP SPEGO, SAML.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Secrets Backend are instantiated during configuration, not\r\nall Airlfow packages are yet imported, because they need Secret\r\nBackends. We have a weird cyclical relation between models,\r\nconfiguration and settins which forces us to be extra careful\r\naround configuration, settings and backends.\r\n\r\nIn this case top-level import of Connections by the Vault Secret\r\nBackend triggered cyclic import problem (importing airflow models\r\nrequire configuration to be fully loaded and initialized) but then\r\nit could not be initialized because models needed to be imported\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to move Connections to be locally imported.\r\n\r\nFound during testing in #17922 \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhile trying to fix test failures in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/17121 I noticed a bug in the way that ImportErrors are displayed when users don't have access to view all DAGs.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically in this piece of code:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/0a68588479e34cf175d744ea77b283d9d78ea71a/airflow/www/views.py#L611-L692\r\n\r\nThe list of filenames that we use to conditionally display ImportErrors (`dag_filenames`) is itself filtered to only active DAGs, then paginated and then potentially filtered to only paused or not-paused DAGs. \r\n\r\nAs a result, a user without read access to all DAGs may see a different subset of import errors when they:\r\n - switch pages\r\n - filter on paused, non-paused or all DAGs\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\nI made a DAG and a user which only had access to view that DAG.\r\n\r\nI introduced an importError in the DAG and it appeared in the UI (as expected):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16950874/131423826-f86ea5d1-9bc2-403a-950e-5505c5b7dbf3.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, when I switched to the `paused` tab, the ImportError disappeared:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16950874/131424140-c5855dd3-95ea-4f26-ac36-50104e76c245.png)\r\n\r\n## The Fix\r\n\r\nIf a user doesn't have permission to view all DAGs, then we can compute the list of ImportErrors to be displayed by joining ImportErrors with visible DAGs.

were a number of deprecation warnings when just importing\r\ncertain providers or their examples. Some of them came from still\r\nusing 1.10 classes, some from using still `apply_defaults` and\r\nsome from badly implemented fallback mechanism to support\r\nbackwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nThis has all been fixed and our documentation generation step\r\nfor providers in CI will also fail in case there are some new\r\nDeprecationWarnings generated, which means that they will have\r\nto be fixed before merging.\r\n\r\nWhile checking that we found that BigQuery table_resource new\r\napproach had some inconsistencies when passing new `table_resource`\r\nparameters. Some deprecated parameters should be None by default,\r\notherwise you'd have to explicitly set them to None when\r\n`table_resource` is set but when it is not set, the backwards\r\ncompatible behaviour is maintained - the parameters get the same.\r\ndefault values set.\r\n\r\nSeveral deprecation warnings had wrong stack-level - this has been\r\nfixed as well.\r\n\r\nThe \"legitimate\" warnings are now filtered out and they are only\r\nfiltered out for the appropriate modules we know they are generated\r\nfrom or in case the warnings result from direct import of the\r\ndeprecated module.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#17495, #14677, #14758\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the first operator and sensor to integrate with Azure Data Factory:\r\n- `AzureDataFactoryRunPipelineOperator` will execute a given pipeline within a given data factory with a configurable option to wait for the pipeline execution completion\r\n- `AzureDataFactoryPipelineRunStatusSensor` will check the status of a specific pipeline execution\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the connection form for the Azure Data Factory type has been updated to add explicit values currently embedded within the classic `Extras` field.\r\n\r\nOther changes made as part of this PR:\r\n- Small update has been made to a few function signatures within the `AzureDataFactoryHook` to annotate the correct type.\r\n- Update the connection ID name in the `AzureDataFactoryHook`\r\n- Updated the import path for `AzureDataFactoryHook` to comply with AIP-21\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

we fail long running SchedulerJob instances(LocalTaskJob) with no recent heartbeat\r\nin reset_and_adopt_orphaned_tasks method of the Scheduler. Sometimes, this leads to the _find_zombies\r\nmethod of the DAG file process manager running TaskCallbacks. This is how it happens:\r\n\r\nWhen the scheduler dies and we reset task instances or adopt, we do not reset the ti.job_id and the\r\nnew SchedulerJob will create instances(LocalTaskJob) to run the new reset tasks. When the old job\r\nwhich the task instances still has the job_id, has not heartbeated for long, the adopt_or_reset_orphaned\r\ntasks will kill those jobs and subsequently or the _find_zombies method will find the tasks with the old jobID\r\nand send a TaskCallback which will now fail the tasks being run by new schedulerjob instances\r\n\r\nThis was fixed by first, setting  ti.job_id to None\r\nThis helps to avoid clashing with the _find_zombies method which is now made to only act on jobs that are not\r\nrunning and are also not heartbeating but the task is running.\r\n\r\nIn a situation where the _find_zombies method and adopt_or_reset_orphaned_task method run at the same time,\r\nthere would be conflict but now there won't be conflicts because _find_zombies only act on failed jobs with\r\nrunning tasks and adopt_or_reset_orphaned_tasks kill jobs\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/16023\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

to the [API reference](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.clusters#Cluster), the `initial_node_count` should not be used when you are configuring `node_pools` because you specify the `initial_node_count` within the `node_pools` object.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds logic allowing either `initial_node_count` OR `node_pools` and updates test cases. I also refactored the test to make it more human readable because boolean logic makes me dizzy sometimes 😄
