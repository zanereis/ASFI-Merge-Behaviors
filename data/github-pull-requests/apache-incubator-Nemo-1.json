<code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> to further address CVE-2020-8908 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/4011\">#4011</a>) and CVE-2023-2976 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/2575\">#2575</a>). (feb83a1c8f)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While CVE-2020-8908 was officially closed when we deprecated <code>Files.createTempDir</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v30.0\">Guava 30.0</a>, we've heard from users that even recent versions of Guava have been listed as vulnerable in <em>other</em> databases of security vulnerabilities. In response, we've reimplemented the method (and the very rarely used <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> class, which had a similar issue) to eliminate the insecure behavior entirely. This change could technically affect users in a number of different ways (discussed under &quot;Incompatible changes&quot; below), but in practice, the only problem users are likely to encounter is with Windows. If you are using those APIs under Windows, you should skip 32.0.0 and go straight to <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a> which fixes the problem. (Unfortunately, we didn't think of the Windows problem until after the release. And while we <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava#important-warnings\">warn that <code>common.io</code> in particular may not work under Windows</a>, we didn't intend to regress support.) Sorry for the trouble.</p>\n<h4>Incompatible changes</h4>\n<p>Although this release bumps Guava's major version number, it makes <strong>no binary-incompatible changes to the <code>guava</code> artifact</strong>.</p>\n<p>One change could cause issues for Widows users, and a few other changes could cause issues for users in more usual situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The new implementations of <code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6535\">throw an exception under Windows</a>.</strong> This is fixed in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a>. Sorry for the trouble.</li>\n<li>This release makes a binary-incompatible change to a <code>@Beta</code> API in the <strong>separate artifact</strong> <code>guava-testlib</code>. Specifically, we changed the return type of <code>TestingExecutors.sameThreadScheduledExecutor</code> to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. The old return type was a package-private class, which caused the Kotlin compiler to produce warnings. (dafaa3e435)</li>\n<li>This release <em>adds</em> two methods to the Android flavor of Guava: <code>Invokable.getAnnotatedReturnType()</code> and <code>Parameter.getAnnotatedType()</code>. Those methods do not work under an Android VM; we added them only to help our tests of the Android flavor (since we also run those tests under a JRE). Android VMs tolerate such methods as long as the app does not call them or perform reflection on them, and builds tolerate them because of our new Proguard configurations (discussed below). Thus, we expect no impact to most users. However, we could imagine build problems for users who have set up their own build system for the Android flavor of Guava. Please report any problems so that we can judge how safely we might be able to add other methods to the Android flavor in the future, such as APIs that use Java 8 classes like <code>Stream</code>.

(truncated)</p>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/blob/dev/RELEASE_PLAN.md\">nuxt's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Release Plan</h2>\n<p>Starting with version <code>v2.4</code>, Nuxt will adhere to a formalized release plan (as good as possible).\nAlso, an end of life for older major versions is defined with this document.</p>\n<h3>Major versions (3.x -&gt; 4.0)</h3>\n<p>Nuxt major releases are planned every <strong>6 months</strong>. This depends on a few factors though:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If there are no breaking changes waiting for a release, no new major version will be published. Instead, another minor one will be released</li>\n<li>In case of unexpected major updates of important dependencies like Vue, Webpack, and so on, major versions might be released <em>earlier</em> than planned</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The goal is to provide a <strong>migration guide</strong> for each major version as well, as escape hatches, so existing code\nwon't &quot;just break&quot;.</p>\n<h3>Minor versions (2.1 -&gt; 2.2)</h3>\n<p>The release cycle for Nuxt minor versions is roughly <strong>4 weeks</strong>.</p>\n<p>Three of the four weeks will be used for actual <strong>feature implementations</strong> while the last week will be used for\n<strong>testing, fixing bugs and thorough audits</strong>.</p>\n<p>That also means a <em>feature freeze</em> for the next minor version after these three weeks.\nFeatures that aren't ready will be moved to the next cycle. &quot;Waiting&quot; for features\n(for a longer time) will be avoided as good as possible to keep releases lean, concise, predictable and digestible.</p>\n<h3>Patch releases (2.2.3 -&gt; 2.2.4)</h3>\n<p>The last patch releases were mostly <em>bundled</em> fixes or single <em>hotfixes</em>.\nIn the future, fixes will be released <strong>as soon as possible</strong> after the actual PR/commit so people won't have to switch to <code>nuxt-edge</code> for bugfixes. This should improve the stability of Nuxt.</p>\n<p>Fixes can or will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updates of dependencies (for various reasons, like a &quot;faulty/buggy&quot; dependency or an newer versions that works better with the Nuxt code)</li>\n<li>Fixes for our code</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bugfixes for upcoming features won't be ported of course.</p>\n<h3>Edge Release Channel</h3>\n<p>After experimenting with <code>nuxt-edge</code> releases in the last time, the decision to do <strong>nightly releases</strong> for now instead of\nreleasing a version after <em>each commit</em> was made.</p>\n<h2>End of Life</h2>\n<p>Starting with <code>v2.4</code>, every major Nuxt version will have an <strong>End of Life</strong>.\nPrevious releases will receive security updates and bugfixes <strong>for one year and two weeks</strong>, counted from the first release on.\nAs Nuxt majors are approximately released once every 6 months, this will allow developers to &quot;skip one major version&quot; without being stuck with a broken or unsecure Nuxt dependency.\nThe EOL also applies to the documentation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/commit/d4b9e4b0553bcd617ecbc0b8b76871070b347fcb\"><code>d4b9e4b</code></a> v2.15.8</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/commit/af1d3e9877c3fb88e5ed81bf41b689fd54455f15\"><code>af1d3e9</code></a> chore: skip audit due to outdated lockfile</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/commit/1ccd15191cf90d1fac48978159d3a3ce1d05c7ea\"><code>1ccd151</code></a> fix(vue-app): don't normalise route path if it's valid (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/9460\">#9460</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/commit/af491991eb92c85461eea3d16a47a2cf26cb5481\"><code>af49199</code></a> fix(babel): loose option for babel private-property-in-object (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/9631\">#9631</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/commit/4f370e2043b7731db0e8ef65a4f88431cd8795f3\"><code>4f370e2</code></a> v2.15.7</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/commit/85615a5dc56a343c8be17d9dbfb6d71551c90e36\"><code>85615a5</code></a> fix(vue-app): check whether route exists within nuxt app before replacing (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/9\">#9</a>...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/commit/0eae970e74f1fbf29f400a3178f54061a79bfac2\"><code>0eae970</code></a> chore(release): v2.15.6</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/commit/fc5fb58c856d9506ea2d55cf4f9855d259040411\"><code>fc5fb58</code></a> hotfix: revert feat additions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/commit/cd1fc6277f980366c69a702c3a48e09bf01ce8ad\"><code>cd1fc62</code></a> chore(deps): update ufo to 0.7.4</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/commit/a80ddeee6fa5b19abc07bc8085a379c848724ad9\"><code>a80ddee</code></a> chore(deps): update all non-major dependencies (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/9281\">#9281</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/compare/v1.4.5...v2.15.8\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.22.0</h2>\n<h1>NumPy 1.22.0 Release Notes</h1>\n<p>NumPy 1.22.0 is a big release featuring the work of 153 contributors\nspread over 609 pull requests. There have been many improvements,\nhighlights are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Annotations of the main namespace are essentially complete. Upstream\nis a moving target, so there will likely be further improvements,\nbut the major work is done. This is probably the most user visible\nenhancement in this release.</li>\n<li>A preliminary version of the proposed Array-API is provided. This is\na step in creating a standard collection of functions that can be\nused across application such as CuPy and JAX.</li>\n<li>NumPy now has a DLPack backend. DLPack provides a common interchange\nformat for array (tensor) data.</li>\n<li>New methods for <code>quantile</code>, <code>percentile</code>, and related functions.

[NEMO-478: Implement an Accurate Simulator based on Functional model](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/NEMO/issues/NEMO-478)\r\n\r\n**Major changes:**\r\n-\r\n* Added ```run_beam_simulator.sh``` and  Created ```SimulatorLauncher```to run simulator.\r\n    * In addition to the existing arguments, pass hardware specification including network information through ```-node_json``` argument\r\n* Created ```NetworkSimulator``` and ```ContainerManageSimulator``` to manage node and network specification.\r\n    * ```NetworkSimulator``` manages network bandwidth and latency between nodes. \r\n    * ```ContainerManageSimulator``` manages nodes cpu resources. \r\n* Created ```PlanSimulator``` and  ```StreamingPlanSimulator``` to Emulate on the job level. \r\n    * It manages the size of transferred data between tasks while triggering simulation for ```ExecutorSimulator``` \r\n    *```StreamingPlanSimulator```  has an internal timestamp and iterate cycles until the size of transferred data between tasks reaches equilibrium. \r\n\r\n* Created ```ExecutorSimulator``` and ```TaskHarness``` to Simulate execution of task. \r\n    * ```TaskHarness``` has ```DataFetchSimulator``` and ```WriterSimulator```.\r\n        * ```DataFetchSimulator``` manages the number of tuples that are read from upstream tasks. \r\n        * ```WriterSimulator``` manages the number of tuples to transfer to downstream tasks. \r\n  \r\n**Minor changes to note:**\r\n- \r\n\r\n**Tests for the changes:**\r\n-\r\n* Tested on ubuntu machine\r\n\r\n**Other

[NEMO-466 Dynamic Work Stealing on Nemo for handling skews](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/NEMO/issues/NEMO-466)\r\n\r\n**Major changes:**\r\n- created `WorkStealingStatePass` and `WorkStealingSubSplitPass` to enable annotations related to work stealing.\r\n   - `WorkStealingStatePass` annotates three phases of work stealing process: `DEFAULT`, `SPLIT`, and `MERGE`. These are tagged to the vertex based on the name assigned to beam transform by the user.\r\n   - Sub-tasks are generated in `SPLIT` phase and merged in `MERGE` phase. \r\n   - `WorkStealingSubSplitPass` annotates the number to split the tasks in `SPLIT` phase.\r\n- Added `WorkStealingPolicy`, which executes `WorkStealingPass` and `WorkStealingSubSplitPass` additionally to `DefaultCompositePass`.\r\n- Changed notation of the `task id` and `block id` to differentiate between work stealing tasks and default tasks.\r\n   - `task id`\r\n      - previous: `[stage id] - [task index] - [task attempt]`\r\n      - current: `[stage id] - [task index] - [* or sub index for work stealing tasks] - [task attempt]`\r\n   - `block id`\r\n      - previous: `[runtime edge id] - [producer task index] - [producer task attempt]`\r\n      - current: `[runtime edge id] - [producer task index] -  [producer task sub index] - [producer task attempt]` for blocks generated by work stealing tasks. \r\n\r\n**Minor changes to note:**\r\n- Changed `PipelineTranslator` to read the user tags given to the transform.\r\n- Extended `PlanStateManager` and `BlockInputReader` to manage work stealing tasks and non-split tasks together.\r\n\r\n**Tests for the changes:**\r\n- Added e2e tests to test `WorkStealingPolicy`. Note that in order to execute WorkStealing policy, the application pipeline should provide appropriate splitting and merging strategy.\r\n- Added unit tests to test `WorkStealingCompositePass` which encapsulates `WorkStealingStatePass` and `WorkStealingSubSplitPass`\r\n- Modified `ParentTaskDataFetcherTest` and `TaskExecutorTest`, reflecting the changes in `BlockInputReader`\r\n\r\n**Other comments:**\r\n- This is the PR for the GSoC2021 project.\r\n\r\nCloses #321

[NEMO-472: Fix and Implement Hierarchical Aggregation](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/NEMO/issues/NEMO-472)\r\n\r\n**Major changes:**\r\nContinuing from #318 \r\n- Implemented new stage execution property, TaskIndexToExecutorIDProperty, that stores task allocation information. \r\n  - Information will be stored in runtime, when TaskDispatcher dispatches a task to any executor.\r\n  - It will be used when upstream tasks of partial shuffle communication channel decide where to emit data.\r\n- Implemented data transfer logic on partial shuffle communication channel.\r\n  - Data from each executor must be transferred to nearby executors only.\r\n- Implemented constraint when scheduling intermediate combine stage(the stage consists of intermediate accumulator vertex), so that the tasks are evenly distributed across all node groups. Each group represents physically close nodes.\r\n\r\n**Minor changes to note:**\r\n- None\r\n\r\n**Tests for the changes:**\r\n- Tested on my Mac and ubuntu machine\r\n\r\n**Other comments:**\r\n- Also see #318, which implemented optimization pass that inserts intermediate accumulator vertex.\r\n- [TODO] Currently the implemented scheduling constraint simply distributes tasks in the intermediate combine stage evenly to each executor groups. It is expected to be updated, related to WAN aware scheduling policy.","created_at":"2021-08-16T11:56:45Z","updated_at":"2021-11-01T09:22:00Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"422cf7837ad83627470b42c497778b8a01fee92c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/pulls/319/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/pulls/319/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/issues/319/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/statuses/83a1878f0717454dc7b44162cc948f217d56f73f","head":{"label":"Kangji:472-comm-channel","ref":"472-comm-channel","sha":"83a1878f0717454dc7b44162cc948f217d56f73f","user":{"login":"Kangji","id":11360982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzYwOTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11360982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji","html_url":"https://github.com/Kangji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":368789692,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjg3ODk2OTI=","name":"incubator-nemo","full_name":"Kangji/incubator-nemo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kangji","id":11360982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzYwOTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11360982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji","html_url":"https://github.com/Kangji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kangji/incubator-nemo","description":"Apache

[NEMO-472: Fix and Implement Hierarchical Aggregation](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/NEMO/issues/NEMO-472)\r\n\r\n**Major changes:**\r\n[NEMO-472: Implement Hierarchical Aggregation] aims to add additional intermediate accumulation operator in front of final combine operator that accumulates data among physically nearby containers prior to shuffling across WAN, when needed. It is expected that data aggregation among nearby containers will reduce the data size that must be transferred across WAN. To achieve it, \r\n- Implemented intermediate combine transform\r\n  - Previous Combine.PerKey Transform consisted of 2 steps.\r\n    1. Partial Combine(a.k.a. pre-aggregation): accumulates elements in each containers. Therefore, data transfer across network is not needed in this step.\r\n    2. Final Combine: shuffle all data(hashed by key) and then combine.\r\n  - Additional, and optional step that accumulates the pre-aggregated data partially(only among nearby containers) is implemented and inserted between 1(partial) and 2(final).\r\n  - This new type of transform is only used in intermediate accumulator vertex, which is special type of operator vertex.\r\n- Added new type of communication channel, Partial Shuffle, which represents data transfer from upstream operator to intermediate accumulator vertex. It resembles shuffle, but the difference is that data shuffle occurs only among physically nearby containers.\r\n- Implemented compile time optimization pass that inserts intermediate accumulator vertex, which performs hierarchical aggregation prior to shuffle, only when it is expected to be effective.\r\n- Implemented unit tests.\r\n\r\n**Minor changes to note:**\r\n- None\r\n\r\n**Tests for the changes:**\r\n- Tested on my Mac and ubuntu machine\r\n\r\n**Other comments:**\r\n- Data transfer on partial shuffle communication channel is implemented in #319.\r\n- [TODO] Need more conditions to be implemented to make decision whether applying the pass is effective or not. Current logic is too naive.","created_at":"2021-08-15T06:30:43Z","updated_at":"2021-11-01T08:54:11Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e3f58aecfdda8206b7339dac21a4b9ef895e04ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"taegeonum","id":1371383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzEzODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1371383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taegeonum","html_url":"https://github.com/taegeonum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taegeonum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taegeonum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taegeonum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taegeonum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taegeonum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taegeonum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taegeonum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taegeonum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taegeonum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/pulls/318/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/pulls/318/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/issues/318/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-nemo/statuses/4fbf06bfa17bb2c8aef797222b68cdc0f0fcb1b6","head":{"label":"Kangji:472-intermediate-combine","ref":"472-intermediate-combine","sha":"4fbf06bfa17bb2c8aef797222b68cdc0f0fcb1b6","user":{"login":"Kangji","id":11360982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzYwOTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11360982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji","html_url":"https://github.com/Kangji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":368789692,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjg3ODk2OTI=","name":"incubator-nemo","full_name":"Kangji/incubator-nemo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kangji","id":11360982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzYwOTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11360982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji","html_url":"https://github.com/Kangji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kangji/incubator-nemo","description":"Apache

[NEMO-483: Record Metrics associated with stream processing](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/NEMO/issues/NEMO-483)\r\n\r\n**Major changes:**\r\n-\r\n\r\nTwo types of metric were added. It can degrade performance, So It is recommended to use only for debugging purpose. \r\n\r\nTask periodically record how many data has received\r\n- Record the following metric:\r\n1. the number of processed tuples\r\n2. the size of read serialized bytes \r\n- The recording period can be adjusted through \"stream_metric_period\" argument. the unit is milli second.\r\n- If stream_metric_period is not set, it is disabled. \r\n\r\nFor each task, record traversal time from source vertex. \r\nSource vertex sends latencymark from source vertex \r\n- The latencymark has the following data:\r\n1. Timestamp when it was create. \r\n2. Task id where it created.\r\n3. Task id where it delivered from. task id of upstream task. \r\n- When a latencymark is reached  at any task, It is recorded with the timestamp when it reached at task. \r\n- The period for creating latencymarks can be adjusted through \"latencymark_period\" argument. the unit is milli second. \r\n- If latencymark_period is not set, it is disabled.  \r\n\r\n**Minor changes to note:**\r\n-\r\n**Tests for the changes:**\r\n-\r\n- Tested on ubuntu machine\r\n\r\n**Other comments:**\r\n-\r\n- There is a gap between when the number of processed tuples increased and when the size of read serialized bytes is increased. Because the size of read serialized bytes is increased when the data are received, the number of processed tuples is increased just before it is processed, and data fetchers are working on the multithread environment. \r\n- When increasing the size of read serialized bytes, It is not possible to distinguish whether it is the data to be processed or the watermark, So When the number of processed tuples is 0, the size of read serialized bytes can be not 0. \r\n- If a task read data from local block, because upstream task is in the same node, the size of read serialized data does not increase because the data is not serialized. Instead, isReadNotSerializedData field of StreamMetric indicates whether the task read not serialized data or not.\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses

[NEMO-394: Exchange data via shared memory](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/NEMO/issues/NEMO-394)\r\n\r\n**Major changes:**\r\n- Implemented the LocalInputContext and the LocalOutputContext to enable a pipe output writer and an input reader to exchange data via shared memory when both a parent task and a child task are in the same executor. In such a case, the data transfer doesn't involve data serialization/deserialization.\r\n\r\n**Minor changes to note:**\r\n- Renamed the \"bytetransfer\" package to \"transfer,\" which now also includes LocalTransfer contexts.\r\n \r\n**Tests for the changes:**\r\n- Added the LocalTransferContext test.\r\n- Windowed Word Count IT case\r\n- Measured the latency of processing 160MB data before and after using shared memory. Below are the results.\r\n      - With a single executor, the latency reduced by 87 sec (≈70%) after using shared memory.\r\n      - With two executors, the latency reduced by 30 sec (≈20%) after using shared memory.\r\n \r\nCloses

[NEMO-392: Support combine in streaming] (https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/NEMO/issues/NEMO-392)\r\n\r\n**Major changes:**\r\n- Added GBKTransform class to support stream processing for GroupByKey and Combine.Perkey operation.\r\n     - Each time an element arrives, GBKTransform invokes runner to process a single element and stores its state,       instead of waiting to process it until the time to emit it to downstream.\r\n- Removed GroupByKeyAndWindowDoFnTransform since GBKTransform can support both Combine.Perkey \r\n   and GroupByKeyAndWindow operation.\r\n\r\n**Minor changes to note:**\r\n- N/A\r\n\r\n**Tests for the changes:**\r\n- Added GBKStreamingTransformTest.\r\n\r\n**Other comments:**\r\n- Most of the work is done by TaeGun Um\r\n\r\nCloses

\r\n[NEMO-455: MemoryManager to keep track of remaining storage, execution memory](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/NEMO/issues/NEMO-455)\r\n[NEMO-450: Block status aware Master](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NEMO-450)\r\n[NEMO-449: Runtime Level Caching Mechanism](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NEMO-449)\r\n\r\n**Major changes:**\r\n- Adds MemoryManager that splits the memory in executors to separate pools, execution and storage\r\n- Make BlockOutputWriter write to a temporary vector before data is committed\r\n- Actual write from SizeTrackingVector to a block happens on close, after determining whether the contents of SizeTrackingVector can fit in the current StoragePoolMemory\r\n\r\n\r\n**Minor changes to note:**\r\n- \r\n\r\n**Tests for the changes:**\r\n- Tests for SizeEstimator completed, SizeTrackingVector, MemoryManager still needs to be done\r\n\r\n**Other comments:**\r\n- Large scale distributed testing being done\r\n- can be merged with  pr #297 to create one pr\r\n- The configuration for the size of Storage Memory Pool can be set in JobConf as a factor (ex:0.2) of total Executor Memory

[NEMO-434: Logical DAG modification for Dynamic sampling of task metrics during the execution of a stage](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/NEMO/issues/NEMO-434)\r\n\r\n**Major changes:**\r\n- Added new mechanism for launching runtime pass\r\n   - For runtime passes which need to gather information by itself, use MessageGeneratorVertex and MessageAggregatorVertex\r\n   - For runtime passes which need Metric information, use SignalVertex\r\n- Added SignalVertex and SignalTransform to launch runtime pass without collecting any runtime information\r\n- New Compile time pass for DTS which changes DAG\r\n- New TaskSizeSplitterVertex to distinguish and manage sampled data and the rest in vertex level(extended from LoopVertex)\r\n- Added inserting / deleting TaskSizeSplitterVertex and SignalVertex method in IRDAG\r\n\r\n**Minor changes to note:**\r\n- Changed the name of TriggerVertex to MessageGeneratorVertex. Since the combination of TriggerVertex and MAV triggers runtime pass, not trigger vertex alone, the name 'Trigger' can be misleading.\r\n- erased duplicate assignments in EmptyComponents class\r\n- new methods in LoopVertex\r\n\r\n**Tests for the changes:**\r\n- IRDAGTest and SkewCompositePassTest has been modified by the class name refactoring\r\n- Added new test methods in IRDAGTest regarding TaskSizeSplitterVertex and SignalVertex\r\n\r\n**Other comments:**\r\n\r\nCloses #292

[NEMO-438: Create a Simulator for Simulating an Execution of an Execution Plan](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/NEMO/issues/NEMO-438)\r\n\r\n**Major changes:**\r\n- Implements a SimulationScheduler that schedules a physical plan\r\n- Implements a SimulatedExecutor that acts like an executor\r\n- Refactor components used by both `BatchScheduler` and `SimulationScheduler` to `SchedulerUtils`\r\n\r\n**Minor changes to note:**\r\n- Refactors executor's ResourceSpecification to be able to be accessed in the driver as well\r\n- Enables IRDAG to get the input size of the workload\r\n- Added Job Duration to the Job Metric.\r\n\r\n**Tests for the changes:**\r\n- SimulationSchedulerTest.java tests for the implementations\r\n\r\n**Other comments:**\r\n- None\r\n\r\nCloses

[NEMO-420: OffHeapMemory configuration only supports a single type of executor\r\n](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/NEMO/issues/NEMO-420)\r\n\r\n**Major changes:**\r\n- enabled OffHeapMemory configuration for multiple types of executors\r\n- refactored initialization of MaxOffheapRatio and ExecutorPoisonSec (bind with default value when not existing)\r\n- erased MaxOffheapMb in job configuration and added ExecutorMemoryMb instead to compute size of max off-heap manually if needed\r\n\r\n**Minor changes to note:**\r\n- modified typos (poison from posion)\r\n- when changing test.java files which contain initialization of MemoryPoolAssigner, computed ExecutorMemoryMb using default MaxOffheapRatio\r\n- changed type of MaxOffheapRatio and ExecutorPoisonSec from double, int to Optional Double and Optioinal Integer, respectively\r\n\r\n**Tests for the changes:**\r\n- N/A\r\n\r\n**Other comments:**\r\n- N/A\r\n\r\nCloses #279
