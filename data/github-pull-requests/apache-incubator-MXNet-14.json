For more information, see [here](https://discuss.mxnet.io/t/assertion-error-for-aux-state-when-exporting-model-with-dangling-layer/6549) and [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17970).\r\n\r\n\r\n* fix block.export\r\n\r\n```net.hybridize``` may optimize out some ops. These ops are alive in nn.Block(also nn.HybridBlock), but its names are not contained in symbol's ```arg_names``` list.

is a POC for statically linking to openblas and hiding blas/lapack symbols to avoid the name clashing issue as discussed here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/18855. This is meant as a reference rather for merging\r\n\r\nFor static build (using incubator-mxnet/tools/staticbuild/build.sh), we have https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/18872 to hide all the unwanted symbols, but this might be an overkill. In this pr, I listed explicitly what blas/lapack symbols to hide in the version script (linux only).\r\n\r\nTo friends at intel: I am linking to openblas in this poc, but I think we would need something very similar with mkl: 1. static link, 2. symbol stripping.","created_at":"2020-09-01T20:39:24Z","updated_at":"2021-09-29T23:00:27Z","closed_at":"2021-02-15T19:19:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"66ada633e72aad2b73da3624ff3c29ef31c2bb86","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"leezu","id":946903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu","html_url":"https://github.com/leezu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/19068/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/19068/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/19068/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/3dae02f3e4e04073bf6e7af74b1707f8a3fa5953","head":{"label":"Zha0q1:static_openblas","ref":"static_openblas","sha":"3dae02f3e4e04073bf6e7af74b1707f8a3fa5953","user":{"login":"Zha0q1","id":16669457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjY5NDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16669457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zha0q1","html_url":"https://github.com/Zha0q1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zha0q1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zha0q1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zha0q1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zha0q1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zha0q1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zha0q1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zha0q1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zha0q1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zha0q1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":282007065,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODIwMDcwNjU=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"Zha0q1/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Zha0q1","id":16669457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjY5NDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16669457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zha0q1","html_url":"https://github.com/Zha0q1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zha0q1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zha0q1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zha0q1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zha0q1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zha0q1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zha0q1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zha0q1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zha0q1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zha0q1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Zha0q1/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

type as MxNet is used in mshadow::index_t \r\n- define lapack_index_t to use int64_t as index type only for MKL\r\n- define IndexT to use it in common code for CPU and GPU implementations. This way, when -DUSE_CUDA=1 -DUSE_INT64_TENSOR_SIZE=ON -DUSE_BLAS=mkl are set,  we have 2 different instantiation for GPU and CPU.\r\n- convert the  pivot tensor for det and slodget operators from/to

to this commit, linker version scripts were used to control the set of\r\nvisible symbols. These scripts exported C++ symbols, that do not have a stable\r\nABI and should not have been exported. Instead, use `MXNET_DLL` macro to\r\nannotate the visiblity in the source code and remove the linker version scripts where\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nRefer to \"Deep CMake For Library Authors\" CppCon 2019 talk by Craig Scott for\r\ndetails on the cmake settings.\r\n\r\nSome third-party libraries began relying on the C++ symbols, for example Horovod.\r\nWe need to rewrite their integration to only rely on the C API. These libraries are currently broken in any case, as they assume a different C++ ABI than the one used by the MXNet static build script. We can't change the static build script to adopt a different ABI without dropping support for RHEL7 based systems (see

pr adds large size check for the npx ctc loss operator.\r\n\r\nBecause of the way the current implementation is written, the operator only works when the total size of the input is < 2^31.  I.e. data is of shape (sequence_length, batch_size, alphabet_size), and the product of the tree dimension must < 2^31.\r\n\r\nI closely examined the code and tried to only add the 2^31 upper bound to each of the 3 dimensions and change int->index_t wherever those dimensions are multiplied together, but this turned out to be unpractical since there are ~ 200 ints, ~10 different functions, and several control flow branches. With that effort one might as well refactor the whole thing to support int64 dimensions to begin with.\r\n\r\n@szha what do you think?

Description ##\r\nThis PR improves MXNet support for onnx import and export for newer onnx versions (including the latest, 1.7.0).\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to allow exporting of the most common CV models used and verify inference with the latest onnxruntime (1.4.0).\r\n\r\nWith newer onnx opset versions, the attributes for some operators have been changed to inputs, so most of the work in the two _op_translations.py files relates to converting between attributes and inputs. Updated operator translations between MXNet and onnx as follows:\r\n\r\nExport operators:\r\n- Dropout (Issue #19012)\r\n- Pad\r\n- Clip\r\n- Topk\r\n\r\nImport operators:\r\n- Dropout\r\n- Pad\r\n- Slice\r\n- Clip\r\n- Topk\r\n\r\nThis PR also changes the import and export code to pass an “opset_version” variable which defaults to the latest version supported by the installed onnx module. This variable is used to determine what format to use for onnx conversions.\r\n\r\nThis PR also cherry-picks the following PRs from the master branch:\r\n- fix pooling_convention warning when convert model to onnx #18529\r\n    - Code also modified to use opset_version instead of ONNX version\r\n- ONNX import: use Conv pad attribute for symmetrical padding #18675\r\n\r\nThis PR also updates the CI environments to install the latest version of onnx (1.7.0) and onnxruntime (1.4.0) for testing model export from mxnet and inference using onnxruntime.\r\n\r\nAll onnx unit tests are passing. An additional onnx test has been added in tests/python-pytest/onnx/test_onnxruntime.py which tests the following models (from gluoncv model zoo) for export and inference in onnxruntime:\r\n\r\n- mobilenet1.0\r\n- mobilenet0.75\r\n- mobilenet0.5\r\n- mobilenet0.25\r\n- mobilenetv2_1.0\r\n- mobilenetv2_0.75\r\n- mobilenetv2_0.5\r\n- mobilenetv2_0.25\r\n- resnet18_v1\r\n- resnet18_v2\r\n-

Description ##\r\nThis PR contains a few enhancements for MXNet extensions:\r\n- Refactors `MXLoadLib` to return the handle to the loaded library and expects the user (or language binding) to close the library later.\r\n- Refactors **lib_api.h** by moving the function definitions into **lib_api.cc** to simplify building extensions\r\n- Refactored relu_lib example to split into multiple files, separating CUDA code from CXX code. \r\n- Updates all the examples in **example/extensions** to use the new **lib_api.cc** build flow & removes Symbol tests (now that Symbol API is deprecated) and replaces them with Gluon tests\r\n\r\n### Other changes ###\r\nImproves the instructions in **config/linux_gpu.cmake** for building for specific GPU architectures. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds INT8 with calibration support to MXNet-TensorRT.\r\nIt enables TensorRT internal optimization to create an INT8 engine (that will contain some INT8 kernels, if they are faster than the FP16 or FP32 ones). \r\nIn this first version, the quantization and de-quantization values are computed during the calibration phase. During this phase (of a number of iterations set by the `calibration_iters`), the user is expect to provide samples representing the inference data, used to calibrate the engine. The inference model is slower during this phase.\r\nOnce the calibration is done, the MXNet-TensorRT inference model is ready for fast inference with INT8. \r\n\r\nSaving and loading of the calibration tables will be added in a later PR.\r\n\r\n## Usage ##\r\n\r\nWe set calibration_iters to the number of batches we can feed with the calibration dataset.\r\nFor instance:\r\n```\r\ncalibration_iters = 500\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe call optimize_for:\r\n_Symbolic_\r\n```\r\ntrt_sym = sym.optimize_for('TensorRT', args=arg_params, aux=aux_params, ctx=mx.gpu(0),\r\n                           int8_mode=True,\r\n                           calibration_iters=calibration_iters)\r\n```\r\n_Gluon_\r\n```\r\nmodel.optimize_for(input_data, backend='TensorRT', static_alloc=True, static_shape=True,\r\n                   backend_opts={'int8_mode':True, 'calibration_iters':calibration_iters})\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe create the executor and we feed the calibration data:\r\n```\r\n# (len(calibration_dataset) / batch_size)  == calibration_iters\r\nfor d in calibration_dataset:\r\n    executor.forward(is_train=False, data=data)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe calibration is slower than regular inference. Once it's done, we get a info message on stdout.\r\nThe executor with TRT INT8 engines is

PR fixes npx.random.bernoulli against large tensor. Testcases for npx.random.bernoulli, np.random.lognormal, np.random.randint, and np.random.shuffle are also added.\r\n\r\nNow all np.random and np.random ops should be fixed.\r\n\r\nNotice that large tensors tests are not added for the following ops:\r\nop (reason)\r\nnp.random.rand  (special case of np.rand.uniform)\r\nnp.random.multivariate-normal (falls back on python custom op which is going to be deprecated)\r\nnp.random.randn (special case of np.rand.normal)\r\nnp.random.f np.random.beta np.random.chisquare (internally calls np.random.gamma which is covered)\r\nnpx.random.normal_n (internally calls np.random.normal)\r\nnpx.random.uniform_n (internally calls np.random.uniform_n)\r\n\r\n\r\nTests added all passed locally.

issue: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/18942, an error was occurring where strides became zero. to solve the issue, the lower bounds of stride1 and stride2 have been set to 1.\r\n\r\nin issue: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/18994, a typo was mentioned. that has also been cleared.\r\n\r\nfix #18942 \r\nfix #18994 \r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\nWhen the correlation function is called on two arrays when the stride is zero, it results in a floating point exception as a division by zero is carried out. Thus, the lower bounds of stride1 and stride2 have been set to 1.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

Description ##\r\nAdd NVCC bug for windows build from source doc\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-21T03:52:36Z","updated_at":"2020-08-24T03:53:53Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"443a5abbf8cac2915d11859d8b32162e3f9d3953","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18978/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18978/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/18978/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/27689c3299952cb349c252315fea0cf671fff168","head":{"label":"stu1130:add_doc","ref":"add_doc","sha":"27689c3299952cb349c252315fea0cf671fff168","user":{"login":"stu1130","id":6792331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTIzMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6792331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130","html_url":"https://github.com/stu1130","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":143350706,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDMzNTA3MDY=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"stu1130/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stu1130","id":6792331,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTIzMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6792331?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130","html_url":"https://github.com/stu1130","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stu1130/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stu1130/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThe PR mitigates the build failure due to NVCC bug for building windows artifact.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n@leezu

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

Description ##\r\nBackport #18857 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If
