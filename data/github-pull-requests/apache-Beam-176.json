What really matters is how does functions work on this type, which shall be left for function implementations.\r\n\r\nThis is an **experimental** idea.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

pr adds basic IOIT that can be run for 1000 records (there's only hashcode for 1000 records currently). To make the code review easier and because I'm not a Kafka expert, I took a baby steps approach here - after this PR is approved consequent PRs will provide:\r\n\r\n - metrics collection\r\n - hashes for bigger loads \r\n - jenkins job to run automatically and on-demand & dashboards for them\r\n\r\nI ran this test on existing kubernetes kafka cluster that is there in .test-infra folder (with success). \r\n\r\n@aromanenko-dev @iemejia could you take a look?\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

adds support for passing docker run options through to the SDK harness container. The goal was to support mounting volumes, but is generalized to capture other `docker run [OPTIONS]` the user may desire. (`--user`?)\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the related [jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-5440), I chose the route of modifying the `DockerPayload` proto, and did not add additional `PortableOptions` flags. Instead these options are being parsed from the existing `PortableOptions.environment_config` within the SDK. I found how the `PortableOptions.environment_type` and `PortableOptions.environment_config` work fairly unintuitive and adding this additional esoteric behavior was acceptable for now.\r\n\r\n```\r\n--environment_config \"-v /tmp/beam_test:/tmp/beam_test {container_name}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith these changes, I've successfully executed a simple beam graph with a flink runner (via the python sdk) that mounts a volume and and touches a file. These changes should not break existing pipelines that simply omit any of the docker options.\r\n\r\nAssuming this is the desired approach, remaining issues would be:\r\n\r\n- Port changes to other SDKS\r\n- Add concept of `DockerPayload.options` to other parts of the core code. e.g. [Environments.createDockerEnvironment](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/runners/core-construction-java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/core/construction/Environments.java#L117).\r\n- Better tests? I've added a simple test in `portability_runner_test.py` confirming the parsing/construction of the DockerPayload proto.\r\n- I also updated `DockerSdkWorkerHandler`, but as far as I can tell this isn't being used anywhere?\r\n\r\nAny additional guidance would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

adds a `GetPipeline` method to the gRPC `JobService` and implements it for `InMemoryJobService`.   The method is quite similar to the existing `GetState` method in design/behavior. \r\n\r\nAs described in the Jira issue, I see this feature as a useful first step towards making the Job API capable of serving as a backend to a web app for submitting, viewing, and monitoring Beam jobs.  The next step after this PR would be to add a `GetJobs` method that sends a summary of all of the active jobs and their ids.  \r\n\r\nRemaining issues:\r\n\r\n- go: I have not implemented anything for the go sdk yet.  I'm still trying to figure out which version of `protoc` I need to use with `go generate`:  3.6 and 3.7 produced significant diffs, with a lot of style changes, so I assume it's something older.  Any help here would be greatly appreciated.\r\n- tests:  I've looked at the related tests for Java and Python and they don't seem to be testing the rpc service endpoints. The python tests in `portable_runner_test` seem to be largely starting the service and shutting it down in different ways, without actually running any test methods.  Basically what I'm saying is I don't see a clear framework for testing RPC methods in any language, but feel free to point me in the right direction. \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

takes the commits from #7061, rebases on master, and adds an `enableClustering` method to allow users to opt in to the updated coder when using dynamic destinations.\r\n\r\nThis follows the pattern of #6914 where we added a new version of `MetadataCoder`, documenting how a user could opt in and why they might want to.\r\n\r\nThis should solve the coder compatibility concerns that were the blockers to merging #7061. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

missed adding the streaming=True option to the PipelineOptions earlier. \r\nSince TestStream ends once watermark advances to infinity,\r\nthis test passed. \r\nBut, after adding the streaming flag, it failed,\r\nbecause the BigqueryFullResultMatcher did not poll for changes in a streaming test pipeline.\r\n\r\nAdded BigqueryFullResultStreamingMatcher to poll BigQuery before
