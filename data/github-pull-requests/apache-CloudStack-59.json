This should not be the case since we are able to add NS as the external LB provider in VPC.\n# Steps:\n1. Create a VPC offering with NS as the external LB provider\n2. Create a VPC and configure the public tier with the above offering\n3. Acquire an IP address and try to configure Load Balancing rule\n# Result:\n\nAutoscale option is not visible at all for the LB.\n# Expected Result:\n\nAutoscale option should be available and should work exactly like the way it works for a normal isolated network with NS. If we choose NS as service provider for LB, autoscale should also be visible.

time diff measurement by the class Profiler, is done by System.nanoTime().\nSystem.nanoTime() is not 100% accurate (lots of info on this on the web). The inaccurance seems to vary/depend with different dependencies (multi-core/OS/kernels).\n\nProblem:\nIn my case the code which measures `Thread.sleep(ONE_SECOND);` ~~takes~~ measures 999 milliseconds, which breaks the test expecting the sleep of 1000 milliseconds to ~~take~~ measure at least 1000 milliseconds.\n\nSolution:\nA `MARGIN` (of 100 milliseconds) is already present to factor in some time for overhead/surrounding code which adds time. Another margin could be added to factor in the possible time measurement error.\nTo limit additional lines of code, the constant `ONE_SECOND`, which is used by the testcase (sleep), is increased from 1000 milliseconds to `1000l + (MARGIN / 10)` (effectively 1010 milliseconds).\n\nThereby the inaccurancy on my system of ~1% (\"faster\") is caught as the `sleep(1010)` is measured as '1009' milliseconds.\n","created_at":"2016-01-08T13:13:53Z","updated_at":"2016-01-13T13:55:59Z","closed_at":"2016-01-11T15:21:49Z","merged_at":"2016-01-11T15:21:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"471883d03c4ad51c2d67fc69a3976ad6187e6437","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1324/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1324/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1324/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/dbb10a4ed5dc763b4c603e5cc3f2b70a202c0a2b","head":{"label":"bheuvel:testprofiler-second","ref":"testprofiler-second","sha":"dbb10a4ed5dc763b4c603e5cc3f2b70a202c0a2b","user":{"login":"bheuvel","id":2699104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTkxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2699104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bheuvel","html_url":"https://github.com/bheuvel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bheuvel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bheuvel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bheuvel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bheuvel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bheuvel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bheuvel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bheuvel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bheuvel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bheuvel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1bb8b8a66e5b9edba5b2039d14387595ccec1d6d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache

Cause: In the case of VM_POWER_STATE handler, if PowerOff or PowerReportMissing state is encountered, handlePowerOffReportWithNoPendingJobsOnVM() is called. If the VM is already in stopped state, so in DB the host ID is set to NULL. But in the above function, the sendStop() is still called on the empty hostID which results in the assertion error.\n\nFix: Added a condition in the sendStop() itself to check for the host id.

Issue:\n\nRoot admin cannot see LB rules and Public LB IP addresses created by domain-admin in UI therefore root admin cannot manage those.\n# Reproducible Steps:\n\nLog in as a Domain-Admin account and create a VPC with vpc virtual router as public load balancer provider\nclick on the newly created VPC -> click on the VPC tier -> click internal LB\nAdd internal LB,\nLogoff domain-admin and login as root admin\nNavigate the VPC created previously and click internal LB, internal lb is not showing up.\nSame steps for Public LB IP addresses except select the correct Network offering while creating a tier.\n# Expected Behaviour:\n\nRoot admin should be able to manage VPC created by Domain admin user .\n# Actual Behaviour:\n\nRoot admin cannot see VPC created by Domain admin user and hence not able to manage it.\n# Fix:\n\nAdded the parameter listAll=true in case of Internal LB as well as Public LB IP

LDAP plugin authenticates Cloudstack users against users in an LDAP group, and when doing so creates a Cloudstack account with the same name as the LDAP user, and a Cloudstack user also with the same name as the LDAP user.\nThis makes it difficult to manage the users in a given LDAP group because each user will have it's own account and user in Cloudstack, and cannot therefore collaborate in managing cloud resources.\n\nThis PR changes the LDAP plugin to use the LDAP group for the Cloudstack account name, and create the users (belonging to the LDAP group) under the same Cloudstack

PR applies the same fixes as in the PR #1259, but against branch 4.7.\n\nPlease refer to PR #1259 for the tests results and all the comments already made there.\n\nIssues fixed are:\n- CLOUDSTACK-9154: rVPC doesn't recover from cleaning up of network garbage collector\n- CLOUDSTACK-9187: rVPC routers in Master/Master due to concurrency problem when writing the keepalivd.conf\n- CLOUDSTACK-9188: NetworkGarbageCollector is not using gc.interval and gc.wait from settings\n\nThose changes have been covered by 2 new tests added to `smoke/test_vpc_redundant.py`:\n- test_04_rvpc_network_garbage_collector_nics\n- test_05_rvpc_multi_tiers\n\nThe test `test_04_rvpc_network_garbage_collector_nics` depends on the global settings for the network.gc.interval and gc.wait. If one wants the test to run quicker, please change the settings (default is 600 seconds for each) and restart the Management Server before running the tests.

Steps to Reproduce:\n\nCreate a volume using createVolume API where parameter name is empty.\nIt creates a volume with empty name.\nBut the name parameter is mandatory.(Issue)\n# Expected Behaviour:\n\nIt shouldn't create a volume with an empty name.

“_” from variables names**: private variables with “_” at the beginning is common in C++ but not in Java.\n\n**Removed unused code from ApiServer:**\n- com.cloud.api.ApiServer.getPluggableServices(): unused method;\n- com.cloud.api.ApiServer.getApiAccessCheckers(): unused method;\n\n**Methods and variables access level reviewed:**\n- com.cloud.api.ApiServer.handleAsyncJobPublishEvent(String, String ,Object): this method was private but the annotation @MessageHandler requests public methods, as can be seen in org.apache.cloudstack.framework.messagebus.MessageDispatcher.buildHandlerMethodCache(Class<?>), which searches methods with the @MessageHandler annotation and changes\n  it to be accessible (“setAccessible(true)”). Thus, there is no reason for handleAsyncJobPublishEvent be a private method and lead some other dev to wrong conclusions about the use of the method; \n- Global variables and methods called just by this class (ApiServer) were changed to private.\n\n**Changed variables and methods from static to non-static (if possible):** as some variables/methods are used just by one object of this class, instantiated by Spring, they were changed to non-static.\n\nWith that, calls from com.cloud.api.ApiServlet.ApiServlet() that used static methods from ApiServer, were changed from ApiServer.<staticMethodName> to _apiServer.<methodName> that refers to the org.apache.cloudstack.api.ApiServerService interface. Thus, methods com.cloud.api.ApiServer.getJSONContentType() and com.cloud.api.ApiServer.isSecureSessionCookieEnabled() had to be added in the interface (org.apache.cloudstack.api.ApiServerService, interface implemented by class

That has led us to a bunch of unused parameters in the getGuestOsType method from its superclass, which we've also decided to remove.

keepalivd.conf\n- CLOUDSTACK-9188: NetworkGarbageCollector is not using gc.interval and gc.wait from settings\n\nThose changes have been covered by 2 new tests added to `smoke/test_vpc_redundant.py`:\n- test_04_rvpc_network_garbage_collector_nics\n- test_05_rvpc_multi_tiers\n\nThe test `test_04_rvpc_network_garbage_collector_nics` depends on the global settings for the network.gc.interval and gc.wait. If one wants the test to run quicker, please change the settings (default is 600 seconds for each) and restart the Management Server before running the tests. I would suggest to set it to 60 seconds.\n\nIn addition, the NetworkGarbageCollector was redefining the settings above mentioned and not reading their values through ConfigDao. Due to that, the settings were not being applied properly and the test was waiting to long to check the VPC routers.\n","created_at":"2015-12-19T15:39:32Z","updated_at":"2015-12-22T16:14:58Z","closed_at":"2015-12-22T16:14:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8405bc3480d165cddca1f24244992550870c550e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1259/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1259/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1259/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/8848c4f11342e8ebb0b231b5df07c91649b560ef","head":{"label":"artificially-ai:fix/rvpc-net-gc-CLOUDSTACK-9154","ref":"fix/rvpc-net-gc-CLOUDSTACK-9154","sha":"8848c4f11342e8ebb0b231b5df07c91649b560ef","user":{"login":"artificially-ai","id":4188903,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQxODg5MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4188903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai","html_url":"https://github.com/artificially-ai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"94a14485f76e6c6a5416f7840a6e857bdc38cfce","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache

Issue:\n\nRoot admin cannot see LB rules and Public LB IP addresses created by domain-admin in UI therefore root admin cannot manage those.\n# Reproducible Steps: \n1.  Log in as a Domain-Admin account and create a VPC with vpc virtual router as public load balancer provider \n2.  click on the newly created VPC -> click on the VPC tier -> click internal LB \n3.  Add internal LB, \n4.  Logoff domain-admin and login as root admin \n5.  Navigate the VPC created previously and click internal LB, internal lb is not showing up.\n\nSame steps for Public LB IP addresses except select the correct Network offering while creating a tier.\n# Expected Behaviour: \n\nRoot admin should be able to manage VPC created by Domain admin user .\n# Actual Behaviour:\n\nRoot admin cannot see VPC created by Domain admin user and hence not able to manage it.\n# Fix:\n\nAdded the parameter listAll=true in case of Internal LB as well as Public LB IP

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nCLOUDSTACK-9175: [VMware DRS] Adding new host to DRS cluster does not participate in load balancing.\r\n\r\nSummary: When a new host is added to a cluster, Cloudstack doesn't create all the port groups (created by cloudstack earlier in other hosts) present in the cluster. Since the new host doesn't have all the necessary networking port groups of cloudstack, it is not eligible to participate in DRS load balancing or HA.\r\n\r\nSolution: When adding a host to the cluster in Cloudstack, use VMware API to find the list of unique port groups on a previously added host (older host in the cluster) if exists and then create them on the new host.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n Fixes: #3156 \r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

the default value of this setting, which is currently 256, by decreasing it to 8 because even a dvportgroup with autoexpand feature enabled there exists an initial number of ports as starting point, which can be again configured through this configuration setting. But keeping this value 256 doesn't make sense when auto expand feature is available. Keeping the starting number of dvports per dvportgroup to reasonably minimum would ensure optimal distribution across dvportgroups in dvSwitch.\n\nThe vSphere Auto Expand feature (introduced in vSphere 5.0) will take care of dynamically increasing/decreasing the dvPorts when running out of distributed ports . But in case of vSphere 4.1/4.0 (If used), as this feature is not there, the new default value (=> 8) have an impact in the existing deployments. Action item for vSphere 4.1/4.0: Admin should modify the global configuration setting \"vmware.ports.per.dvportgroup\" from 8 to any number based on their environment because the proposal default value of 8 would be very less without auto expand feature in general. The current default value of 256 may not need immediate modification after deployment, but 8 would be very less which means admin need to update immediately after upgrade.\n","created_at":"2015-12-17T04:39:56Z","updated_at":"2018-05-10T09:29:35Z","closed_at":"2018-05-10T08:17:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8b1080f2fa793270b3a740885efdbe3b8a6bec9a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1253/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1253/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1253/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/deb2f530b71c1dc13665c0b8dacfb025c38f58b9","head":{"label":"sureshanaparti:CLOUDSTACK-9184","ref":"CLOUDSTACK-9184","sha":"deb2f530b71c1dc13665c0b8dacfb025c38f58b9","user":{"login":"sureshanaparti","id":12028987,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI4OTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12028987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshanaparti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40086470,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDA4NjQ3MA==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"sureshanaparti/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sureshanaparti","id":12028987,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI4OTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12028987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshanaparti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sureshanaparti/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

When a new host is added to a cluster, Cloudstack doesn't create all the port groups (created by cloudstack earlier in other hosts) present in the cluster. Since the new host doesn't have all the necessary networking port groups of cloudstack, it is not eligible to participate in DRS load balancing or HA.\n\nSolution: When adding a host to the cluster in Cloudstack, use VMware API to find the list of unique port groups on a previously added host (older host in the cluster) if exists and then create them on the new

- Fixed\n\nRCA:\nWhen we do not provide account parameter which is an optional field , API picks up the account from which we are logged in. So this works fine with cloudmonkey and ACS UI. But if we fire API directly from the browser(Make sure no cookies are stored and you are not logged in), by default system account is picked and the VPN users addition fails. This behaviour is expected, but no exception is thrown. So users think that VPN user is created.\n\nFix: Added an exception when VPN users are added in the system account.
