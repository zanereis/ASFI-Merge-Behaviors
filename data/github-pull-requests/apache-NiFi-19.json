Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12243](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12243) Refactors the `encrypt-config` command implementation using the [picocli](https://picocli.info) framework.\r\n\r\nThe refactored implementation replaces Groovy-based components and maintains the existing set of command line arguments with the following adjustments:\r\n\r\n- Changed `-A` to `-u` for output authorizers.xml when targeting Registry, aligning with the standard command\r\n- Removed `--newFlowProvider` option not used\r\n- Removed `--translateCli` option\r\n- Removed `--decrypt` option for Registry\r\n\r\nUpdates to the Toolkit Guide reflect these changes.\r\n\r\nThe existing implementation prompted for an interactive password under certain conditions, but the refactored implementation requires providing the command argument without a value in order to prompt the user.\r\n\r\nNew unit tests exercise several common operations and check expected output files. The refactored approach avoids duplicating large configuration file examples in favor of small examples that exercise various conditions.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12219](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12219) Backports Flow Configuration History persistent storage using JetBrains Xodus as implemented for [NIFI-12206](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12206) and adds migration capabilities to the support branch for subsequent NiFi version 1 releases.\r\n\r\nThe `EntityStoreAuditService` class contains the same implementation as merged for NIFI-12219, and the new `FlowConfigurationHistoryMigrator` supports automated migration from H2 to Xodus on startup. The migrator checks for the presence of the H2 database file named `nifi-flow-audit.mv.db` and proceeds with migration when found. The migration process includes checking for older H2 binary formats, supporting all previous versions of H2 from 1.4 through 2.2. The migration process then uses available paging capabilities from the H2-based `AuditService` to transfer records. Following successful migration, the `FlowConfigurationHistoryMigrator` renames `nifi-flow-audit.mv.db` with a backup timestamp extension.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following

The JSON format would be the preferred choice, but it requires an additional frontend dependency to render. Personally, I don't believe that having just a single animation from that source justifies adding the extra dependency. I'm including it in the PR primarily as an option for potential future use.\r\n\r\nTo see it in action, I recommend setting a breakpoint at: https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/ae61ebb5eda7076c6a18ba0419b614b8516faf14/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-framework-bundle/nifi-framework/nifi-web/nifi-web-api/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/web/api/FlowResource.java#L1229\r\n\r\nScreenshot

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12206](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12206) Refactors the Flow Configuration History auditing to use the JetBrains [Xodus](https://github.com/JetBrains/xodus) library for persistent storage in place of the [H2 Database Engine](https://h2database.com/html/main.html).\r\n\r\nThese changes are targeted for the main branch, and follow-on work will handle automated migration for the support branch.\r\n\r\nThe implementation removes the existing `StandardAuditService` and adds an `EntityStoreAuditService` with transactional operations using an Xodus [Entity Store](https://github.com/JetBrains/xodus/wiki/Entity-Stores). Changes include removing the `nifi.h2.url.append` property from `nifi.properties`.\r\n\r\nThe new `EntityStoreAuditService` includes exception handling when loading to avoid application startup failures for corrupted files. The exception handling approach renames files in the database directory with a backup timestamp extension, and then proceeds to create a new instance. This strategy allows the potential for manual recovery, while enabling the application to start with a new persistent entity store.\r\n\r\nThe new implementation supports existing Flow Configuration History queries with results filtering and paging. Queries against a test environment containing over one million entries remained responsive for both filtered and unfiltered results.\r\n\r\nJetBrains Xodus is licensed under Apache Software License Version 2.0 and does not contain additional notices.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X]

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12188](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12188) Upgrades Apache Commons Net from 3.9.0 to [3.10.0](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-net/changes-report.html#a3.10.0), which incorporates several bug fixes and improvements.\r\n\r\nImprovements in Commons Net 3.10.0 include resolving [NET-650](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NET-650), which delegates host resolution to `java.net.Socket.connect()` methods, improving support for access through HTTP or SOCKS5 proxy servers. This improvement obviates the need for the Apache NiFi `ProxyFTPClient`, which is removed along with the associated unit test class.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12185](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12185) Adds a `nifi-bom` Bill of Materials module at the root level containing a Maven configuration with shared dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe `nifi-bom` defines a limited set of dependencies with specific scopes designed for extension components. The purpose of `nifi-bom` is to support both internal and external extensions with consistent versioning for shared interfaces.\r\n\r\nThis pull request applies the `nifi-bom` to the `nifi-commons` and `nifi-nar-bundles` parent projects. This approach uncovered a number of implicit transitive dependencies on `nifi-property-utils`, containing the `StringUtils` class, and `nifi-utils`, which provides common validators and other utilities. The `nifi-property-utils` module is available to all components based on its presence in the `lib` directory, and `nifi-standard-services-api-nar` already bundles `nifi-utils`. Inheriting the defined scope and version from `nifi-bom` provided the opportunity to surface these dependencies explicitly in a number of extension Maven configurations.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of `nifi-bom` also provided the opportunity to remove explicit version numbers and scopes from most referencing modules. This reduces the number of changes required when releasing new project versions.\r\n\r\nThe initial scope of `nifi-bom` is limited to public and framework API modules, as well as a subset of modules under the `nifi-commons` directory. For `nifi-commons` in particular, there is a smaller subset of modules with wider usage and greater stability, providing sufficient reason to include them in `nifi-bom`.\r\n\r\nThe nature of this new `nifi-bom` module limits the scope to the main branch, targeted for NiFi 2.0.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12163](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12163) Improves Syslog handling in the `ParseSyslog5424` and `Syslog5424Reader` components with the elimination of unnecessary String to byte conversion.\r\n\r\nPrimary changes include streamlining the event parsing method to take a String instead of `ByteBuffer` created from a String. The supporting SyslogParser method accepts a String, so this approach avoids the intermediate conversion steps. Additional changes include providing the configured character set to the appropriate `InputStreamReader`, instead of having it default to platform encoding. \r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12115](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12115) Adds a `ListenOTLP` Processor to collect OpenTelemetry information, supporting [OTLP Specification 1.0.0](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/).\r\n\r\nOTLP defines HTTP as the basic communication protocol and outlines the following transport encoding options:\r\n\r\n- Protobuf over gRPC\r\n- Protobuf over HTTP\r\n- JSON over HTTP\r\n\r\nOTLP also includes support for [gzip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip) compression over gRPC or HTTP.\r\n\r\nThe `ListenOTLP` Processor supports the standard transport encoding options and uses content negotiation based on the HTTP `Content-Type` header to select the appropriate parsing implementation.\r\n\r\nThe Processor converts incoming requests to standard OpenTelemetry objects and writes objects using the standard JSON encoding, which includes special handling for hexadecimal-encoding identifiers. Using JSON as the standard output format allows subsequent Processors to select or filter as necessary. Output FlowFiles can contain a batch of one or more resource elements, depending on data volumes and batch size configuration. `ListenOTLP` adds the `client.socket.address` and `client.socket.port` attributes to the `Resource` definition of received requests to provide an additional level of source tracking.\r\n\r\nThe Processor requires an `SSL Context Service` property to enforce communication over HTTPS. The gRPC protocol requires HTTP/2, which uses Application Protocol Negotiation in the TLS handshake to select the HTTP version. With the potentially sensitive nature of telemetry information, the initial version of `ListenOTLP` requires HTTPS, and can be configured for mTLS with `Client Authentication` required.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include updates to the `nifi-event-transport` library supporting configurable TLS Cipher Suites through optional `SSLParameters` settings. HTTP/2 requires a restricted set of TLS Cipher Suites, so this adjustment supports that approach.\r\n\r\nThe [opentelemetry-proto](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto) and [jackson-datatype-protobuf](https://github.com/HubSpot/jackson-datatype-protobuf) libraries are both licensed under Apache Software License Version 2 with no additional notice files.\r\n\r\nOTLP 1.0.0 JSON examples are available in the [opentelemetry-proto](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/tree/v1.0.0/examples/) examples directory.\r\n\r\nFor testing with an instrumented system, the [OpenTelemetry Java Agent](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/java/automatic/agent-config/) can be configured using Java System properties in `bootstrap.conf` for basic instrumentation of JVM memory and Jetty calls using the following properties:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.arg.otelAgent=-javaagent:./opentelemetry-javaagent.jar\r\njava.arg.otelCertificate=-Dotel.exporter.otlp.certificate=./conf/trusted.pem\r\njava.arg.otelEndpoint=-Dotel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=https://localhost:4317\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `trusted.pem` file must contain the issuer of the server certificate configured for `ListenOTLP`. The OpenTelemetry Java Agent defaults to using gRPC for transport encoding without compression, but additional options can be configured based on the [OTLP exporter properties](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/main/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure/README.md#otlp-exporter-span-metric-and-log-exporters).\r\n\r\nThis pull request targets the main branch, with the intent of backporting the addition following minor adjustments.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n###

on `main`, when a user chooses to create a new service as a property value, dependent properties do not show until the user applies their changes and re-opens the processor configuration menu (see gif below, record reader and record writer on the ListenHTTP processor are a good example to test). This is because we are running the logic to show/hide dependent properties on selecting the `Create a new service.` We should should be running this logic after a user creates the new service.\r\n\r\n![12088-before-fix](https://github.com/apache/nifi/assets/7304869/db34637d-5fb5-4fb7-93c2-316022caad48)\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nClone this PR branch locally and rebuild NiFi. Follow the steps in the gif above. You should see the record writer property without having to apply your changes and reopen the processor configuration menu. \r\n\r\n<!-- Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more -->\r\n<!-- contributor license agreements.
