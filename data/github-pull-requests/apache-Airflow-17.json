Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn the FTPSHook it's also possible to pass a buffer (like StringIO/BytesIO) instead of a path, I've refactored the retrieve_file and store_file methods in SFTPHook so those also support those types.  This avoids the need to create a file to be able to download a file to FTP, you can directly download it into a buffer and vice versa if you need to upload content to an FTP server you don't need to create a file locally to be able to upload it.  I just delegate this to the underlying paramiko getfo and putfo methods, nothing fancy had to be done to achieve this as the paramiko library already supported this.  This shortcoming was described as a pitfall for the SFTPHook.\r\n\r\nAlso using our in-house StreamOperator which allows executing an operator in a multi-threaded way within the same worker (similar to expand but then distributing the work over multiple threads within the same worker instead of multiple workers), we discovered that when using the SFTPHook in a PythonOperator to retrieve a file, the connections don't get closed, which seems probable as each thread has to instantiate a new SFTPHook as the underlying library paramiko isn't thread-safe.  When you look at the source code you'll notice that each operation within the SFTPHook get's a connection but actually never closes it as you have to call the close_conn method manually.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def retrieve_file(self, remote_full_path: str, local_full_path: str, prefetch: bool = True) -> None:\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Transfer the remote file to a local location.\r\n\r\n        If local_full_path is a string path, the file will be put\r\n        at that location.\r\n\r\n        :param remote_full_path: full path to the remote file\r\n        :param local_full_path: full path to the local file or a file-like buffer\r\n        :param prefetch: controls whether prefetch is performed (default: True)\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        conn = self.get_conn()\r\n        if isinstance(local_full_path, BytesIO):\r\n            conn.getfo(remote_full_path, local_full_path, prefetch=prefetch)\r\n        else:\r\n            conn.get(remote_full_path, local_full_path, prefetch=prefetch)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the past we didn't use the SFTPHook but used directly the paramiko library like this and didn't have any issues:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def get_file(remote_full_path: str) -> str:\r\n        buffer = BytesIO()\r\n        conn = get_connection(conn_id=sftp_conn)\r\n        with Transport((conn.host, conn.port)) as transport:\r\n            transport.connect(username=conn.login, password=conn.password)\r\n            with SFTPClient.from_transport(transport) as sftp:\r\n                sftp.retrieve_file(remote_full_path, buffer)  # Download file to buffer\r\n        return buffer.getvalue().decode(\"utf-8\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I think we should refactor the SFTP hook so it always release the sftp connection after each operator to avoid connection leaks:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def retrieve_file(self, remote_full_path: str, local_full_path: str, prefetch: bool = True) -> None:\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Transfer the remote file to a local location.\r\n\r\n        If local_full_path is a string path, the file will be put\r\n        at that location.\r\n\r\n        :param remote_full_path: full path to the remote file\r\n        :param local_full_path: full path to the local file or a file-like buffer\r\n        :param prefetch: controls whether prefetch is performed (default: True)\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        with self.get_sftp_conn() as conn:\r\n            if isinstance(local_full_path, BytesIO):\r\n                conn.getfo(remote_full_path, local_full_path, prefetch=prefetch)\r\n            else:\r\n                conn.get(remote_full_path, local_full_path, prefetch=prefetch)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOtherwise we would need to call it like this, in the above you don't need to worry about the connection:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def retrieve_file(self, remote_full_path: str, local_full_path: str, prefetch: bool = True) -> None:\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Transfer the remote file to a local location.\r\n\r\n        If local_full_path is a string path, the file will be put\r\n        at that location.\r\n\r\n        :param remote_full_path: full path to the remote file\r\n        :param local_full_path: full path to the local file or a file-like buffer\r\n        :param prefetch: controls whether prefetch is performed (default: True)\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        try:\r\n            conn = self.get_sftp_conn():\r\n            if isinstance(local_full_path, BytesIO):\r\n                conn.getfo(remote_full_path, local_full_path, prefetch=prefetch)\r\n            else:\r\n                conn.get(remote_full_path, local_full_path, prefetch=prefetch)```\r\n        finally:\r\n            conn.close()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've added a

Handling `TIDeferredStatePayload` in `ti_update_state` -> covered by unit test: `test_ti_update_state_to_deferred`\r\n      a. Didn't piggy back on `ti.defer_task()` as it extracts the trigger out of `TaskDeferred` exception. It is much more expensive to send across multiple models like `TaskInstance`, `TaskDeferred`, `Trigger` instead of just the required minimal properties\r\n      b. `returning` and not proceeding with query execution as we already do it above https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/44241/files#diff-d44a72566870079ee943e24bac2af74fb84c426c54d210561a251549a7078ed7L129\r\n2. Defining a datamodel for TIDeferredStatePayload and adding it to the discriminator: ti_state_discriminator\r\n\r\n### Client side changes (task sdk):\r\n\r\n#### HTTP client:\r\nAdded a new function defer that sends a patch request to the `task-instances/{id}/state execution` api with payload: `PatchTIToDeferred`\r\n\r\n#### Comms:\r\nDefining a new data model to send a request to patch ti as \"deferred\" from task runner to supervisor: `PatchTIToDeferred`  (Added to ToSupervisor)\r\n\r\n#### Supervisor:\r\n1. Adding a new class property as `_final_state` to support `@property` `final_state` which is final state of a TI\r\n      a. Added a setter to set values for this final state for cases like deferred so that the finish is not called for tasks those aren't in terminal stage: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/44241/files#diff-c2651fdee1a25e091e2a9d4f937f8032ca3d289d0de76f38ed88aee5df0f880dL392-L394\r\n2. Deferred tasks first enter the \"wait\" in supervisor and then mark themselves as deferred by setting up a trigger. So skipping `finish()` when `final_state` is not `TerminalTIState` \r\n3. Extended `handle_requests` to receive requests from task runner and forwarding the message to http client to call defer\r\n\r\n#### TaskRunner:\r\nTask runner executes: ti.task.execute and raises `TaskDeferred` for deferral. This sends a request to supervisor using `SUPERVISOR_COMMS`\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this tested?\r\n1. The end to end flow isn't available as of now, but I have tried to cover up the ground using unit tests\r\n2. New case under `test_handle_requests` covers the supervisor + client side of things along with a mock of the message from task runner\r\n3. `test_ti_update_state_to_deferred` covers the scenario for execution API\r\n4. Added an integration test for task runner component:\r\n- It creates a DAG that raises the deferral exception:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/871fdfd1-034d-4b66-a25a-0981a47f860c)\r\n- `test_run_deferred_basic` tests if the DAG raised a task exception and sent the right message across the SUPERVISOR_COMMS or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Additional sanity tests\r\n### Testing the \"task runner\" entries and exits (client side)\r\n\r\n1. Wrote a async operator DAG:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/425ec4e8-3695-4695-894b-d21c84d47ff1)\r\n\r\n2. Breakpoint inside task_runner.py#run\r\n\r\n3. Validated the exception entrypoint with all the variables to be set as required by running the test: `test_run_basic`\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afdaa611-7350-45b5-9d4b-282a7a71d5dc)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing the DB state in the server side (execution API)\r\n1. Used the test: `test_ti_update_state_to_deferred`\r\n\r\n2. Debugger inside `ti_update_state` method\r\n\r\n3. Validated the `TaskDeferred` and related logic\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fb7d632-4bc1-439c-a0b8-7143a751e01a)\r\n\r\n5. Checked state of the DB on execution\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fbde3e2-734b-43c2-8a02-464f401760b7)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5249dae5-cb81-45a2-a761-ff2437c6fed5)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--

Updated `VariableOperations` and `ConnectionOperations` in `Client`:\r\n  - Added `get` methods for fetching variable and connection details.\r\n- Refactored communication protocol (`comms.py`):\r\n  - Unified result models (`ConnectionResult`, `VariableResult`, `XComResult`) extending auto-generated models.\r\n  - Renamed `ReadXCom` to `GetXCom` for consistency with other request models (`GetConnection`, `GetVariable`).\r\n- Updated `WatchedSubprocess` in `supervisor.py`:\r\n  - Integrated `handle_requests` to process `GetVariable` and `GetConnection` messages.\r\n\r\nand some minor

The configuration returned is also saved as instance attribute for later use of OpenLineage method.\r\n\r\nIn the same time, I'm modifying two **internal** OpenLineage utils function:\r\n\r\n- `get_facets_from_bq_table` now do not return facets instead of returning empty facets when there is no schema or description for bq table\r\n- `get_identity_column_lineage_facet` is now checking if the source columns included in column lineage facet are actually in the schema of source datasets. It's now possible to generate this facet when source tables contain subset of columns of a destination table, which can be a case f.e. in BQ to BQ copy.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above

SQL does not permit the use of the AS keyword when aliasing subqueries. While AS is valid for column and table aliases in some contexts, subquery aliases must not include the keyword AS. This PR addresses this limitation in the SQLTableCheckOperator.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\nUpdated the SQLTableCheckOperator to handle Oracle-specific SQL syntax by omitting the AS keyword for subquery aliases.\r\nIntroduced a check to determine the database type, ensuring this adjustment is applied only for Oracle SQL.\r\nAdded relevant unit tests to ensure compatibility across supported databases.\r\nCloses:\r\nCloses [#44135](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/44135).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis change ensures that Airflow's SQLTableCheckOperator works seamlessly with Oracle SQL while maintaining compatibility with other databases.","created_at":"2024-11-20T09:35:06Z","updated_at":"2025-01-12T00:17:20Z","closed_at":"2025-01-12T00:17:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"81eb2b0b8d56fa9104842520e8bf6a0b483d14cf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eladkal","id":45845474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODQ1NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45845474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal","html_url":"https://github.com/eladkal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

I believe this was done as a workaround when it was implemented.  Switching it to a lookup function would let this object be managed by helm so that the chart controls the objects it creates and and can create the object during upgrade, which would be expected for a subchart if added.  \r\n\r\nThe downside of switching this is that for this upgrade we would have to manually delete the three secrets prior to the upgrade. \r\n\r\n1. fernet-key\r\n2.

scratched my head on this one.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nTests are green, CI is green, manual API testing looks good, but when we use the UI, we see random 500 errors from time to time, cf screenshot.\r\n\r\nAll that hint to a bug in the session management. Between the DB dependency from fastapi, the way fastapi uses multiple thread to serve `sync` route requests, how we create session in airflow utility code and when / how are sessions rolled back / commited.\r\n\r\n## TLDR:\r\nThe default `Session` factory uses sessionmaker that will make a session thread local, on the other hand FastAPI can re-use the same thread to serve multiple requests but because of the dependency we use, the session is closed after each request making successive requests on the same thread to fail.\r\n\r\nSession lifecycle that we want is not `per thread` but `per  HTTTP request`. To achieve that we delegate the `session` handling to FastAPI dependency system and use a normal session factory not a threadlocal one.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-11-19 at 16 06

[PR](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/41325) broke OL tests as `openlineage` tests heavily rely on assets and are often broken after asset changes. We want to trigger OL test whenever there is a change in Asset related files.\r\n\r\ncloses: [#44026](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/44026)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line

of #43520.\r\nNote: Cherry-pick is w/o K8s provider files as these are always taken from main during test and release.\r\n\r\nThe old \"stuck in queued\" logic just failed the tasks.  Now we requeue them.  We accomplish this by revoking the task from executor and setting state to scheduled.  We'll re-queue it up to 2 times.  Number of times is configurable by hidden config.\r\n\r\nWe added a method to base executor revoke_task because, it's a discrete operation that is required for this feature, and it might be useful in other cases e.g. when detecting as zombies etc.  We set state to failed or scheduled directly from scheduler (rather than sending through the event buffer) because event buffer makes more sense for handling external events -- why round trip through the executor and back to scheduler when scheduler is initiating the action?  Anyway this avoids having to deal with \"state mismatch\" issues when processing events.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit

PR implements directory transfer for SFTPOperator, related to the [issue](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/40365) I have raised before.\r\nCurrently, the SFTPOperator only accepts file paths, and you have to specify every filename in a folder by list when transferring an entire folder.\r\nBy adding some directory handling logic, the operator now can accept directory paths as well, allowing users easily transfer entire folders.\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-18T07:47:45Z","updated_at":"2024-12-31T05:01:15Z","closed_at":"2024-12-28T01:44:25Z","merged_at":"2024-12-28T01:44:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"51fea3e7fb3c4f35f6f3893139baf80e4e3634d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5799451325,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAgUK288AAAABWayavQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:sftp","name":"provider:sftp","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/44126/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/44126/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/44126/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/d78e51afe96e0b5d7fb78ea694a3f0ee65b533d0","head":{"label":"Dawnpool:main","ref":"main","sha":"d78e51afe96e0b5d7fb78ea694a3f0ee65b533d0","user":{"login":"Dawnpool","id":57010815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDEwODE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57010815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dawnpool","html_url":"https://github.com/Dawnpool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dawnpool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dawnpool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dawnpool/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dawnpool/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dawnpool/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dawnpool/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dawnpool/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dawnpool/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dawnpool/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":840245587,"node_id":"R_kgDOMhUhUw","name":"airflow","full_name":"Dawnpool/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Dawnpool","id":57010815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDEwODE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57010815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dawnpool","html_url":"https://github.com/Dawnpool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dawnpool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dawnpool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dawnpool/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dawnpool/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dawnpool/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dawnpool/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dawnpool/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dawnpool/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dawn

#43896\r\nrelated: #43657\r\n\r\n### Fix: Add `max_length=256` for `PoolPostBody.pool`  \r\n\r\nThe model defined in https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/models/pool.py#L54 enforces a string length constraint on `Pool.pool`. To maintain consistency, this constraint should also be validated at the router level.  \r\n\r\n### Refactor: Handle Duplicate Cases in `Insert Pool`  \r\n\r\nThe `Insert Pool` (single insert) functionality should account for cases where a duplicate pool name is provided, as `Pool.pool` is defined with a `unique` constraint.  \r\n\r\n### Feat: Add Insert Multiple Pools API  \r\n\r\nA new API endpoint for inserting multiple pools has been introduced as `/pools/bulk`. Alternative names such as `/pools/batch` or `/pools/multiple` were considered. Feedback on which name best describes the endpoint is welcome.  \r\n","created_at":"2024-11-18T02:53:50Z","updated_at":"2025-01-23T09:15:20Z","closed_at":"2024-11-22T08:40:35Z","merged_at":"2024-11-22T08:40:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"f33166a612218a10cee0e42cde36bc43fc184222","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jscheffl","id":95105677,"node_id":"U_kgDOBasyjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95105677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl","html_url":"https://github.com/jscheffl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1937475224,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTM3NDc1MjI0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:API","name":"area:API","color":"efe07c","default":false,"description":"Airflow's REST/HTTP API"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.
