you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFixes https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-12929:\r\nChanged scala.StreamExecutionEnvironment.addSource to pass the type info for a SourceFunction that does not extend ResultTypeQueryable.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nsee above\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNo test added as scala/StreamExecutionEnvironment.scala seems to be not covered yet\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-27T11:31:48Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T15:21:25Z","closed_at":"2019-07-10T11:19:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"386a3dfca805ca670774527484b9d4dc80cf89db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272993677,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzNjc3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/Scala","name":"component=API/Scala","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273183016,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgzMDE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/TypeSerializationSystem","name":"component=API/TypeSerializationSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8914/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8914/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8914/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e5821043e99f59a16d3c4275a55641446d0fa707","head":{"label":"lombarde:pass-type-information-add-source-scala","ref":"pass-type-information-add-source-scala","sha":"e5821043e99f59a16d3c4275a55641446d0fa707","user":{"login":"lombarde","id":14979221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTc5MjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14979221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lombarde","html_url":"https://github.com/lombarde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lombarde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lombarde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lombarde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lombarde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lombarde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lombarde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lombarde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lombarde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lombarde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":193920498,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTM5MjA0OTg=","name":"flink","full_name":"lombarde/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lombarde","id":14979221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTc5MjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14979221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lombarde","html_url":"https://github.com/lombarde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lombarde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lombarde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lombarde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lombarde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lombarde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lombarde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lombarde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lombarde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lombarde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lombarde/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrent implementation of `#needToCleanupState` in `KeyedProcessFunctionWithCleanupState` used incorrect way to judge whether the time should cleaned up. We should sue `equals` instead of `==` to compare wrapper type of Long. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Correct the logic of `#needToCleanupState` in `KeyedProcessFunctionWithCleanupState`.\r\n  - Correct the check logic of  whether there are still records which have not been processed yet in `AbstractRowTimeUnboundedPrecedingOver`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Updated test of `OverWindowHarnessTest`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUpdate IDE setup instructions for latest IntelliJ IDEA\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nUpdated files ide_setup.md and ide_setup.zh.md\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage. Furthermore, I followed the step by step instructions reflected in this change to successfully import and compile Flink on IJ.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-27T07:19:18Z","updated_at":"2019-07-22T09:38:50Z","closed_at":"2019-07-03T22:36:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"895d3b6b051b519b28ab6542a7ebf03995202f94","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8908/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8908/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8908/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/bc9859ca738970adf160a18cdfa21b8694685def","head":{"label":"hmcl:master_hotfix_doc_ij","ref":"master_hotfix_doc_ij","sha":"bc9859ca738970adf160a18cdfa21b8694685def","user":{"login":"hmcl","id":10284328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjg0MzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10284328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl","html_url":"https://github.com/hmcl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119444598,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTk0NDQ1OTg=","name":"flink","full_name":"hmcl/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hmcl","id":10284328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjg0MzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10284328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl","html_url":"https://github.com/hmcl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmcl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hmcl/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n- The goal is to fix the findbugs warning in AggregationsFunctio.scala\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-13008\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *throw the unsupportedOperationException rather than return it*\r\n \r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* This change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? \r\n","created_at":"2019-06-27T03:38:29Z","updated_at":"2019-10-24T18:01:25Z","closed_at":"2019-10-16T13:59:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"11906bb48645a1fe48cfc7cf7ac5f8973db8071a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1291537903,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjkxNTM3OTAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Runtime","name":"component=TableSQL/Runtime","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8906/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8906/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8906/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d9fdee4191a92ea21dd1eb5d400ed54a627750b3","head":{"label":"wangpeibin713:FLINK-13008-Fix_Bug_in_AggregationsFunction#remove","ref":"FLINK-13008-Fix_Bug_in_AggregationsFunction#remove","sha":"d9fdee4191a92ea21dd1eb5d400ed54a627750b3","user":{"login":"wangpeibin713","id":2971939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzE5Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2971939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangpeibin713","html_url":"https://github.com/wangpeibin713","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangpeibin713/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangpeibin713/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangpeibin713/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangpeibin713/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangpeibin713/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangpeibin713/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangpeibin713/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangpeibin713/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangpeibin713/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":132831981,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzI4MzE5ODE=","name":"flink","full_name":"wangpeibin713/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangpeibin713","id":2971939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzE5Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2971939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangpeibin713","html_url":"https://github.com/wangpeibin713","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangpeibin713/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangpeibin713/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangpeibin713/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangpeibin713/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangpeibin713/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangpeibin713/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangpeibin713/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangpeibin713/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangpeibin713/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangpeibin713/flink","description":"Mirror

This introduction assumes no previous experience with Flink or stream processing and works within an IDE. \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\necbafb6  Adds a new module `flink-walkthrough-common` that users will include as a dependency when following along with the tutorial. It includes custom sources, sinks and UDFs which allows us to take advantage of more advanced features without exposing details to new users.\r\n\r\n1182ddf Adds a table walkthrough archetype. Similar to the existing quickstart archetypes it allows users to quickly get a working project. It is different in that it includes extra dependencies and code specific to this walkthrough such as setting up the table environment and registering sources / sinks.\r\n\r\n92c65d3 Adds the actual walkthrough under the getting started section of the docs.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis is a feature port from flink-planner to blink-planner to support temporal TableFunction join (or called versioned joins).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Introduce some rules to convert a UDTF correlate to temporal table join.\r\n- Introduce `TemporalProcessTimeJoinOperator` and `TemporalRowTimeJoinOperator` for support temporal join in runtime.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added integration tests `TemporalUdtfJoinITCase`\r\n- Added plan test `TemporalUdtfJoinTest`\r\n\r\nThe above cases are based on SQL, some TableAPI cases are not ported.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-26T13:37:42Z","updated_at":"2019-06-28T13:41:59Z","closed_at":"2019-06-28T13:41:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cef506e7107e275317878d1b36161e286161bb8d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8901/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8901/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8901/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/cecb858af3c8a865fe70dd55284262ec747e9c49","head":{"label":"wuchong:temporal-udtf","ref":"temporal-udtf","sha":"cecb858af3c8a865fe70dd55284262ec747e9c49","user":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63797485,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Mzc5NzQ4NQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"wuchong/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently it is non-blocking in case of credit-based flow control (default), however for SpilledBufferOrEventSequence it is blocking on reading from file. We might want to consider reimplementing it to be non blocking with CompletableFuture<?> isAvailable() method.\r\n\r\nOtherwise we will block mailbox processing for the duration of reading from file - for example we will block processing time timers and potentially in the future network flushes.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nUse a ByteBuffer pool to read the BufferOrEvent asynchronous.\r\n- the pool size if default 2, can be configurated by key `taskmanager.memory.async-load.buffer-count`\r\n- will reuse the read thread in `IOManager`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as:\r\n- `SpilledBufferOrEventSequenceTest.java`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (**no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (**no**)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**no**)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (**no**)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (**no**)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* Expose an internal method `execute(StreamGraph)` of `StreamExecutionEnvironment`. So the pluggable runner could get a chance to set properties of `StreamGraph`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Add a new abstract method `execute(StreamGraph)` of `StreamExecutionEnvironment`\r\n* Make `execute(jobName)` of `StreamExecutionEnvironment` as an implementation since all subclasses have same logic\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* This change is already covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery:

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Currently, the python method `DataTypes.VARCHAR(length)` assumes default value `1` for argument `length` and we should align with Java and don't provide default value for it as currently the length is not respected in Planner and users will easily write programs which can run in the current version and won't run in the future versions after the argument `length` is respected.*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Remove the default value for the utilities methods of DataTypes*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Currently, the python DateType is converted by an `int` which indicates the days passed since 1970-1-1 and then the Java side will create a Java Date by call `new Date(days * 86400)`. As we know that the Date constructor expected milliseconds since 1970-1-1 00:00:00 GMT and so we should convert `days * 86400` to GMT milliseconds. This PR will fix this issue.*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add method getOffsetFromLocalMillis to deal with the offset calculation of the local timezone and use the calculated offset when creating the Date object.*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd the generation of HiveTableSink from from a Hive table\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - Added the logic of generation of HiveTableSink from from a Hive table\r\n  - Refactored and simplified HiveTableSink related code\r\n  - Added test for the logic\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is verified with existing and new test cases.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yno)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes )\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nInstead of using `DescriptiveStatistics` and its `ResizableDoubleArray` storage back-end, implement an own circular array based on a fixed-size double array

It also ensures that access is synchronized which `ResizableDoubleArray` does not guarantee.\r\n\r\nPerformance results:\r\n1. only adding values to the histogram\r\n```\r\n    Benchmark

- Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **no**\r\n  - The serializers: **no**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **maybe** (histograms are used by latency markers only but may be used by users)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: **no**\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: **no**\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? **no**\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? **JavaDocs**\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-25T23:09:29Z","updated_at":"2019-08-23T10:23:10Z","closed_at":"2019-08-21T15:08:18Z","merged_at":"2019-08-21T15:08:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"f57a615c1e7a0b01d1984b3c7637be7f5b63d696","assignee":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273342730,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzQyNzMw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Metrics","name":"component=Runtime/Metrics","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8888/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8888/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8888/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/7aa48c0681761e99379831d0549360462caa4817","head":{"label":"NicoK:f12983","ref":"f12983","sha":"7aa48c0681761e99379831d0549360462caa4817","user":{"login":"NicoK","id":213026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzAyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK","html_url":"https://github.com/NicoK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":72781206,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3Mjc4MTIwNg==","name":"flink","full_name":"NicoK/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NicoK","id":213026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzAyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK","html_url":"https://github.com/NicoK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/received_events","type":"

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nInstead of redirecting `DescriptiveStatisticsHistogramStatistics` calls to `DescriptiveStatistics`, it now takes a point-in-time snapshot using an own `UnivariateStatistic` implementation that\r\n1. calculates min, max, mean, and standard deviation in one go (as opposed to four iterations over the values array!)\r\n2. caches pivots for the percentile calculation to speed up retrieval of multiple percentiles/quartiles\r\n\r\nAs a result, this roughly increases value retrieval performance by 120% when accessing typical statistics in a metrics reporter, e.g. the InfluxDB reporter: count, min, max, mean, stddev, p50, p75, p95, p98, p99, p999.\r\n\r\nPerformance results:\r\n1. only adding values to the histogram\r\n```\r\n

Brief change log\r\n\r\n- create a custom `CommonMetricsSnapshot implements UnivariateStatistic`\r\n-- calculates min, max, mean, and stddev in one go\r\n-- caches values inside a percentile implementation for optimised retrieval of multiple percentiles \r\n- create a point-in-time histogram snapshot during creation of `DescriptiveStatisticsHistogramStatistics`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n`DescriptiveStatisticsHistogram#getCount()` only returned the number of currently\r\nstored elements, not the total number seen. This is different from the docs in `Histogram` and the `DropwizardHistogramWrapper` implementation and fixed by this PR.\r\n\r\n-> follow-up PR: #8877\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- extend `HistogramStatistics` with an additional `AtomicLong` to count the number of elements seen\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- add an abstract unit test for verifying any `Histogram` implementation based on\r\nthe previous test from `DropwizardFlinkHistogramWrapperTest`\r\n- create `DescriptiveStatisticsHistogramTest` to run this test with `DescriptiveStatisticsHistogram`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **yes** (test-jar, test-scope `flink-metrics` -> `flink-runtime`)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **no**\r\n  - The serializers: **no**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **no**\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: **no**\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: **no**\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? **no**\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? **not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFlink triggers all panes belonging to one window at the same time. In other words, all panes are aligned and their triggers all fire simultaneously, causing the spiking workload effect. This pull request adds WindowStagger to generate staggering offset for each window assignment at runtime, so the workloads are distributed across time. Hence each window assignment is based on window size, window offset and staggering offset (generated in runtime).\r\n\r\nThis change only modifies TumblingProcessingTimeWindows, will send out other windows change in other PRs. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add WindowStagger for generating staggering offsets*\r\n  - *Enable TumblingProcessingTimeWindows to generate staggering offsets if user enabled*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *TumblingProcessingTimeWindowsTest*.\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added unit tests for WindowStagger*\r\n  - *Validated the change by running in our clusters with 3500 task managers in total on a stateful streaming program using sliding and tumbling windowing. Some dashboards are shown below*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12971856/stagger_window_delay.png)\r\n![](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12971857/stagger_window_throughput.png)\r\n![](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12971859/stagger_window.png)\r\n\r\n*some system metrics*\r\n\r\n![buffers_in_queue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10646097/60139232-00f29d80-9762-11e9-84f4-3bfbde28c028.png)\r\n![buffer_usage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10646097/60139234-03ed8e00-9762-11e9-99d1-de845d02a8c6.png)\r\n![output_record_rate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10646097/60139237-064fe800-9762-11e9-959d-2db96c7f7bf6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes, TumblingProcessingTimeWindows(potentially all WindowAssigners)\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): don't know, probably no ? \r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the implementation of the `BoundedBlockingResultpartition` and adds alternative implementations to evaluate.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation (based on memory mapped files) turned out to have stability issues under large scale and memory pressure. Big thanks to Yingjie Cao for testing/benchmarking this at scale.\r\n\r\nThe theory for the cause of the stability issue is that processes may stall when trying to allocate memory, because first memory would have to be freed by evicting a page from the memory mapped file and writing it to disk. This lazy persistence is the problem.\r\n\r\nWe implemented and tested different approaches:\r\n  - `MMAP`: Current implementation\r\n  - `FILE`: Directly writes to a file and reads from the file, so no lazy writing causing stalls\r\n  - `FILE_MMAP`: Directly writes to a file and maps the file only for reading. This also has no lazy write (on page eviction)\r\n\r\nTests concluded that the `FILE_MMAP` variant is stable and the implementation of choice.\r\nThe PR still includes the other implementations (with tests) for future experiments.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Factors out the implementation of the bounded data storage from the `BoundedBlockingResultpartition`\r\n  - Add the implementations for `FILE`, `MMAP`, `FILE_MMAP`\r\n  - Generify tests to cover all three implementations (through test bases / parameterized tests)\r\n  - Change `ResultPartitionFactory` to instantiate the `FILE_MMAP` variant for blocking result partitions.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - Any batch job (DataSet API) with blocking shuffles can be used to verify this. Set the `ExecutionMode` to `BATCH_FORCED`.\r\n  - The batch job should have multiple TaskManagers to trigger the Netty shuffle code paths\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRemove the constraint that lookup join needs a primary key or index key\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Remove `DefinedPrimaryKey` and `DefinedIndexes`\r\n- Remove the primary key and index key validation\r\n- Adapt the tests\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nSome unit tests and integration tests are adapted.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn some occasions, `Histogram#getStatistics()` was called multiple times to retrieve different statistics. However, at least the Dropwizard implementation has some constant overhead per call and we should maybe rather interpret this method as returning a point-in-time snapshot of the histogram in order to get consistent values when querying them.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this PR is based on #8886.\r\n-> follow-up PR: #8884\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- adapt prometheus reporter\r\n- adapt JMX and

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo support writing to Hive tables with complex data types.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Support writing ARRAY, MAP and STRUCT types in `HiveTableOutputFormat`.\r\n  - Use `HiveObjectConversion` to convert Flink object to Hive object in `HiveTableOutputFormat`.\r\n  - Fixed some issue with creating Hive TypeInfo for struct type.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded new unit test.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis introduces a utility for checking logical types for casting. The goal is to be SQL standard compliant. The standard cast specification is quite large, it might be that the code misses some functionality which we can still fix in the future. This code was also inspired by Calcite's `org.apache.calcite.sql.type.SqlTypeAssignmentRules`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Utility for casting added\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is currently tied to 2 jiras:\r\nFLINK-12977\r\nPort CsvTableSource and CsvTableSink to api-java-bridge\r\nFLINK-12978\r\nSupport LookupableTableSource for CsvTableSource\r\nThese changes can be separated into 2 PRs if it's required.\r\n\r\nCurrently, CsvTableSource and CsvTableSink are in flink-planner. If they can be moved to `flink-table-api-java-bridge`, so that blink planner can reuse them.\r\n\r\nThis should be a straightforward move, no API should be changed. And we should rewrite them in Java, because api-java-bridge doesn't depends on Scala.\r\n\r\nCsvTableSource is a highly used source in demo and testing. It will be great if it also supports LookupableTableSource so that it can be used in temporal table join (act like a external dimension table).\r\n\r\nThe lookupable csv source implementation should be tested in blink planner, because currently only blink support lookup.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nPort CsvTableSource to flink-table-api-java-bridge and rewrite it in Java.\r\nSupport LookupableTableSource in the new CsvTableSource.\r\nModify two test cases since they use the constructor of CsvTableSource which is exposed in the Scala version but now hidden in the new Java one.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as TableSourceTest, TableSourceValidationTest, ExternalCatalogSchemaTest.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* Bump checkstyle to 8.14 since 8.12 is no longer supported\r\n\r\n* The description below is copied from JIRA issue\r\n>The descriptions of checkstyle of IDE setup document [1] is out of date. In the current checkstyle plugin (v5.28.0), there is no option of 8.12 in checkstyle setting dialog box. The version 8.12 is no longer supported, checkstyle suggests to upgrade to 8.14 \"due to lack of breaking changes\" [2].\r\nIt would confuse the user that document says \"This step is important, don’t skip it!\", but user can not find the 8.12 option.\r\nSince there are still some modules do not support checkstyle plugin, I have just manually checked some modules under 8.14 version. It shows OK.\r\ncc Chesnay Schepler, is there a better way to check the bumping?\r\n\r\n>1. https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/flinkDev/ide_setup.html#checkstyle-for-java\r\n>2.

about the checkstyle version\r\n* Update pom.xml about the checkstyle version\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* This change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request changes the processing that the input reaches the end to comply with the following `InputSelectable` contract.\r\n\r\n- When the input being read reaches the end, the runtime must call `nextSelection()` to determine the next input to be read.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  -  Uses invoking `InputSelectable#nextSelection()` to replace the assignment on the input selection in `StreamTwoInputSelectableProcessor#checkFinished()` . The input selection should been switched in `endInput()` by the operator.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as `StreamTaskSelectiveReadingTest`, `StreamTaskSelectiveReadingITCase`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This pull request adds pip support for pyflink. Execute `python setup.py sdist` in `flink-python` directory will generate the pyflink package in the `dist` directory. The package is pip-installable and contains all python code of pyflink and all files in `build-target` directory. Users can install it through `pip install package_file_name.tar.gz`. If installation is success, users can import pyflink to their projects, open a pyflink shell by enter `pyflink-shell.sh [mode]` and no need to manually install a java version of flink before using pyflink.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Allows pyflink to be pip installed.*\r\n  - *Upgrade `find_flink_home.py`, `config.sh` and add `find-flink-home.sh`, make sure `pyflink-shell.sh` could run on pip installed pyflink.*\r\n  - *Add tests and documentation for pip installation.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\nrunning `flink-python/dev/lint-python.sh`, if the exit code is 0 then the change is OK.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR adds commented-out defaults for catalogs to sql client yaml file, to make it easier for users to adopt. This is done similar to how existing defaults of tables and functions is written, e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#==============================================================================\r\n# Tables\r\n#==============================================================================\r\n\r\n# Define tables here such as sources, sinks, views, or temporal tables.\r\n\r\ntables: [] # empty list\r\n# A typical table source definition looks like:\r\n# - name: ...\r\n#   type: source-table\r\n#   connector: ...\r\n#   format: ...\r\n#   schema: ...\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n#==============================================================================\r\n# User-defined functions\r\n#==============================================================================\r\n\r\n# Define scalar, aggregate, or table functions here.\r\n\r\nfunctions: [] # empty list\r\n# A typical function definition looks like:\r\n# - name: ...\r\n#   from: class\r\n#   class: ...\r\n#   constructor: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage. And verified manually\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`:  (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

Currently, the thread reference is set in `StreamTask` instantiation time, this conflicts with some `StreamTask` tests, as they were creating the task instance in a different (non task's) thread.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - `StreamTaskTest` is rewritten to properly run a task under test, instead of overriding some fields via `Whitebox`;\r\n  - the rest of tests in `flink-streaming-java` are rewritten to delegate task instance creation to the task's main thread.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\nRunning the tests in `flink-streaming-java` and `flink-streaming-scala` should be green. Also, running the same tests with changes in #8692 should be green.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR sits on top of #8692 and integrates the ``AsyncWaitOperator`` with the mailbox model. This PR keeps backwards compatibility with the legacy sources and also honors that timers and checkpoints are not yet using the mailbox. This means, there is some followup cleanup that can be done once the mailbox effort is further progressed and I left some `TODO` comments as markers. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Integrate `AsyncWaitOperator` and the companion `Emitter` with the mailbox model.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing unit tests and IT cases for the `AsyncWaitOperator`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix shadowed NPE in elasticsearch sink connector\r\n\r\nin our product env, met NPE when using flink connector write data, but the NPE was shadowed.\r\n```\r\nFailed Elasticsearch bulk request: null\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nhotfix the logger\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no) no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no) no\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no) no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented) not

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request is base on #8704 and #8740. It dynamically allocates the TaskExecutor's resources to the slots on it. FTM, managed memory in slot resource profiles is set to the actual size, the rest are set to `ANY` that matches any request (see #8704).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- 0d3245b7462d157895257750988c46416feb4bb0: Introduce `merge` and `subtract` calculations in `ResourceProfile`, and corresponding tests. These calculations are needed for bookkeeping task executors' resources.\r\n- 4b822d6f68eae559c07220949da894c7811762c7 - 11262902755a455ca7ff0926ca7e8afd323ee69d: Changes on the task executor side.\r\n  - 4b822d6f68eae559c07220949da894c7811762c7: Add argument `allocationResourceProfile` in `TaskExecutorGateway#requestSlot` which describes the dynamically allocated slot resources. Task executors need to record the allocation resource profiles so they can:\r\n    1. offer slots with requested resources to job masters, and\r\n    2. report allocated resources to the resource manager so it can recover the task executor resource bookkeepings after a failover.\r\n  - 1b09722d03d64025e4e184845cfc0d43218fa285: `TaskExecutor` checks the requested allocation resource profiles and rejects those that exceed its current available resources. This could happen due to asynchronous information on RM/TM. \r\n    - E.g., RM requests slot1 from the TE, then receives an outdated slot report from the TE showing that slot1 is free. After that RM requests slot2 from the TE. At this moment, RM1 believes that the TE has enough available for slot2 because it thinks slot1 is free, but the TE may not have enough resources because slot1 is actually allocated.\r\n  - e90d462c530814bee19efe0203a895d78ad1d2f9: `TaskExecutor` offers slot with allocation resource profile.\r\n  - 231d5691bddbcf5c207d3edcf6d86fc00d52b5ac: `TaskExecutor` report slot status with allocation resource profile.\r\n  - 11262902755a455ca7ff0926ca7e8afd323ee69d: Add `TaskExecutorTest#testAllocationResourceProfile` that validates `TaskExecutor` maintains allocation resource profiles of slots properly.\r\n- 29d44b40f5c245ad606e06cddcd71ea3e8ff3b7b - e2ee9de9847b219a3ad1f07d7a023f4dc1746e1b: Changes on the resource manager side.\r\n  - 29d44b40f5c245ad606e06cddcd71ea3e8ff3b7b: `SlotManager` groups `PendingTaskManagerSlots` according to whether they should be on the same `TaskExecutor`, and matches registered slots accordingly. We need this change to bookkeep available resources for pending task executors in subsequent commit.\r\n  - 4e05a878f37ceba81e65a3ae6c3d9e28f5251dfa: Update `SlotManagerTest#testPendingTaskManagerSlotCompletion`. The original assumption that pending task slots are completed independently from each other no longer holds.\r\n  - 85d58f2641fdbae4d1d349010552fe11b8d723bf: Introduce the data structure `TaskExecutorResourceBookkeeper` for bookkeeping total/available/allocated resources of registered and pending task executors.\r\n  - 35591c5efe5f52c1cfa111a959a744a06c4ce9e9: `SlotManager` bookkeeps task executors' resources.\r\n  - 9b6cac6d719e04d07a169930635e36f8661a8674: With dynamic slot resource allocation, resource managers on Yarn/Mesos should be able to start new worker for resource requests that is larger than the default resources of one slot but not larger than the total resources of slots per task executor.\r\n  - e2ee9de9847b219a3ad1f07d7a023f4dc1746e1b: Add `SlotManagerTest#testBookkeepingTaskExecutorResources` that validates `SlotManager` bookkeeps resources of task executors properly.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - Add `TaskExecutorTest#testAllocationResourceProfile` that validates `TaskExecutor` maintains allocation resource profiles of slots properly.\r\n  - Add `SlotManagerTest#testBookkeepingTaskExecutorResources` that validates `SlotManager` bookkeeps resources of task executors properly.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is to introduce the bookkeeping logic for the shared slots and colocated slots. It is a part of introducing the fine-grained resource management for Flink and is based on #8704 #8840 and #8846 . Based on the current design, a task will always request the resource according to its own resource need, and the returned slot may be larger than requested resource. Therefore, it leaves chance for slot sharing and colocation group.\r\n\r\nTo considering resources during slot sharing and colocation, the resource already requested must be recorded to ensure the resource requests of the assigned tasks do not exceed the total resource of the slot.  \r\n\r\nThe first step is to bookkeep the resources inside the slot sharing tree structure. A variable is added to each MultiTaskSlot to record the resources already requests by all its descendants. \r\n\r\nFor the allocating, there are in general two scenarios:\r\n1. The underlying slot has been allocated. \r\n2. The underlying slot is requested but not allocated.\r\n\r\nFor the first type of slots, the allocation is modified to use the remaining resource of the slot instead of the total resource. For slot sharing, if no allocated slots can be fulfilled, it will turn to slots in requesting or request new slot as before. For colocation, if the slot has been allocated but it cannot fulfill the current request, then the request will never be fulfilled and will fail directly.\r\n\r\nFor the second type of slots, since the total resource of the slots are not known before they get allocated, the requests will be recorded temporarily. When the underlying slot get allocated, the requests will be checked whether they can be fulfilled. Some requests may be failed due to over-allocation. For the failed tests:\r\n1. If only a part of requests are failed, they may succeed if requests without others, therefore these requests can be retry. The colocation requests are considered as a whole instead of the single task requests.\r\n2. If all the requests can not be fulfilled, this case can only happen when we request to RM according to the resource of a task in a colocation group, but the return slot can not fulfill the colocation group and any other requests in the same sharing group. Since for static resource matching this exception cannot be recovered, and to avoid infinite retrying, currently we do not allow the requests to retry. \r\n\r\n3. If the request cannot be fulfilled by RM, RM will return an error directly and the requests will be failed as before.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. cfc25388147495a33ba9897a439db44dfc8b8c59 introduces merge/subtract on `ResourceProfile` and 122399a7caa515c1b4390cac7d092e897f0aebe0 enhance the tests.\r\n2. 4f81f937ba1d0900bdfacf9b6d0253cc931535cf changes the default resource in ResourceSpec from DEFAULT to UNKNOWN.\r\n3. 62388dba3fb3e36b5f2fa7bcd473dc998c642639 disables jobs who only have parts of resources configured. This ensure the resources of job vertices are either all UNKNOWN or all configured.\r\n4. 869e800e12ffc33cf6585f94194277076c2009b9 revises the codes of the class of Resource.java.\r\n\r\nBased on the above commits,\r\n\r\n5. c26aa1763187221961b76a68635a8fc75947eff7 maintains the resource requested in the MutiTaskSlot, which indicates the total resources requested by all its descendant.\r\n6. 2f6add017d250c520265f98ba21b938d699cff9e adds the resource checking logic when the underlying slot is resolved. The over-allocated requests will be marked fail. The over-allocated requests will iff some requests are fulfilled by the underlying slot in `SchedulerImpl`. For the co-located requests, it also adds the checking of whether the remaining resource is possible to fulfill the requests if the underlying slot is already resolved.\r\n7. c9cf151a68344a2aac328983593a7dd07a267ac5 modifies the interface of `SlotSelectionStrategy` to also pass the remaining resource of the underlying slot. The implementation of the strategies should use the remaining resource instead of the total resource.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added tests that validate the calculated of requested resource for the hierarchical structure of MultiTaskSlot/SingleTaskSlot. \r\n  - Added tests that validate the routine to fail the over-allocated requests when the underlying slot is resolved.\r\n  - Added tests that validate the retry logic after failing due to over-allocation.\r\n  - Added tests that validate the failure of the co-located requests if the slot is not enough for all the co-located tasks.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **no**\r\n  - The serializers: **no**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **no**\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: **yes**\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: **no**\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? **no**\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-22T13:24:34Z","updated_at":"2019-06-25T11:53:45Z","closed_at":"2019-06-25T11:53:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4e7313c277909a401248af5893d6a89b2da9dce5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8836/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8836/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8836/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/f5441ab966c2fe0a68e1619147ec35dc7de96aa5","head":{"label":"cool321:master","ref":"master","sha":"f5441ab966c2fe0a68e1619147ec35dc7de96aa5","user":{"login":"cool321","id":34114454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTE0NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34114454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cool321","html_url":"https://github.com/cool321","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cool321/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cool321/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cool321/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cool321/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cool321/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cool321/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cool321/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cool321/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cool321/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":193207779,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMyMDc3Nzk=","name":"flink","full_name":"cool321/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cool321","id":34114454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTE0NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34114454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cool321","html_url":"https://github.com/cool321","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cool321/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cool321/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cool321/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cool321/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cool321/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cool321/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cool321/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cool321/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cool321/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cool321/flink","description":"Apache
