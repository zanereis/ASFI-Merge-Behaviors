The problem was the result of passing encrypted property values to migration methods, which subsequently resulted in encrypting a value that was already encrypted.\r\n\r\nThe resolution decrypts original property values prior to registering created extensions so that subsequent property migration methods have access to the decrypted property values.\r\n\r\nThe resolution can be verified using the `InvokeHTTP` Processor and creating a sensitive dynamic property named `Authorization`. After creating the property with an arbitrary value, restarting NiFi maintains the same length for the encrypted string in `flow.json.gz`, as opposed to growing the encrypted string length after each restart operation. New test methods for the Versioned Component Synchronizer also verify that migration methods for Processors receive decrypted values. \r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12332](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12332) Removes the `nifi-toolkit-flowfile-repo` module containing a command for repairing FlowFile repository endings.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12192](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12192) Adds code coverage for unit tests using the [JaCoCo Maven Plugin](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/maven.html) reporting to [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/).\r\n\r\nCodecov provides free reporting capabilities for open source projects and enables integration with GitHub workflows using the [Codecov Action](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action).\r\n\r\nThe implementation of code coverage reporting updates the GitHub `ci-workflow` to run the Ubuntu Linux Java 21 job with JaCoCo coverage enabled. The JaCoCo plugin writes an aggregated report in XML, using the `nifi-code-coverage` module to aggregate coverage information based on an enumeration of dependencies. The Maven module is necessary for selecting and aggregating coverage reporting information. The Codecov Action reads the JaCoCo XML and sends it to Codecov for processing.\r\n\r\nThe JaCoCo prepare-agent goal updates the `argLine` property, which required removing custom locale information from the Ubuntu Linux job, instead relying on the default settings of the GitHub runner.\r\n\r\nUpdates include adding a Codecov badge to the README for displaying coverage on the main branch.\r\n\r\nCurrent code coverage information is available in [Codecov for this feature branch](https://app.codecov.io/gh/exceptionfactory/nifi/tree/NIFI-12192).\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12261](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12261) Adds new `SchemaReferenceReader` and `SchemaReferenceWriter` Controller Service interfaces in the `nifi-schema-registry-service-api` module. These new interface allow for migration from internal implementations of `SchemaAccessStrategy` and `SchemaAccessWriter` to standard Controller Service classes.\r\n\r\nChanges include introducing Confluent-Encoded implementations of the Reader and Writer services, maintaining existing support for the Confluent Schema Registry [Wire Format](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/fundamentals/serdes-develop/index.html#wire-format) for encoded schema identifiers.\r\n\r\nChanges also include removing references to the Hortonworks Schema Access Strategy and Schema Access Writer implementations, aligning with the removal of the Hortonworks Schema Registry service. This provides a consistent approach to future maintenance for both Schema Registry services and associated Schema Reference handling.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking

related to the change associated with this issue: \"[NIFI-8223](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-8223) - PutDatabaseRecord should use table column datatype instead of field datatype.\" \r\n\r\nThis issue introduced a change in the data transformation logic in the PutDatabaseRecord processor, which converts a field (e.g., of type string) to the data type of its corresponding database column.\r\n\r\nThis is causing problems because our field in the database is of type datetime2 and our string is \"2023-10-19 14:14:59.999314\" However, the processor is converting it to \"2023-10-19 14:14:59\" without microseconds, despite setting the format in the csvreader.\r\n\r\nTo address this, we have made an adjustment in the PutDatabaseRecord processor so that users at the processor level can choose whether to apply the transformation to the database column type or maintain the Nifi format.\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12313](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12313)\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12297](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12297) Standardizes file path resolution in the NiFi Registry File System Bundle and Flow Persistence Providers, as well as the file-backed Registry client for system tests.\r\n\r\nThese changes replace string concatenation and related strategies with a standard approach using Java NIO Paths.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12311](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12311) Removes custom module support from the Advanced user interface for the `JoltTransformJSON` Processor. The changes do not impact runtime behavior of the `JoltTransformJSON` Processor, but only remove support for user-initiated validation in the Advanced user interface. This change avoids potential issues related to loading external classes through a custom class loader. The advanced user interface displays a message indicating `Custom Transform not supported for advanced validation` when attempting to run validation with the `Custom` option selected.\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12290](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12290) Migrates from Quartz to Spring Framework [CronExpression](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/support/CronExpression.html) for Cron scheduling of components.\r\n\r\nThe Quartz library relies on `java.util.Date` and has several legacy dependencies including HikariCP and C3P0 which are not necessary for project operations.\r\n\r\nThe Spring Framework 5.3 [introduced new Cron Expression](https://spring.io/blog/2020/11/10/new-in-spring-5-3-improved-cron-expressions) capabilities based on `java.time` classes that follow standard Unix crontab conventions.\r\n\r\nThe differences from Quartz are minimal, but include the removal of the optional Year field, and the change from 1-7 to 0-7 for numeric Day of Week references.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12276](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12276) Upgrades the OWASP Dependency Check Plugin from 8.4.0 to 8.4.2 and addresses a number of vulnerability findings.\r\n\r\nChanges include introducing a new `dependency-check` GitHub workflow that runs on a daily schedule to evaluate project dependencies against published vulnerabilities. The workflow prints findings at the end of the build step and also produces an HTML report that can be downloaded for review.\r\n\r\nAddressing current findings for the main project branch resulted in the following incremental dependency changes:\r\n\r\n- Upgraded Janino Commons Compiler from 3.1.9 to 3.1.10\r\n- Upgraded Azure SDK BOM from 1.2.16 to 1.2.17\r\n- Upgraded GCP SDK BOM from 26.17.0 to 26.25.0\r\n- Upgraded AWS SDK from 1.12.550 to 1.12.573\r\n- Upgraded Hazelcast from 5.3.2 to 5.3.5\r\n- Upgraded Jersey from 2.40 to 2.41\r\n- Upgraded Camel Salesforce from 3.14.5 to 3.14.9\r\n- Unified ZooKeeper versioning on 3.9.1\r\n- Applied Groovy 2.4.21 to Hive 3 and Iceberg components\r\n- Applied gRPC version 1.59.0 to Asana components\r\n- Applied Jettison 1.5.4 to Atlas and Hive 3 components\r\n- Managed JUnit 4 version to 4.13.2 for MockWebServer\r\n- Excluded HBase libraries from Hive 3 following Iceberg approach\r\n- Excluded Htrace from HBase components\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include removing non-applicable suppression settings and adding new suppression settings for vulnerabilities that do not have a direct impact on project components.\r\n\r\nAt the time of this writing, the dependency check report flags the following dependencies with associated vulnerabilities:\r\n\r\n```\r\nguava-19.0.jar (pkg:maven/com.google.guava/guava@19.0, cpe:2.3:a:google:guava:19.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*) : CVE-2018-10237\r\nhadoop-client-runtime-3.3.6.jar/META-INF/maven/com.google.protobuf/protobuf-java/pom.xml (pkg:maven/com.google.protobuf/protobuf-java@3.7.1, cpe:2.3:a:google:protobuf-java:3.7.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*, cpe:2.3:a:protobuf:protobuf:3.7.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*) : CVE-2022-3171, CVE-2022-3509, CVE-2021-22569\r\nhadoop-client-runtime-3.3.6.jar/META-INF/maven/net.minidev/json-smart/pom.xml (pkg:maven/net.minidev/json-smart@1.3.2, cpe:2.3:a:json-smart_project:json-smart:1.3.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*, cpe:2.3:a:json-smart_project:json-smart-v1:1.3.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*) : CVE-2021-31684, CVE-2023-1370\r\nhadoop-client-runtime-3.3.6.jar/META-INF/maven/org.apache.avro/avro/pom.xml (pkg:maven/org.apache.avro/avro@1.7.7) : CVE-2023-39410\r\nhadoop-client-runtime-3.3.6.jar/META-INF/maven/org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-io/pom.xml (pkg:maven/org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-io@9.4.51.v20230217, cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:jetty:9.4.51:20230217:*:*:*:*:*:*, cpe:2.3:a:jetty:jetty:9.4.51:20230217:*:*:*:*:*:*) : CVE-2023-44487, CVE-2023-40167, CVE-2023-36479, CVE-2023-41900\r\nhive-exec-3.1.3.jar/META-INF/maven/com.google.guava/guava/pom.xml (pkg:maven/com.google.guava/guava@11.0.2, cpe:2.3:a:google:guava:11.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*) : CVE-2018-10237\r\nhive-exec-3.1.3.jar/META-INF/maven/org.apache.avro/avro/pom.xml (pkg:maven/org.apache.avro/avro@1.8.2) : CVE-2023-39410\r\njson-io-2.5.1.jar (pkg:maven/com.cedarsoftware/json-io@2.5.1) : CVE-2023-34610\r\nkaml-0.20.0.jar (pkg:maven/com.charleskorn.kaml/kaml@0.20.0, cpe:2.3:a:kaml_project:kaml:0.20.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*) : CVE-2023-28118, CVE-2021-39194\r\nlibthrift-0.9.3.jar (pkg:maven/org.apache.thrift/libthrift@0.9.3, cpe:2.3:a:apache:thrift:0.9.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*) : CVE-2018-1320, CVE-2019-0205, CVE-2020-13949\r\nnetty-3.10.6.Final.jar (pkg:maven/io.netty/netty@3.10.6.Final, cpe:2.3:a:netty:netty:3.10.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*) : CVE-2019-20444, CVE-2019-20445, CVE-2019-16869, CVE-2020-11612, CVE-2021-37136, CVE-2021-37137, CVE-2021-43797, CVE-2021-21295, CVE-2021-21409, CVE-2021-21290\r\nprotobuf-java-2.5.0.jar (pkg:maven/com.google.protobuf/protobuf-java@2.5.0, cpe:2.3:a:google:protobuf-java:2.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*, cpe:2.3:a:protobuf:protobuf:2.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*) : CVE-2022-3171, CVE-2022-3509, CVE-2021-22569\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs shown in the dependency names, most of the findings relate to shaded dependencies included in Hadoop and Hive 3 libraries.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12287](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12287) Standardizes skipping of Sources and Javadoc JAR generation for NAR and WAR modules.\r\n\r\nModern versions of the Maven Source Plugin use `maven.source.skip` as the property name for skipping sources. As a result of historical usage of `source.skip` properties in individual NAR files, recent releases published sources JAR files for each NAR.\r\n\r\nChanges include adding `nar-packaging` and `war-packaging` profiles to the root Maven configuration, setting `maven.source.skip` and `maven.javadoc.skip` to `true` for the `nar` and `war` packaging types. Centralizing this configuration removes the need for setting these properties in individual NAR configurations.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull

Although, this profile is named differently because it is now active by default. Instead of \"no-swagger-ui\" it is now called \"include-swagger-ui\". Deactivating the profile (non-default option) is achieved using `-P'!include-swagger-ui'`. Deactivating the profile will prevent the build from attempting to download swagger assets if network connectivity is not available at build time.\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12283](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12283)\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12282](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12282) Moves Apache Hadoop extensions and several other components to optional build profiles.\r\n\r\nChanges include the following:\r\n\r\n- Moved Hadoop and Parquet NARs to include-hadoop\r\n- Moved HBase NARs to include-hbase\r\n- Moved Kudu NAR to include-kudu\r\n- Moved Solr NAR to include-solr\r\n\r\nApache Hadoop support varies between different vendors, which already requires custom build profiles. Both Apache Kudu and Apache Parquet components depend on several Hadoop libraries. Apache HBase and Apache Solr components each exceed 50 MB for the size of bundled NARs.\r\n\r\nMoving these selected extensions to optional build profiles reduces the convenience binary build to around 950 MB.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

Relationship has been added for consistency with `PutElasticsearchRecord`, along with `original` (automatically renamed from `success`) and `errors`.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12272](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12272) Adds a `PrincipalFormatter` interface and `StandardPrincipalFormatter` implementation that retrieves and formats Certificate Subject and Issuer Distinguished Names according to [RFC 1779](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1779).\r\n\r\nThis approach preserves compatibility with the historical `getSubjectDN()` and `getIssuerDN()` methods from `X509Certificate` while using the recommended `getSubjectX500Principal()` and `getIssuerX500Principal()` methods.\r\n\r\nThese changes restore compatibility with existing NiFi versions, recently changed for [NIFI-12142](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12142).\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12266](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12266) Adds `nifi-standard-shared-nar` and `nifi-standard-shared-bom` modules for managing a common set dependencies for most extension components.\r\n\r\nThe `nifi-standard-shared-nar` includes JAR libraries that are applicable many extension components, and has a parent NAR of `nifi-standard-services-api-nar` to align with existing parent NAR configurations.\r\n\r\nThe `nifi-standard-shared-bom` sets the `provided` scope for common dependencies and serves as the parent Maven module for extension bundles that make use of the new `nifi-standard-shared-nar`.\r\n\r\nMost of the changes include replacing `nifi-standard-services-api-nar` with `nifi-standard-shared-nar` in extension NAR configurations, and changing the parent module to `nifi-standard-shared-bom`. The parent module approach is necessary to inherit the `provided` scope definition instead of the default `compile` scoped set in the root Maven configuration.\r\n\r\nThe shared dependencies include the following libraries:\r\n\r\n- Apache Commons libraries such as commons-lang3 and commons-io\r\n- Bouncy Castle Provider and PKI extensions\r\n- Jackson JSON core and databind\r\n- Caffeine Cache\r\n- OkHttp with Kotlin standard libraries\r\n- Netty 4 Handler and common libraries\r\n\r\nThe introduction of these changes removes over 350 MB of duplicated dependencies from the convenience binary assembly.\r\n\r\nThis approach allows extension components to set the appropriate parent module and NAR dependencies for shared runtime versions, or maintain `nifi-standard-services-api-nar` as the parent NAR and use alternative versions when necessary.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X]

By default, that filter removes\r\nall objects with a null value, all empty objects, and all empty arrays.  This PR supports a new Property\r\non the JSLTTransformJSON processor that lets users configure that filter, in case the default behavior\r\nis not desired.\r\n\r\nAlso, this PR fixes a potential NPE in OnShutdown if the cache has never been created.\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12121](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12121)\r\n\r\nThis PR should cherry-pick cleanly to the nifi-1.x support branch,

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12252](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12252) Removes the legacy `FileAuthorizer` implementation, which provided backward compatibility for translating historical user and role mappings to Access Policies. Changes also include removing the `Legacy Authorized Users File` property from `FileUserGroupProvider`. These capabilities supported upgrading from NiFi version prior to version 1.0.0.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include removing unused methods from `FileAccessPolicyProvider` and `FileUserGroupProvider` that are not necessary with the removal of support for the legacy users configuration.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n###
