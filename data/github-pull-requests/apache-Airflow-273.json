Jira\r\n\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3704\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nFrom Celery 4.1 (current Airflow is using 4.1.1), `broker_use_ssl` argument starts to support Redis (earlier this argument is only supported when pyamqp is used for broker) (reference: http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#broker-use-ssl).\r\n\r\nBut the details are different when user is using pyaqmp or Redis.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation will pass wrong arguments when user is using Redis as broker and has chosen SSL_ACTIVE = True. Two possibilities:\r\n- if some exception is raised, user will not be able to SSL protection when they are using Redis, even though this is already supported by Celery.\r\n- this may work and skip wrong configuration silently, and user may think they have set up the SSL protection while it's not working.\r\n\r\nNeither is acceptable.\r\n\r\nThis PR has enabled using SSL protection when Redis is used as broker for CeleryExecutor.\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-14T14:15:51Z","updated_at":"2019-01-14T23:38:43Z","closed_at":"2019-01-14T17:34:45Z","merged_at":"2019-01-14T17:34:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"7b2834e06857d2388dd9aed908f510b82f062e72","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4521/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4521/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4521/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/3348630bf96375d757e10ced6f97dd9eae842ccf","head":{"label":"XD-DENG:enalble_broker_use_ssl_for_redis_as_broker","ref":"enalble_broker_use_ssl_for_redis_as_broker","sha":"3348630bf96375d757e10ced6f97dd9eae842ccf","user":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":142260154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDIyNjAxNTQ=","name":"airflow","full_name":"XD-DENG/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3703\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n`KubernetesPodOperator` supports `hostNetwork` but sometimes in some environments it is necessary to set dnsPolicy for some pods because your cluster can use some unusual DNS configurations.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an option to set `dnsPolicy` for a pod.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nKubernetesPodOperatorTest.test_pod_dnspolicy\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-14T12:57:53Z","updated_at":"2019-06-21T15:23:21Z","closed_at":"2019-06-21T15:23:21Z","merged_at":"2019-06-21T15:23:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"d5a0e9427ff4b6855c1d040fc458e984064c25ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dimberman","id":2644098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman","html_url":"https://github.com/dimberman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4520/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4520/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4520/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/adde43ffb04a0ed3f2004ded81e3749e96acd9a5","head":{"label":"pubnative:support_dns_policy_kubernetes","ref":"support_dns_policy_kubernetes","sha":"adde43ffb04a0ed3f2004ded81e3749e96acd9a5","user":{"login":"pubnative","id":7806659,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc4MDY2NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7806659?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pubnative","html_url":"https://github.com/pubnative","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pubnative/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pubnative/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pubnative/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pubnative/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pubnative/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pubnative/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pubnative/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pubnative/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pubnative/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":162455957,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjI0NTU5NTc=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"pubnative/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pubnative","id":7806659,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc4MDY2NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7806659?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pubnative","html_url":"https://github.com/pubnative","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pubnative/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pubnative/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pubnative/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pubnative/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pubnative/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pubnative/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pubnative/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pubnative/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pubnative/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pubnative/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3700\r\n\r\nAccordingly to https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18074, the Requests package through 2.19.1 before 2018-09-14 for Python sends an HTTP Authorization header to an http URI upon receiving a same-hostname https-to-http redirect, which makes it easier for remote attackers to discover credentials by sniffing the network.\r\n\r\nIt's recommended to have `requests>=2.20.0`.\r\n\r\n**This will not break anything given what we had was  `['requests>=2.5.1, <3']`. If it's a new installation, it will install the latest version. This change is mainly for users who already have `requests<=2.19.1` installed. We should force them to upgrade.**","created_at":"2019-01-14T01:43:12Z","updated_at":"2019-01-14T10:10:49Z","closed_at":"2019-01-14T10:10:05Z","merged_at":"2019-01-14T10:10:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"1347ccf8271b00c4b47d3df3b28019c9e083953b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4517/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4517/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4517/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/87531773e44f2454542536aab5e0f36460f0c7af","head":{"label":"XD-DENG:patch-2","ref":"patch-2","sha":"87531773e44f2454542536aab5e0f36460f0c7af","user":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":142260154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDIyNjAxNTQ=","name":"airflow","full_name":"XD-DENG/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3695\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFollowing the [dev mailing list about AIP-6](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/90c3f38fbda49eca772b32cb55a6274ff2c536e6ecdcaf706ea87826@%3Cdev.airflow.apache.org%3E), I replaced Flake8 by Pylint. I choose Pylint because it's a widely used tool, very configurable and is already used here and there [in Airflow itself](https://github.com/apache/airflow/search?q=pylint&unscoped_q=pylint).\r\n\r\nOn top of the default Pylint configuration (see .pylintrc), I set some sensible defaults:\r\n```\r\ndisable=comprehension-escape,\r\n        pointless-statement,\r\n        invalid-name,\r\n        duplicate-code,\r\n        abstract-method,\r\n        bad-continuation\r\n\r\nignored-argument-names=_.*|^ignored_|^unused_|args|kwargs (added args & kwargs)\r\n\r\nmax-args=15\r\n\r\nmin-public-methods=1\r\n```\r\n\r\nPylint is much stricter than Flake8 and I'm sure it will lead to some discussion about the configuration in the beginning. However I'm convinced in the long run it will lead to much more consistent code. This PR adds and applies Pylint only on changed lines compared to master with the help of [diff-cover](https://github.com/Bachmann1234/diff-cover). I see it as an intermediate solution, until the entire Airflow codebase is Pylint-compliant and we can simply run Pylint on complete changed files.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new

from the database. However, microsecond is stored in the task_instance table. So all task instances of manually-triggered DAG Runs can not be queried successfully inside the set_state function.\r\n\r\nThe result is: for all the manually-triggered DAG Runs, if users try to mark state of a task instance, it will fail because no corresponding records can be found. \r\n\r\nThis doesn't impact any scheduled DAG Runs since the microsecond in their execution_date is 0.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-13T07:21:05Z","updated_at":"2019-01-13T14:39:12Z","closed_at":"2019-01-13T14:33:08Z","merged_at":"2019-01-13T14:33:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"0d386e29d87ce1f8c8528c16a7cf4cbc15d70b43","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4504/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4504/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4504/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/7af58f147bd18f354dae87a6ca6f0a0d76746a4e","head":{"label":"XD-DENG:fix_mark_state_for_manual_triggered_dag_runs","ref":"fix_mark_state_for_manual_triggered_dag_runs","sha":"7af58f147bd18f354dae87a6ca6f0a0d76746a4e","user":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":142260154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDIyNjAxNTQ=","name":"airflow","full_name":"XD-DENG/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3681\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe service account/connection to GCP can have an optional default\r\nproject id assigned. The project id can be specified explicitly\r\nif we wish to override it, but when not specified (i.e. set to None)\r\nthe default one should be used instead.\r\n\r\nThis solution uses centralised decorator in order to have a common\r\nplace where retrieval logic is implemented for all operators.\r\nProject_id is an important parameter of all GCP calls, therefore\r\nin hooks it is left as always first positional parameter and it\r\nhas no default value. This has the added value that you have to\r\nexplicitly provide a value = None if you want to use default\r\nproject id.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand in operators, project_id is optional as in this\r\ncase you usually want to operate on default connection and project.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit test cases:\r\n\r\n* BigtableInstanceCreateTest.test_create_instance_that_exists_empty_project_id\r\n* BigtableInstanceCreateTest.test_updating_cluster_but_instance_does_not_exists_empty_project_id\r\n* BigtableInstanceCreateTest.test_updating_cluster_that_does_not_exists_empty_project_id\r\n* BigtableInstanceDeleteTest.test_delete_execute_empty_project_id\r\n* BigtableInstanceDeleteTest.test_deleting_instance_that_doesnt_exists_empty_project_id\r\n* BigtableTableDeleteTest.test_deleting_table_that_doesnt_exists_empty_project_id\r\n* BigtableTableCreateTest.test_creating_table_that_exists_empty_project_id\r\n* GceInstanceStartTest.test_start_should_not_throw_ex_when_project_id_None\r\n* GceInstanceStopTest.test_stop_should_not_throw_ex_when_project_id_none\r\n* GceInstanceSetMachineTypeTest.test_set_machine_type_should_not_throw_ex_when_project_id_none\r\n* GceInstanceGroupManagerUpdateTest.test_successful_instance_group_update_missing_project_id\r\n* GceInstanceTemplateCopyTest.test_successful_copy_template_missing_project_id\r\n* GcfFunctionDeployTest.test_empty_project_id_is_ok\r\n* CloudSpannerTest.test_instance_create_missing_project_id\r\n* CloudSpannerTest.test_instance_update_missing_project_id\r\n* CloudSpannerTest.test_instance_query_missing_project_id\r\n* CloudSpannerTest.test_database_update_missing_project_id\r\n* CloudSpannerTest.test_database_delete_missing_project_id\r\n* CloudSqlQueryValidationTest.test_create_operator_with_correct_parameters_project_id_missing\r\n* CloudSqlTest.test_instance_create_missing_project_id\r\n* CloudSqlTest.test_instance_patch_missing_project_id\r\n* CloudSqlTest.test_instance_delete_missing_project_id\r\n* CloudSqlTest.test_instance_db_create_missing_project_id\r\n* CloudSqlTest.test_instance_db_patch_missing_project_id\r\n* CloudSqlTest.test_instance_db_delete_missing_project_id\r\n* CloudSqlTest.test_instance_export_missing_project_id\r\n* CloudSqlTest.test_instance_import_missing_project_id\r\n\r\nSystem tests updated with cases with project_id not set:\r\n* example_gcp_sql_query.py\r\n* example_gcp_spanner.sql\r\n* example_gcp_sql.py\r\n* example_gcp_spanner.py\r\n* example_gcp_compute_igm.py\r\n* example_gcp_compute.py\r\n* example_gcp_bigtable_operators.py\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\nDocumentation is updated.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-722\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe pr is based on https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1964 which get stale recently. It is very useful to have a sensor check whether the celery queue is empty or not.\r\n\r\nI add unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title:\r\n  -https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3284\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with [AIRFLOW-3284], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nAdds an operator to create an Azure Batch AI cluster. There is a hook, example DAG, and tests to support this operator. Azure Batch AI allows users to experiment and train deep learning and AI models in parallel at scale.\r\nOperator supports creating a batch AI cluster by using any Marketplace image when given the publisher, offer, sku, and version.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThere are unit tests that test a successful execution of the operator and an execution that raises an Airflow exception.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-12T00:28:30Z","updated_at":"2019-11-27T17:48:21Z","closed_at":"2019-11-27T17:48:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"936143c7d820c38482665021175eb74c0b42e976","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3680\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis commit performs consistency change for tests for all GCP-related operators.\r\nThe operators were evolving over time and the approach to implement those\r\nhave changed over time. After some 30+ operators implemented, it's time\r\nto introduce some consistency across all the operators. Those are:\r\n\r\n* Separating out System test cases from Unit test cases\r\n* Consistent names of variables that are used in system test cases\r\n* Updated documentation to be consistent across the operators\r\n* Updated examples to be better readable and runnable as System Tests\r\n* Added helper methods that allow to make setUp/tearDown for System Tests\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR does not add new tests, but it reorganises existing tests for all GCP-related operators. Mostly it splits System Tests from Unit Tests and creates helper classes that allow to run System Tests for GCP more easily.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] Documentation is updated for involved classes (mainly gcp_function* operators for which examples were merged from two files into one).\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-11T23:49:34Z","updated_at":"2019-01-15T08:08:42Z","closed_at":"2019-01-12T12:44:02Z","merged_at":"2019-01-12T12:44:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"238b725e2cf73e2cca477c8993fccb8047d850e7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4493/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4493/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4493/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/5ac496aa7e77b4de0d9f9de7dbc90d4568f60b4c","head":{"label":"PolideaInternal:AIRFLOW-3680-consistency-update-for-tests-GCP","ref":"AIRFLOW-3680-consistency-update-for-tests-GCP","sha":"5ac496aa7e77b4de0d9f9de7dbc90d4568f60b4c","user":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147329695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDczMjk2OTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"PolideaInternal/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow","description":"Apache

It might sounds pretty\r\nnon-obvious to need a write permission when you import\r\ndata from GCP bucket, but this is required.\r\n\r\nIt's not well documented but you can find it in description here:\r\n\r\nhttps://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/import-export/importing#csv-reqs\r\n\r\n(Click on the GCLOUD (2ND GEN)) and you will see that you need it:\r\n\r\nAdd the service account to the bucket ACL as a writer:\r\n\r\ngsutil acl ch -u [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS]:W gs://[BUCKET_NAME]\r\nAdd the service account to the import file as a reader:\r\n\r\ngsutil acl ch -u [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS]:R gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/[IMPORT_FILE_NAME]\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis is just an example/documentation change\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\nNo new

commit performs consistency change for tests for all GCP-related operators.\r\nThe operators were evolving over time and the approach to implement those\r\nhave changed over time. After some 30+ operators implemented, it's time\r\nto introduce some consistency across all the operators. Those are:\r\n\r\n* Separating out System test cases from Unit test cases\r\n* Consistent names of variables that are used in system test cases\r\n* Updated documentation to be consistent across the operators\r\n* Updated examples to be better readable and runnable as System Tests\r\n* Added helper methods that allow to make setUp/tearDown for System Tests\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3647\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nTo enable to spark behavior of transporting and extracting an archive\r\non job launch,  making the _contents_ of the archive available to the\r\ndriver as well as the workers (not just the jar or archive as a zip\r\nfile) - this configuration attribute is necessary.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nMy PR adjusted existing tests to include the new attribute.  If the original test was considered sufficient, I hope this addendum does as well.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-3650\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3650\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-3650\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\ntest_trigger_dag_button seems to be failing pretty consistent for MySQL ORM. \r\n\r\nI think the issue is not on the actual test, but on mysqlclient. The session can't get the latest data from  from ORM after finish running this line(https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/tests/www_rbac/test_views.py#L1473). But I try different mysqlclient version which doesn't work. To unblock, I would suggest we skip MySQL orm for this test.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-08T03:15:29Z","updated_at":"2019-01-08T08:23:46Z","closed_at":"2019-01-08T08:23:32Z","merged_at":"2019-01-08T08:23:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"8a45a3fdd0df1159d3d630273aba75d964780e4f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4457/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4457/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4457/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/379493c844b0fc11dff2e2b2502fb50703d9f481","head":{"label":"feng-tao:tfeng_fix_test","ref":"tfeng_fix_test","sha":"379493c844b0fc11dff2e2b2502fb50703d9f481","user":{"login":"feng-tao","id":3223098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao","html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":122814628,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjI4MTQ2Mjg=","name":"airflow","full_name":"feng-tao/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"feng-tao","id":3223098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao","html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao/airflow","description":"Apache

title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3630\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen there is an error during Cloud SQL Query, there was a cleanup in post_execute_method. This cleanup is supposed to delete the connection, however it turns out that post_execute is not executed when execute() method throws an error (it was bad assumption). \r\n\r\nThe connection is now closed in finally clause in execute.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n   - CloudSqlQueryValidationTest.test_cloudsql_hook_delete_connection_on_exception \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  No documentation

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3281\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently the implementation of git-sync is broken because:\r\n\r\n* git-sync clones the repository in /tmp and not in airflow-dags volume\r\n* git-sync add a link to point to the revision required but it is not\r\ntaken into account in AIRFLOW__CORE__DAGS_FOLDER\r\n\r\nDags/logs hostPath volume has been added (needed if airflow run in\r\nkubernetes in local environment)\r\n\r\nIn this PR I also removed worker_dags_folder config because IMO is redundant. In fact is possible to define it in dags_folder using a specific airflow-configmap for the workers\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nTo avoid false positive in CI load_examples is set to False\r\notherwise DAGs from airflow/example_dags are always loaded. In this\r\nway is possible to test import in DAGs.\r\n\r\nTo do so KubernetesExecutorTest now uses a specific folder airflowexample_dags_kubernetes to run test instead of airflow/example_dags and the DAG example_kubernetes_annotation imports a an external module\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-05T21:56:21Z","updated_at":"2019-01-09T17:32:28Z","closed_at":"2019-01-07T20:31:56Z","merged_at":"2019-01-07T20:31:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"e6c16734e169bb352e029b7cee91ba9b745123a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4444/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4444/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4444/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/e6c16734e169bb352e029b7cee91ba9b745123a2","head":{"label":"dimberman:1-10-with-git-sync","ref":"1-10-with-git-sync","sha":"e6c16734e169bb352e029b7cee91ba9b745123a2","user":{"login":"dimberman","id":2644098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman","html_url":"https://github.com/dimberman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104245736,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQyNDU3MzY=","name":"airflow","full_name":"dimberman/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dimberman","id":2644098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman","html_url":"https://github.com/dimberman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dimberman/airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3476\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3477\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nMove the KubeResourceVersion and KubeWorkerIdentifier classes to a separate file as part of the big models.py refactor (/airflow/models/kubernetes.py). I thought it'd sensible to move the two K8S models into a single file since they're related. Hence, this PR references AIRFLOW-3476 and AIRFLOW-3477.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-05T21:42:44Z","updated_at":"2019-02-06T08:55:16Z","closed_at":"2019-02-06T08:55:16Z","merged_at":"2019-02-06T08:55:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"e1d3df19992c76aff47fa18b9afca8ebf691e1da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4443/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4443/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4443/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/8e963c219e6a07c79e682706d4ffc6a538bf1bf0","head":{"label":"BasPH:bash-move-models-k8s","ref":"bash-move-models-k8s","sha":"8e963c219e6a07c79e682706d4ffc6a538bf1bf0","user":{"login":"BasPH","id":6249654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDk2NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6249654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH","html_url":"https://github.com/BasPH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"0f02e45b7e127da3539752607ab02347d9fcd733","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

zipped Dag trigger for Web and Api\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3626\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- Conversion from Dagbag() to Dagbag(fileloc_of_zip) fails.\r\n- This happened with the following commits for [api](https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/aa17b5baf886f7e23b3a9bcf8fef45759193f1b6) and for [webserver](https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/548f38a81e096ea25de09131affdc66d392b1ece)\r\n- The above commits are necessary to speed up trigger of dag else it will parse all dags again.\r\n- Hence added utility function similar to open_maybe_zipped to handle cases where fileloc can be a zipped python file. e.g. ~/airflow/dags/example.zip/example.py\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`","created_at":"2019-01-05T07:20:41Z","updated_at":"2019-04-29T10:39:10Z","closed_at":"2019-04-29T10:39:10Z","merged_at":"2019-04-29T10:39:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"e518a1e5050151af70abfef529b8a54521df8924","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4439/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4439/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4439/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/107eee09134743217960eb0d214db8615eda6cdd","head":{"label":"shubhparekh:master","ref":"master","sha":"107eee09134743217960eb0d214db8615eda6cdd","user":{"login":"shubhparekh","id":9915960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5MTU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9915960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhparekh","html_url":"https://github.com/shubhparekh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhparekh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhparekh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhparekh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhparekh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhparekh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhparekh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhparekh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhparekh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhparekh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":164180423,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjQxODA0MjM=","name":"airflow","full_name":"shubhparekh/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shubhparekh","id":9915960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5MTU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9915960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhparekh","html_url":"https://github.com/shubhparekh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhparekh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhparekh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhparekh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhparekh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhparekh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhparekh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhparekh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhparekh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhparekh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shubhparekh/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3628\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn airflow alert email, the value of the from field is the source email address, but sometimes we want to show the receiver where the alert is really from. For example, the email was sent from no-reply@example.com, but we want to show the receiver it was from \"airflow\", so that it is easy to distinguish it from other messages. With this PR, we just need to set \"smtp_mime_from = \"airflow\" in airflow.cfg.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-04T08:04:15Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T16:26:50Z","closed_at":"2019-09-11T16:26:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d8ca62a0dec8ba559317b1efbd723e46278e99ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

Jira\r\n\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3627\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n`/task_stats` is used quite frequently. Every time the main page is loaded, it will be called. But actually the performance of it can be improved significantly by minor changes.\r\n\r\n1. In the sqlalchemy `.filter()` statement, no need to explicitly add `==True`. The value itself is already Boolean. Doing another explicit comparison is adding heavy overhead. This change helps improve query performance significantly\r\n\r\n2. We can merge the multiple `.filter()`s (https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/query.html#sqlalchemy.orm.query.Query.filter).\r\n\r\n**After these changes, the query time can be reduced by ~20%** (_the absolute value of the time reduced is not big, given the query itself is quite simple_).\r\n\r\n#### Benchmarking\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow.settings import Session\r\nfrom airflow import

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nRef to document https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/machine-types\r\n\r\n> When the scale_tier is set to CUSTOM, user should specify masterType\r\n> The CUSTOM tier is not a set tier, but rather enables you to use your own cluster specification. When you use this tier, set values to configure your processing cluster according to these guidelines:\r\n> \r\n> * You must set TrainingInput.masterType to specify the type of machine to use for your master node. This is the only required setting. See the machine types described below.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes
