while.","created_at":"2017-09-08T15:30:24Z","updated_at":"2017-09-09T05:55:27Z","closed_at":"2017-09-09T05:55:24Z","merged_at":"2017-09-09T05:55:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"f895b832db6f9658f05edc084d6afa55dfaf34ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/1728/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/1728/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1728/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/statuses/1633a60d26195be1a2884314f85bafe563711ff2","head":{"label":"openzipkin:encode-v1","ref":"encode-v1","sha":"1633a60d26195be1a2884314f85bafe563711ff2","user":{"login":"openzipkin","id":11860887,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExODYwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11860887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4576305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTc2MzA1","name":"zipkin","full_name":"openzipkin/zipkin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"openzipkin","id":11860887,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExODYwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11860887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin","description":"Zipkin

represents the minimal read apis needed for Zipkin\r\n\r\nAs discussed earlier on gitter w/ @basvanbeek, we no longer do\r\nadjustment at storage layer. Essentially, all operations are \"raw\",\r\nwhich reduces the responsibility of implementors. This also midly\r\nchanges the `getTrace` call, disallowing it from returning null (as\r\nempty will suffice).\r\n\r\nThis adds SpanStore which returns Call objects as opposed to replicating\r\nsignatures for synchronous and asynchronous invocations. Unlike before,\r\nthis does not support \"adjustments\" rather assumes they happen at a\r\nlayer above storage. This decision refines the storage query api to the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nCall<List<List<Span>>> getTraces(QueryRequest request);\r\n\r\nCall<List<Span>> getTrace(long traceIdHigh, long traceIdLow);\r\n\r\nCall<List<String>> getServiceNames();\r\n\r\nCall<List<String>> getSpanNames(String serviceName);\r\n\r\nCall<List<DependencyLink>> getDependencies(long endTs, long lookback);\r\n```\r\n\r\nA later change might replace the getTrace call with a hex string \r\nparameter.\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-27T08:49:18Z","updated_at":"2017-08-30T01:38:03Z","closed_at":"2017-08-30T00:49:38Z","merged_at":"2017-08-30T00:49:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"53726596685f6f1de8059e79d1927b3282cff5cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/1709/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/1709/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1709/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/statuses/5b88715442d29b10573f094730555ec25f33e0d2","head":{"label":"openzipkin:spanstore2","ref":"spanstore2","sha":"5b88715442d29b10573f094730555ec25f33e0d2","user":{"login":"openzipkin","id":11860887,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExODYwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11860887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4576305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTc2MzA1","name":"zipkin","full_name":"openzipkin/zipkin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"openzipkin","id":11860887,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExODYwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11860887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin","description":"Zipkin

Zipkin v1, we had a pair of SPI interfaces: `SpanConsumer`\r\nand `AsyncSpanConsumer`.\r\n\r\nFor example, this would define the same thing twice:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nvoid SpanConsumer.accept(List<Span> spans);\r\n\r\n// and\r\n\r\nvoid AsyncSpanConsumer.accept(List<Span> spans, Callback<Void> spans);\r\n```\r\n\r\nin v2, it looks like this (inspired by Retrofit and OkHttp's call):\r\n\r\n```java\r\nCall<Void> accept(List<Span> spans);\r\n\r\n// then make a call like this..\r\ncall = spanConsumer.accept(spans);\r\n\r\n// to do a blocking call..\r\ncall.execute();\r\n\r\n// to do an async call..\r\ncall.enqueue(callback);\r\n\r\n// to cancel\r\ncall.cancel();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe important part of this design is that it reduces the redundant\r\ninterfaces. We end up making less work for users and implementors\r\nat the cost of an intermediary type: Call.\r\n\r\nThis design is near identical to [Retrofit's Call](https://github.com/square/retrofit/blob/master/retrofit/src/main/java/retrofit2/Call.java), which is itself similar to\r\n[OkHttp's call](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp/src/main/java/okhttp3/Call.java). The mild difference here is that the underlying remote\r\nwork may not always be http even if the first impl (elasticsearch)\r\nhappens to be.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to @JakeWharton and @swankjesse for the prior

format\r\n\r\nThis indexing model will be available in the next minor release of\r\nZipkin, particularly for Elasticsearch 2.4+. If you aren't running\r\nElasticsearch 2.4+, yet. Please upgrade.\r\n\r\nThose wishing to experiment with this format before the next minor\r\nrelease can set `ES_EXPERIMENTAL_SPAN2=true` to use this style now.\r\nWhen set, writes will use the above scheme, but both the former and new\r\nindexes will be read.\r\n    \r\nFixes #1676\r\nSee #1644 for the new span2 model\r\nSee #1679 for the dual-read approach, which this is similar to\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis uses the span2 model from #1499 to implement Elasticsearch without using nested queries. This works with Elasticsearch 2.4+, 5.x and 6.0 alpha2.\r\n  2.4 was released Aug 2016 and works if run with `ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Dmapper.allow_dots_in_name=true`\r\n\r\nThe key changes are the following:\r\n* there's only one type per index, and this is handled by a :type suffix. ex zipkin:span-2017-08-01 and zipkin:dependency-2017-08-01\r\n* this uses the span2 model as yeah it is more effective. currently there is no \"servicespan\" type/index anymore\r\n* the index naming above intentionally dodges existing collectors and indexes. we don't want to write a new type to an old index template\r\n* for this reason, the index templates themselves are also at type-specific locations\r\n\r\nall of the above should support running old and new collectors simultaneously eventhough the current code doesn't yet read the old stuff\r\n\r\ncc @openzipkin/elasticsearch this resumes #1651 which I can't get to
