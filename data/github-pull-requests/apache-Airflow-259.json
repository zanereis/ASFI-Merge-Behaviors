sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5311\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAdds a new `AWSLambdaOperator` that submits JSON payloads to AWS Lambda functions. Users pass a function to the constructor to inspect and validate the response (unless using API Gateway there's no guarantee that an HTTP 200 response from Lambda actually means your Lambda job succeeded).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n`tests/contrib/operators/aws_lambda_operator.py` has been added to test the `AWSLambdaOperator#execute` method\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-26T09:29:45Z","updated_at":"2020-01-26T22:39:21Z","closed_at":"2020-01-26T22:39:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"11a75ff4777c3ad322ba37a5aaf5c5dd1748ed25","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5307\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe BaseOperator currently resides in /airflow/models but has never been a database model, i.e. it is not stored in a database table. I suggest to move it to its logical place, the operators package.\r\n\r\nTo preserve backwards compatibility I import the BaseOperator in /airflow/models/\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py and raise a DeprecationWarning when imported from there. All references to airflow.models.BaseOperator have been removed and I suggest to remove backward compatibility in Airflow 2.0.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo test logic altered, only moved package names.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-25T07:44:17Z","updated_at":"2021-02-05T18:48:36Z","closed_at":"2021-02-05T18:48:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4176cb59dbc10711023f1363e1d167fbefa20bc4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1536638852,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTM2NjM4ODUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/pinned","name":"pinned","color":"f2b798","default":false,"description":"Protect

Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nOriginal reason stated in the PR why zombie detection was moved \r\n```Zombie tasks will be calculate by DAG parsing manager and send to DAG parsing processor to kill. This is to reduce DB CPU load( identified to produce 80% of CPU load during stress test, CPU usage went down from 80%+ to ~40% after this change).``` \r\nfrom https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3873.\r\n\r\nI see no point sending a query joining two biggest tables in every DAG parsing. Establishing new connections is much more expensive than sending an aggregated query. It doesn't seem to deliver any immediate value: the DB load in a smaller cluster was not changing. And if we want to compare the running time diff we compare the aggregated query running time on all DAG file processors vs. the old query running time instead of compare the individual query. We parse a couple thoudsand files in 2 mins and it will generate heavy load to the DB, which I believe is the biggest bottelneck of Airflow scalibility.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nReverting PR\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-24T17:18:20Z","updated_at":"2019-10-16T14:32:54Z","closed_at":"2019-10-14T22:16:00Z","merged_at":"2019-10-14T22:16:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"cb0dbe309b518813529ddf7545ae942e5767f5e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"feng-tao","id":3223098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao","html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"BasPH","id":6249654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDk2NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6249654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH","html_url":"https://github.com/BasPH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5908/commits","review_comments_url":"https://a

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5303\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5306\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn PR https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5906 I wanted to create a link that contains the \"#\" character, but it was not set correctly in the web interface.\r\n\r\n\r\nCC: @milton0825 \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAWS Batch supports [passing parameters to jobs](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/batch.html#Batch.Client.submit_job), and this update enables that functionality in the `AWSBatchOperator`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n`tests/contrib/operators/test_awsbatch_operator.py` has been updated to include `parameters`.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-23T15:57:42Z","updated_at":"2019-11-22T15:33:51Z","closed_at":"2019-11-22T15:33:50Z","merged_at":"2019-11-22T15:33:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"01a15b82bdc2ec6782c2fc42036f730a4734662d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5194) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5194\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAdded try/except with logging.warning on action log error, quite less scary than having a wall of red text pop up from the unhandled error.\r\n\r\nAlso removed action logging from the CLI version command which doesn't do\r\nanything worth logging.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: no functional changes.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

indefinitely\r\n* Catches the errors in the scheduler, and retries scheduling the task, in a similar fashion to how ApiExcptions are caught. (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/46885ccdbc8618f295b8f986da95c1abbb85bb02/airflow/executors/kubernetes_executor.py#L800-L803)\r\n* Fixes a bug in the parsing of airflow.cfg. The notes state that a json dict is expected. This is parsed with `json.loads`, which returns a dict. But in the code, .iteritems() is called on this dict, which cannot work. .items() should be used instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces an `assert` statement that exists in the SkipMixin class with raising a `ValueError` instead. The rationale for this is that assert statements should generally be reserved for testing and shouldn't exist in production logic, because they can be ignored in certain cases (specifically with the [`PYTHONOPTIMIZE` environment variable or `-O` CLI flag](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-o).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTests already exist for this functionality.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-20T20:34:38Z","updated_at":"2019-08-21T13:25:59Z","closed_at":"2019-08-21T12:17:50Z","merged_at":"2019-08-21T12:17:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"aa8a30099884efbf6fd5fb276f3dc6a310866aba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5875/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5875/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5875/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/7530d928e0611711e292313e9d68a22950c4d472","head":{"label":"AetherUnbound:bugfix/skip-remove-assert","ref":"bugfix/skip-remove-assert","sha":"7530d928e0611711e292313e9d68a22950c4d472","user":{"login":"AetherUnbound","id":10214785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjE0Nzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10214785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AetherUnbound","html_url":"https://github.com/AetherUnbound","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AetherUnbound/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AetherUnbound/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AetherUnbound/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AetherUnbound/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AetherUnbound/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AetherUnbound/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AetherUnbound/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AetherUnbound/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AetherUnbound/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":196427449,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY0Mjc0NDk=","name":"airflow","full_name":"AetherUnbound/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AetherUnbound","id":10214785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjE0Nzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10214785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AetherUnbound","html_url":"https://github.com/AetherUnbound","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AetherUnbound/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AetherUnbound/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AetherUnbound/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AetherUnbound/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AetherUnbound/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AetherUnbound/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AetherUnbound/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AetherUnbound/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AetherUnbound/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AetherUnbound/airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5268\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe Airflow codebase is extremely confusing because the concept \"root\" node in Airflow is actually implemented as the last, finishing node of a DAG, while in DAG literature root nodes are the first nodes to execute. Or, as literature also explains it: root nodes are nodes without upstream dependencies, while it was implemented as nodes without downstream dependencies.\r\n\r\nThis PR aligns the Airflow implementation of a \"root\" node with DAG literature. I've also implemented a `leaves` property to make a clear distinction between first/starting nodes and last/finishing nodes. Also, to my surprise there weren't even tests for these basic properties, so I added 3 tests verifying the behaviour of `roots` and `leaves`.\r\n\r\nThe implementation involved:\r\n- Correctly implementing the definition root and leaf nodes\r\n- Adding tests verifying this behaviour\r\n- Some switching between upstream/downstream calls here and there because of the now correct behaviour\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAdded 3 tests, see above.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1.

is (initially experimental) change that introduces ESLiniting and npm audit as pre-commit hooks. Introduction of those two required fixing all current ESLint errors and upgrading NPM dependencies to latest versions (there were more than 50 vulnerabilities reported via npm audit with the current master version of the JS libraries).\r\n\r\nIt was initially experimental, because I was not sure whether this will be successful. I upgraded to latest version of dependencies using npm audit and then upgraded to latest version of eslint and finally run `eslint --fix`. Surprisingly there were just a few errors left that were easy to fix manually. Also when I run the webserver - going through pretty much all the screens I did not see any errors.\r\n\r\nOf course it requires quite a bit more testing but I think if we make a small group effort to test it, we might get rid of all the ESLint problems and thanks to pre-commit hooks also keep it like that in the future. \r\n\r\nI am aware of Closed  #3656 and the idea from @mik-laj about separating out the HTML code to .js - and finally https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2803 which I created subtask of. However I think if we merge this one - this will be great step forward with the .js code improvement. Having eslint + npm audit in place is already great - especially from security point of view.\r\n\r\nNote - I added npm audit as separate pre-commit hook, in the way that if someone changes any .js code, it will be run locally (and potentially point out to some upgrades that should be performed) but I skipped it in regular CI builds so that audit problems will not block us from merging unrelated changes. I run it however in the daily CRON build - so that we can get an early warning that some NPM dependency requires  upgrade due to security vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.

change should speed-up incremental builds in case of setup.py changes. Previously setup.py changed caused npm ci to be triggered but there are several reasons why this is not needed:\r\n\r\n* setup.py changes far more frequently than package.json and package-npm.json. In most cases when setup.py changes, the npm packages do not need to be updated\r\n* npm packages do not depend on pip packages installed\r\n* there is pre-installation of pip packages implemented now - so when we hit the npm ci in the new version, we already have master dependencies installed from pip. Therefore even if package-lock.json changes, the pip packages are already pre-installed and at most we just install the changed ones.\r\n\r\nThat should speed up the build (when setup.py changes) by about a minute.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x  ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes: Remove unused, unneeded import in kubernetes.rst\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ x ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: One line docs change :) \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1523\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nCurrently, in the dag view, execution_date is not included as query param for the Graph or Gantt Chart views. It also is not included as part of the Back To {{ parentdag }} link.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1498\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe want to collect anonymous user event data from our Airflow deployments, without having to maintain a fork or plugin. This PR adds an easy method for Airflow users to send anonymous user event data to several popular destinations: Google Analytics, Segment, and Metarouter.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nDidn't any relevant tests to change, but I could be missing something as I'm new to contributing to Airflow. Happy to write some tests, if it is warranted.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-18T02:35:51Z","updated_at":"2019-08-22T23:16:53Z","closed_at":"2019-08-22T11:32:48Z","merged_at":"2019-08-22T11:32:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"28e3802c328706d2332b9634240d8f090d7a6854","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5850/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5850/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5850/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/11a0924042c4bf8fe7d79050df7a554cdc721696","head":{"label":"astronomer:AIRFLOW-1498","ref":"AIRFLOW-1498","sha":"11a0924042c4bf8fe7d79050df7a554cdc721696","user":{"login":"astronomer","id":12449437,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNDQ5NDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12449437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer","html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65323404,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTMyMzQwNA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"astronomer/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"astronomer","id":12449437,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNDQ5NDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12449437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer","html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5241\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nI believe there are many ways to improve the current test suite. To start, I suggest to make the test class naming consistent by always starting with \"Test\".\r\n\r\nSome insights:\r\n- There are 557 test classes (`grep -r \"class\" . | grep \"TestCase\" | wc -l`)\r\n- 240 of those start with \"Test\"\r\n- 277 of those end with \"Test\"\r\n- Leaving 40 classes with some other name, e.g. CliTests, PluginsTestRBAC and DagGcpSystemTestCase\r\n\r\nThere is no convention AFAIK in unittest for test classes (only tests themselves -> start with \"test\"). I suggest to make all test classes start with \"Test\" because I know there is some work being done on moving to Pytest, which discovers test classes starting with \"Test\" ([link](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/goodpractices.html#conventions-for-python-test-discovery)).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis PR involved renaming all non Test* named test classes.\r\n\r\nI had to make one other change in tests/utils/test_helpers.py which contained two classes TestHelpers and HelpersTest, both testing exactly the same things, even with identical test names. I merged the two classes and merged the tests with identical names.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/AIRFLOW-5158) feature request to create a hook for interacting with Google sheets. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] This PR includes the hook code and test. The hook covers the [values](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/values) portion of the Google Sheets API (get, update, append, clear). This hook will allow for operators, for example SheetToDatabase and DatabaseToSheet etc. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests : tests/contrib/hooks/test_gcp_sheets_hook.py\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] (N.A.) In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-16T22:37:52Z","updated_at":"2019-08-27T14:21:52Z","closed_at":"2019-08-27T07:17:07Z","merged_at":"2019-08-27T07:17:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"df3397cd6c66b260e20288bf4d1ca075213485f0","assignee":{"login":"milton0825","id":6065051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjUwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6065051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825","html_url":"https://github.com/milton0825","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"milton0825","id":6065051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjUwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6065051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825","html_url":"https://github.com/milton0825","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5845/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5845/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5845/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/cee55ddb228fa38e17fd9c663efb0b05617d87dc","head":{"label":"hagope:google-sheets-hook","ref":"google-sheets-hook","sha":"cee55ddb228fa38e17fd9c663efb0b05617d87dc","user":{"login":"hagope","id":65898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagope","html_url":"https://github.com/hagope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"46885ccdbc8618f295b8f986da95c1abbb85bb02","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","foll

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3705) issue and references it in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3705\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nUpdate the `get_conn` method of `PostgresHook` to ensure that the `conn_name_attr` specified is used to establish the connection via `psycopg2`.\r\n\r\nThis is an issue when subclassing `PostgresHook`. The `postgres_conn_id` attribute must be overridden since it is explicitly used in establishing the connection. Now any given `conn_name_attr` set when subclassing will be used when connecting.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  - Adds a small subclass of `PostgresHook` with a new `conn_name_attr` which is used in `TestPostgresHookConn`. This illustrates the problem with the default behavior for `get_conn` with three test failures that say:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nAttributeError: 'UnitTestPostgresHook' object has no attribute 'postgres_conn_id'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-16T20:17:51Z","updated_at":"2019-12-06T19:19:28Z","closed_at":"2019-08-28T12:23:11Z","merged_at":"2019-08-28T12:23:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"f823a66001c9f3682153acbf27bca137d0f4a7ec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5841/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5841/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5841/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/d75880c4c9c3d5e1ef938d064ed74dbe66da21e3","head":{"label":"coopergillan:AIRFLOW-3705-bug-fix-PostgresHook-get_conn","ref":"AIRFLOW-3705-bug-fix-PostgresHook-get_conn","sha":"d75880c4c9c3d5e1ef938d064ed74dbe66da21e3","user":{"login":"coopergillan","id":10765706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzY1NzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10765706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopergillan","html_url":"https://github.com/coopergillan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopergillan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopergillan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopergillan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopergillan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopergillan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopergillan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopergillan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopergillan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopergillan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":167388106,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjczODgxMDY=","name":"airflow","full_name":"coopergillan/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"coopergillan","id":10765706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzY1NzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10765706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopergillan","html_url":"https://github.com/coopergillan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopergillan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopergillan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopergillan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopergillan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopergillan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopergillan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopergillan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopergillan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coopergillan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/coopergillan/airflow","description":"Apache

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

The \"nodes\" are deployed inside the main `airflow-testing` container, so I needed to also install docker, hence, this particular implementation relies on docker-in-docker.\r\n\r\nThere's more information in this thread (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/706) around the options that were evaluated to use `kind`.\r\n\r\nFor completeness sake, I considered mounting the host's `/var/run/docker.sock` socket so that we could rely on the host's Docker daemon instead of running docker-in-docker, but I felt docker-in-docker, being a more self-contained implementation, offers the least amount of friction when using it locally for development purposes.  \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't add tests, but it renamed a few integration tests. The Kubernetes ones to be more specific.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5230\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFollowing https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4835, I've also refactored the template file loading functionality to:\r\n\r\n- Avoid building multiple Jinja environments\r\n- Avoid code duplication around `env.loader.get_source`\r\n- Rename `resolve_template_files` to `load_template_files` which follows the Jinja naming\r\n- Support other collection types for storing template file paths (tuple, namedtuple, dict and set)\r\n- Add tests for all types\r\n- Move related tests from `test_dag.py` and `core.py` to `test_baseoperator.py`\r\n- Adhere to 110 char line length\r\n- Add Pydoc\r\n- Add typing\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nMoved tests from `test_dag.py` and `core.py` to their correct location in `test_baseoperator.py`. Also added few tests in `test_baseoperator.py` to test providing template filepaths in various data structures (dict, list, str, etc...).\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-15T17:37:38Z","updated_at":"2020-01-03T20:01:51Z","closed_at":"2020-01-03T20:01:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"02d00864c78e94c64ba9ea8a8b3a4339fd72ba2a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira]\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5218\r\n  - this PR is the smallest possible change that could help that issue\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n  - a small increase in the backoff factor could avoid excessive polling\r\n  - avoid the AWS API throttle limits for highly concurrent tasks\r\n  - correct polling loop details\r\n  - correct log messages, with more informative status details\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n- AWS batch spin-up time:\r\n  - https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=897734\r\n  - Depends on various scheduling intervals:\r\n    - job scheduling interval\r\n    - compute-environment scaling schedule interval\r\n    - API calls to container registry (and container pulls)\r\n  - bottom line, there are inconsistencies from 10-sec to 10-min spin-ups\r\n\r\nHere are some quotes from that message forum link above (note that the forum comments are dated approx 2017 through to 2019 and improvements are released over time).  AWS batch support says,\r\n> For example, if you submit a hundred jobs to AWS Batch, the Scheduler will transition all of these from SUBMITTED to RUNNABLE or PENDING in about a minute. RUNNABLE jobs should transition to STARTING and RUNNING fairly quickly assuming you have sufficient resources in your compute environment.\r\n\r\nAWS batch support note that improvements are released over time,\r\n> For example, when we launched the service, we would schedule jobs every 1 minute. We now perform these operations every 10 seconds. It is however important to differentiate that this delay is seen only if there are no Submitted jobs in the JobQueue. Batch continues to transition and schedule jobs with no delay until the JobQueue has no Submitted or Runnable jobs. Thus, AWS Batch may take longer to schedule an individual job when Jobs are submitted infrequently. At scale, Batch can schedule jobs far more quickly.\r\n\r\nBut, when 100's of jobs require a scaling solution, the delays can be longer,\r\n> Further, it is important to note that the AWS Batch resource scaling decisions occur on a different frequency. Upon receiving your first job submission, AWS Batch will launch an initial set of compute resources. After this point Batch re-evaluates resource needs approximately every 10 minutes. By making scaling decisions less frequently, we avoid scenarios where AWS Batch would scale up too quickly and complete all RUNNABLE jobs, leaving a large number of unused instances with partially consumed billing hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  - there are tests on the AWS BatchOperator already\r\n  - this PR is an implementation detail in a private method\r\n  - the change does not impact any public API\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines\r\n  - just one commit\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - no new functionality\r\n  - logs are more explicit than before\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes
