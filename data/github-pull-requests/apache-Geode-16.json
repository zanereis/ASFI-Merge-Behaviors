to note when doing SSL testing: testcontainers does not let\r\nyou set the container name (using `container_name` in your compose.yml).\r\nThis ultimately means that reverse IP lookups produce

The problem is that these\r\nnames are not RFC compliant as they contain underscores. This can break\r\nsome aspects of SSL validation.

fix looks the same as the previous fix for GEODE-8977 but it performs much better.\r\nThe expensive form of getThreadInfo (the one that requests lock info) is now called at\r\nmost once each time the thread monitor wakes up. Before it was called at least once for every\r\nthread that was stuck. With a high number of stuck threads this could cause operations like the\r\nmembership heartbeat to timeout resulting in a forced disconnect.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Problem Description\r\n\r\nSometimes we see a member force-disconnected and we see a preceding gap in the regular sequence of heartbeats generated by the member, but we can't explain why there was a gap. The explanation we are searching for is usually CPU saturation. We look for secondary evidence such as gaps in the regular sequence of statistics e.g. StatSampler sampleCount. When we can't find such secondary evidence, we can't, in good conscience, rule out bugs in the heartbeat generation logic itself.\r\n\r\nThe heartbeat generation logic consists mainly of a thread that loops forever. Each time through the loop it sleeps for member-timeout / logical-interval. By default that's 5s / 2 = 2.5s. When it wakes up it sends unreliable UDP unicast messages to the coordinator and the two non-coordinator members to its \"left\" (earlier) in the view. If that heartbeat generation thread oversleeps or doesn't get adequate time slices when it's awake then heartbeats will be delayed. There will be gaps in the regular sequence.\r\n\r\nWhen this ticket is complete, a warning-level message will be logged if the heartbeat generation thread (see GMSHealthMonitor.startHeartbeatThread()) oversleeps by more than the sleep interval (member-timeout / logical-interval), i.e. if it is asleep for more than 2 * (member-timeout / logical-interval), the warning will be logged.\r\n\r\n### Solution Description\r\n\r\nThis was a pretty simple addition to `GMSHealthMonitor.sendPeriodicHeartbeats()` to log a warning if we oversleep in our heartbeat-generation loop.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to make this new logic testable I turned what was an anonymous inner class into a non-anonymous one, `Heart`. Then I parameterized `sendPeriodicHeartbeats()` on a sleeper object, a timer object and a warner object. With the setup already in place in `GMSHealthMonitorJUnitTest` this was sufficient to let me test that method in isolation, and deterministically. \r\n\r\nI vacillated between using `System.currentTimeMillis()` which can move backward (it isn't monotonic) and is a relatively more expensive than nanos, but is the norm in `GMSHealthMonitor`, vs `System.nanoTime()` which never moves backward and is more efficient than millis. I picked nanos here. In the end I broke with tradition in `GMSHealthMonitor` because I wanted monotonicity and while I was at it, efficiency (even though this path isn't performance sensitive). **I wonder if there are situations e.g. virtualization situations, where `nanoTime()` fails to move forward when it should?**\r\n\r\n### Questions for Reviewers\r\n\r\n1. We warn if we oversleep by more than one period. Is that the right criterion?\r\n2. What do you think of injecting functions like this to make the method testable, as opposed to adding more mocking?\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

has a PR https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/6314 to fix this same ticket and his PR is passing all tests.\r\n\r\nBruce's PR adds protection (under `stateLock`) for the `inputBuffer`. This PR takes an alternate approach. It reuses the `ByteBufferSharing` framework we introduced last year to fix GEODE-8652. The GEODE-8652 work applied the framework in the `NioFilter` (and related classes) to protect the input and output buffers in the `NioSslEngine`. This PR applies the same idea at the (lower) `Connection` level, to protect the `Connections` input buffer (input from the network).\r\n\r\nA nice thing about the `ByteBufferSharing` framework is that it takes control of buffer resizing. This let us consolidate the resizing code, eliminating redundancy.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, the class that is now `ByteBufferVendor` implemented the `ByteBufferSharing` interface. That worked and was expedient, but it was dangerously wrong. The main point of `ByteBufferVendor` is to provide an `open()` method for use in a try-with-resources block. The `open()` call acquires a lock. All access to the `ByteBuffer` is supposed to be through the _result_ of `open()`. By _implementing_ the `ByteBufferSharing` interface in `ByteBufferVendor` we were exposing methods e.g. `expandWriteBufferIfNeeded(final int newCapacity)` which would have violated the contract, if they had been called directly on a `ByteBufferVendor`. This PR fixes this by eliminating the inheritance. `ByteBufferVendor` now has a `ByteBufferSharing`—it no longer _is a_ `ByteBufferSharing`.\r\n\r\nReviewers note that Github doesn't seem to be noticing that `ByteBufferSharingImpl` was renamed to `ByteBufferVendor` but the git history is there if you pull the branch down and look at it in e.g. IntelliJ.\r\n\r\nAlso you may want to \"hide whitespace changes\" in Github when reviewing the diffs since I added a number of try-with-resources blocks that would otherwise look more disruptive than they actually are.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"491\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4002/115126084-76f07600-9f81-11eb-80c6-cafbfc40efa0.png\">\r\n\r\n### Outstanding Questions for Reviewers\r\n- [x] now that reference counting (for `ByteBuffer`) is in place should I eliminate the `!hasResidualReaderThread()` check guarding `inputBufferVendor.destruct()` in `Connection.close()`? **update: decided to keep the guard in place**\r\n<img width=\"930\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4002/115150701-6215f000-a01e-11eb-8ea6-0c525e1e6c84.png\">\r\n\r\n- [x] did I get the reallocation in `Connection` right? Do the resizing methods in `expand{Write|Read}BufferIfNeeded()` adequately replace what was there before?\r\n- [x] did I get the sense (read vs write) of `expand{Write|Read}BufferIfNeeded()` correct in each case when replacing the reallocation logic in `Connection`? **update: there is now only one `expand…` call and that is in `processInputBuffer()` and I think it's ok. **\r\n- [x] If the input buffer size could be known at `Connection` construction time, much of the added complexity in the `ByteBufferSharing` framework could be reverted. It wasn't apparent how to know those sizes during construction. I wonder if it might be possible to make a good enough guess so as to avoid significant performance impact in the event I guess wrong.\r\n  - [x] can I know the input buffer size at construction-time? **update: well not in the constructors per se but in `createIoFilter()`. Done.**\r\n  - [x] if I can't know the size exactly in all cases, can I get close enough so as not to impact performance? **update: we know the exact size. See latest commit.**\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

corruption is occurring because another thread was using the same ByteBuffer to\r\nperform a handshake on a new Connection and was still in\r\nSocketChannel.read().  The thread initiating the handshake was\r\ninterrupted by CacheServer.close() and released the buffer prematurely,\r\nallowing another thread to grab the still in-use buffer and serialize\r\na message into it.  The handshake thread's SocketChannel.read()\r\noverwrites some of the content of the buffer before it is transmitted.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to include the input buffer as state that needs to be\r\nprotected by the stateLock and allow the handshake thread to retain\r\nownership of the buffer, releasing it in it's cleanup code.\r\n\r\nI also deleted some very old checks for an IBM JRE that is no longer\r\nrequired and was interfering with efforts to write a unit test.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
