parsing SSH certificates where critical options\n  with values were handled incorrectly. Certificates are now created correctly\n  and parsing accepts correct values as well as the previously generated\n  invalid forms with a warning. In the next release, support for parsing these\n  invalid forms will be removed.\n<p>.. _v41-0-1:</p>\n<p>41.0.1 - 2023-06-01\n</code></pre></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Temporarily allow invalid ECDSA signature algorithm parameters in X.509\ncertificates, which are generated by older versions of Java.</li>\n<li>Allow null bytes in pass phrases when serializing private keys.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _v41-0-0:</p>\n<p>41.0.0 - 2023-05-30</p>\n<pre><code>\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Support for OpenSSL less than 1.1.1d has been\n  removed.  Users on older version of OpenSSL will need to upgrade.\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Support for Python 3.6 has been removed.\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Dropped support for LibreSSL &lt; 3.6.\n* Updated the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) to 1.56.0, from 1.48.0.\n* Updated Windows, macOS, and Linux wheels to be compiled with OpenSSL 3.1.1.\n* Added support for the :class:`~cryptography.x509.OCSPAcceptableResponses`\n  OCSP extension.\n* Added support for the :class:`~cryptography.x509.MSCertificateTemplate`\n  proprietary Microsoft certificate extension.\n* Implemented support for equality checks on all asymmetric public key types.\n* Added support for ``aes256-gcm@openssh.com`` encrypted keys in\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.load_ssh_private_key`.\n* Added support for obtaining X.509 certificate signature algorithm parameters\n  (including PSS) via\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate.signature_algorithm_parameters`.\n* Support signing :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.padding.PSS`\n  X.509 certificates via the new keyword-only argument ``rsa_padding`` on\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateBuilder.sign`.\n* Added support for\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead.ChaCha20Poly1305`\n  on BoringSSL.\n<p>.. _v40-0-2:</p>\n<p>40.0.2 - 2023-04-14\n</code></pre></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

ability to cache the NuGet <code>global-packages</code> folder was added in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/pull/303\">actions/setup-dotnet#303</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/nogic1008\"><code>@​nogic1008</code></a></p>\n<p>For caching, the action uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/cache\"><code>@​toolkit/cache</code></a> library under the hood, which in turn allows getting rid of configuring the <a

Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>[#907](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/907) &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/907&gt;</code>_: Avoid remote calls during startup as <code>execnet</code> by default does not ensure remote affinity with the\nmain thread and might accidentally schedule the pytest worker into a non-main thread, which breaks numerous frameworks,\nfor example <code>asyncio</code>, <code>anyio</code>, <code>PyQt/PySide</code>, etc.</p>\n<p>A more safe correction will require thread affinity in <code>execnet</code> (<code>pytest-dev/execnet#96 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/execnet/issues/96&gt;</code>__).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>pytest-xdist 3.3.0 (2023-05-12)</h1>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>[#555](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/555) &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/555&gt;</code>_: Improved progress output when collecting nodes to be less verbose.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>pytest-xdist 3.2.1 (2023-03-12)</h1>\n<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>[#884](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/884) &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/884&gt;</code>_: Fixed hang in <code>worksteal</code> scheduler.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>pytest-xdist 3.2.0 (2023-02-07)</h1>\n<h2>Improved Documentation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>[#863](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/863) &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/863&gt;</code>_: Document limitations for debugging due to standard I/O of workers not being forwarded. Also, mention remote debugging as a possible workaround.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>[#855](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/855) &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/855&gt;</code>_: Users can now configure <code>load</code> scheduling precision using <code>--maxschedchunk</code> command\nline option.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>[#858](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/858) &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/858&gt;</code><em>: New <code>worksteal</code> scheduler, based on the idea of <code>work stealing &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_stealing&gt;</code></em>. It's similar to <code>load</code> scheduler, but it should handle tests with significantly differing duration better, and, at the same time, it should provide similar or better reuse of fixtures.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Trivial Changes</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Description\r\nThis is a housekeeping MR, meant to simplify the project complexity at root. Tooling and CQ config files (bandit, py-codecoverage, pylint, mypy, pytest) have been moved into `pyproject.toml`, since it is becoming the standard way of defining all tooling-config in python (Ref: https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/)\r\n\r\nNOTE: `tox.ini` has been left as-is, since it was larger, and probably can be addressed in a separate MR (so that this MR is simple to review). Additionally, `flake8` config file has also been left as-is, as [they have decided](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8/issues/234) to not yet officially support pyprojecte\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nDone,

This only impacts users who\nbuild <code>cryptography</code> from source (i.e., not from a <code>wheel</code>), and\nspecify their own version of OpenSSL. For those users, the <code>CFLAGS</code>,\n<code>LDFLAGS</code>, <code>INCLUDE</code>, <code>LIB</code>, and <code>CRYPTOGRAPHY_SUPPRESS_LINK_FLAGS</code>\nenvironment variables are no longer valid. Instead, users need to configure\ntheir builds <code>as documented here</code>_.</li>\n<li>Support for Python 3.6 is deprecated and will be removed in the next\nrelease.</li>\n<li>Deprecated the current minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) of 1.48.0.\nIn the next release we will raise MSRV to 1.56.0. Users with the latest\n<code>pip</code> will typically get a wheel and not need Rust installed, but check\n:doc:<code>/installation</code> for documentation on installing a newer <code>rustc</code> if\nrequired.</li>\n<li>Deprecated support for OpenSSL less than 1.1.1d. The next release of\n<code>cryptography</code> will drop support for older versions.</li>\n<li>Deprecated support for DSA keys in\n:func:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.load_ssh_public_key</code>\nand\n:func:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.load_ssh_private_key</code>.</li>\n<li>Deprecated support for OpenSSH serialization in\n:class:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.dsa.DSAPublicKey</code>\nand\n:class:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.dsa.DSAPrivateKey</code>.</li>\n<li>The minimum supported version of PyPy3 is now 7.3.10.</li>\n<li>Updated Windows, macOS, and Linux wheels to be compiled with OpenSSL 3.1.0.</li>\n<li>Added support for parsing SSH certificates in addition to public keys with\n:func:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.load_ssh_public_identity</code>.\n:func:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.load_ssh_public_key</code>\ncontinues to support only public keys.\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

This results in a large amount of time spent opening connections and verifying SSL certificates.  The proposed change only creates a new connection if any of the host/port/secure settings have changed.\r\n\r\nIn theory, for HTTP-based providers there is never a need to explicitly create a new connection because the [underlying Requests/urllib3 libraries](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/d163f9ba5938aff7d23dec72fa549a482f6836c7/libcloud/http.py#L228-L255) will create new connections as needed.  However, the underlying `LibcloudConnection` class treats host an immutable, so the session it creates will only ever be used for a single host/port.  For this reason, we only need to re-`connect()` when the host/port changes.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nDone, ready for review.\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [X] [Code

operations would fail if an object happened to be\n  in the top-half of the memory-space.

This only impacts users who\nbuild <code>cryptography</code> from source (i.e., not from a <code>wheel</code>), and\nspecify their own version of OpenSSL. For those users, the <code>CFLAGS</code>,\n<code>LDFLAGS</code>, <code>INCLUDE</code>, <code>LIB</code>, and <code>CRYPTOGRAPHY_SUPPRESS_LINK_FLAGS</code>\nenvironment variables are no longer valid. Instead, users need to configure\ntheir builds <code>as documented here</code>_.</li>\n<li>Support for Python 3.6 is deprecated and will be removed in the next\nrelease.</li>\n<li>Deprecated the current minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) of 1.48.0.\nIn the next release we will raise MSRV to 1.56.0. Users with the latest\n<code>pip</code> will typically get a wheel and not need Rust installed, but check\n:doc:<code>/installation</code> for documentation on installing a newer <code>rustc</code> if\nrequired.</li>\n<li>Deprecated support for OpenSSL less than 1.1.1d.

INCOMPATIBLE:</strong> As announced in the 39.0.0 changelog, the way\n<code>cryptography</code> links OpenSSL has changed. This only impacts users who\nbuild <code>cryptography</code> from source (i.e., not from a <code>wheel</code>), and\nspecify their own version of OpenSSL. For those users, the <code>CFLAGS</code>,\n<code>LDFLAGS</code>, <code>INCLUDE</code>, <code>LIB</code>, and <code>CRYPTOGRAPHY_SUPPRESS_LINK_FLAGS</code>\nenvironment variables are no longer valid. Instead, users need to configure\ntheir builds <code>as documented here</code>_.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Support for Python 3.6 is deprecated and will be removed in the next\nrelease.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deprecated the current minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) of 1.48.0.\nIn the next release we will raise MSRV to 1.56.0. Users with the latest\n<code>pip</code> will typically get a wheel and not need Rust installed, but check\n:doc:<code>/installation</code> for documentation on installing a newer <code>rustc</code> if\nrequired.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deprecated support for OpenSSL less than 1.1.1d. The next release of\n<code>cryptography</code> will drop support for older versions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deprecated support for DSA keys in\n:func:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.load_ssh_public_key</code>\nand\n:func:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.load_ssh_private_key</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deprecated support for OpenSSH serialization in\n:class:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.dsa.DSAPublicKey</code>\nand\n:class:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.dsa.DSAPrivateKey</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The minimum supported version of PyPy3 is now 7.3.10.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Updated Windows, macOS, and Linux wheels to be compiled with OpenSSL 3.1.0.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added support for parsing SSH certificates in addition to public keys with\n:func:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.load_ssh_public_identity</code>.\n:func:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.load_ssh_public_key</code>\ncontinues to support only public keys.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added support for generating SSH certificates with\n:class:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.SSHCertificateBuilder</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added :meth:<code>~cryptography.x509.Certificate.verify_directly_issued_by</code> to\n:class:<code>~cryptography.x509.Certificate</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added a check to :class:<code>~cryptography.x509.NameConstraints</code> to ensure that\n:class:<code>~cryptography.x509.DNSName</code> constraints do not contain any <code>*</code>\nwildcards.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed many unused CFFI OpenSSL bindings. This will not impact you unless\nyou are using <code>cryptography</code> to directly invoke OpenSSL's C API. Note that\nthese have never been considered a stable, supported, public API by\n<code>cryptography</code>, this note is included as a courtesy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The X.509 builder classes now raise <code>UnsupportedAlgorithm</code> instead of\n<code>ValueError</code> if an unsupported hash algorithm is passed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added public union type aliases for type hinting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Asymmetric types:\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Fix list_volumes, and list_nodes in Outsale provider \r\n### Description\r\n\r\nthe way `list_nodes` was listing `privates_ips` and `public_ips` was buggy. and either empty, or crash in a few case. (if `\"Nics\" in vm` where true)\r\nthe only was to get IPs was using `node.extra['PublicIp'/'PrivateIp']`, this patch enable user to get ip, using `node.public_ips` (but list only main ip)\r\n\r\nalso it seems `_to_volumes` was broken due to it calling `_to_volumes` instead of `_to_volume`\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that

to help us set the stable style for next year.</p>\n<p>In addition to style changes, Black now automatically infers the supported Python versions from your <code>pyproject.toml</code> file, removing the need to set Black's target versions separately.</p>\n<h3>Stable style</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<ul>\n<li>Introduce the 2023 stable style, which incorporates most aspects of last year's

Optimize read_in_chunks\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe noticed that utils.files.read_in_chunks has significant memory & CPU cost when up or downloading large files with mismatching chunk sizes. This PR attempts to fix that by potentially yielding multiple chunks per read and by avoiding large slicing ops. This seems to remove some more than quadratic scaling, bringing massive speed ups. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport tracemalloc\r\n\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport time\r\n\r\nfrom libcloud.utils.files

This was due to\na race condition that has always been possible and is still possible. In\n7.0.1 and before, the error was silently swallowed by the combining code.\nNow it will produce a message &quot;Couldn't combine data file&quot; and ignore the\ndata file as it used to do before 7.0.2.  Closes <code>issue 1522</code>_.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _issue 1522: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1522\">nedbat/coveragepy#1522</a></p>\n<p>.. _changes_7-0-2:</p>\n<h2>Version 7.0.2 — 2023-01-02</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: when using the <code>[run] relative_files = True</code> setting, a relative\n<code>[paths]</code> pattern was still being made absolute.  This is now fixed,\nclosing <code>issue 1519</code>_.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: if Python doesn't provide tomllib, then TOML configuration files can\nonly be read if coverage.py is installed with the <code>[toml]</code> extra.\nCoverage.py will raise an error if TOML support is not installed when it sees</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

file names was accidentally disabled,\nresulting in sometimes drastic reductions in performance.  This is now fixed,\nclosing <code>issue 1527</code>_.   Thanks to Ivan Ciuvalschii for the reproducible test\ncase.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _issue 1527: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1527\">nedbat/coveragepy#1527</a></p>\n<p>.. _changes_7-0-3:</p>\n<h2>Version 7.0.3 — 2023-01-03</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: when using pytest-cov or pytest-xdist, or perhaps both, the combining\nstep could fail with <code>assert row is not None</code> using 7.0.2.  This was due to\na race condition that has always been possible and is still possible. In\n7.0.1 and before, the error was silently swallowed by the combining code.\nNow it will produce a message &quot;Couldn't combine data file&quot; and ignore the\ndata file as it used to do before 7.0.2.  Closes <code>issue 1522</code>_.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _issue 1522: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1522\">nedbat/coveragepy#1522</a></p>\n<p>.. _changes_7-0-2:</p>\n<h2>Version 7.0.2 — 2023-01-02</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: when using the <code>[run] relative_files = True</code> setting, a relative\n<code>[paths]</code> pattern was still being made absolute.  This is now fixed,\nclosing <code>issue 1519</code>_.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: if Python doesn't provide tomllib, then TOML configuration files can\nonly be read if coverage.py is installed with the <code>[toml]</code> extra.\nCoverage.py will raise an error if TOML support is not installed when it sees\nyour settings are in a .toml file. But it didn't understand that\n<code>[tools.coverage]</code> was a valid section header, so the error wasn't reported\nif you used that header, and settings were silently ignored.  This is now\nfixed, closing <code>issue 1516</code>_.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: adjusted how decorators are traced on PyPy 7.3.10, fixing <code>issue 1515</code>_.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: the <code>coverage lcov</code> report did not properly implement the\n<code>--fail-under=MIN</code> option.  This has been fixed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Refactor: added many type annotations, including a number of refactorings.\nThis should not affect outward behavior, but they were a bit invasive in some</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

pytest-xdist, or perhaps both, the combining\nstep could fail with <code>assert row is not None</code> using 7.0.2.  This was due to\na race condition that has always been possible and is still possible. In\n7.0.1 and before, the error was silently swallowed by the combining code.\nNow it will produce a message &quot;Couldn't combine data file&quot; and ignore the\ndata file as it used to do before 7.0.2.  Closes <code>issue 1522</code>_.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _issue 1522: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1522\">nedbat/coveragepy#1522</a></p>\n<p>.. _changes_7-0-2:</p>\n<h2>Version 7.0.2 — 2023-01-02</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: when using the <code>[run] relative_files = True</code> setting, a relative\n<code>[paths]</code> pattern was still being made absolute.  This is now fixed,\nclosing <code>issue 1519</code>_.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: if Python doesn't provide tomllib, then TOML configuration files can\nonly be read if coverage.py is installed with the <code>[toml]</code> extra.\nCoverage.py will raise an error if TOML support is not installed when it sees\nyour settings are in a .toml file. But it didn't understand that\n<code>[tools.coverage]</code> was a valid section header, so the error wasn't reported\nif you used that header, and settings were silently ignored.  This is now\nfixed, closing <code>issue 1516</code>_.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: adjusted how decorators are traced on PyPy 7.3.10, fixing <code>issue 1515</code>_.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: the <code>coverage lcov</code> report did not properly implement the\n<code>--fail-under=MIN</code> option.  This has been fixed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Refactor: added many type annotations, including a number of refactorings.\nThis should not affect outward behavior, but they were a bit invasive in some\nplaces, so keep your eyes peeled for oddities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Refactor: removed the vestigial and long untested support for Jython and\nIronPython.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _issue 1515: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1515\">nedbat/coveragepy#1515</a>\n.. _issue 1516: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1516\">nedbat/coveragepy#1516</a>\n.. _issue 1519: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1519\">nedbat/coveragepy#1519</a></p>\n<p>.. _changes_7-0-1:</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/2ff9098b41f3dfa4fdb4345028948ee6436d9d85\"><code>2ff9098</code></a> docs: prep for 7.0.3</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/1f34d8b095d8e7c9d3276f1fc768a5d83d9e2aff\"><code>1f34d8b</code></a> fix: race condition on data file shouldn't break combining. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1522\">#1522</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/85170bf147c93f88c9d1580de3eb53da01082f18\"><code>85170bf</code></a> build: two-step combines for speed</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/1605f07f9ab32a01debf5baffdba2831815c5919\"><code>1605f07</code></a> mypy: misc.py, test_misc.py</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/4f3ccf213d813bb57775b2643b8bae5e08cbbbd0\"><code>4f3ccf2</code></a> refactor: a better way to have maybe-importable third-party modules</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/98301ed240a141592573c2ed239e006d42a26161\"><code>98301ed</code></a> mypy: test_config.py, test_context.py</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/9d2e1b055cf7ed02eba725b86d476c24a718178d\"><code>9d2e1b0</code></a> mypy: test_concurrency.py, test_python.py</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/c3ee30c1cfd133f1e36a4a8992b531a0dc7ec5a9\"><code>c3ee30c</code></a> refactor(test): use tmp_path instead of tmpdir</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/0b05b45e342813b34d906e840e253a06b37133ae\"><code>0b05b45</code></a> mypy: test_annotate.py test_arcs.py test_collector.py</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/2090f79d4a0447f4d3744ea957fcebd951f0b843\"><code>2090f79</code></a> style: better</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/compare/7.0.1...7.0.3\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=coverage&package-manager=pip&previous-version=7.0.1&new-version=7.0.3)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

<code>[run] relative_files = True</code> setting, a relative\n<code>[paths]</code> pattern was still being made absolute.  This is now fixed,\nclosing <code>issue 1519</code>_.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: if Python doesn't provide tomllib, then TOML configuration files can\nonly be read if coverage.py is installed with the <code>[toml]</code> extra.\nCoverage.py will raise an error if TOML support is not installed when it sees\nyour settings are in a .toml file. But it didn't understand that\n<code>[tools.coverage]</code> was a valid section header, so the error wasn't reported\nif you used that header, and settings were silently ignored.  This is now\nfixed, closing <code>issue 1516</code>_.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: adjusted how decorators are traced on PyPy 7.3.10, fixing <code>issue 1515</code>_.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: the <code>coverage lcov</code> report did not properly implement the\n<code>--fail-under=MIN</code> option.  This has been fixed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Refactor: added many type annotations, including a number of refactorings.\nThis should not affect outward behavior, but they were a bit invasive in some\nplaces, so keep your eyes peeled for oddities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Refactor: removed the vestigial and long untested support for Jython and\nIronPython.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _issue 1515: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1515\">nedbat/coveragepy#1515</a>\n.. _issue 1516: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1516\">nedbat/coveragepy#1516</a>\n.. _issue 1519: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1519\">nedbat/coveragepy#1519</a></p>\n<p>.. _changes_7-0-1:</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/2f731e27c227512594b0378820a42503486ca2d5\"><code>2f731e2</code></a> docs: sample HTML</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/dbbd5b73237c75a14f7430e75412b577f4d8f4ed\"><code>dbbd5b7</code></a> docs: prep for 7.0.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/d08e6d08cb01d07209bcc5a96807e48eeb593ed9\"><code>d08e6d0</code></a> fix: relative_files should keep relative path maps. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1519\">#1519</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/3f0bce2f5f4658bfa1d9cd6ddb2f6d7e520897e8\"><code>3f0bce2</code></a> mypy: partial debug.py and pytracer.py</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/ffc701a47a9a6285d3a65cad893e514f5db39a54\"><code>ffc701a</code></a> mypy: test_xml.py</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/5580cf8a97841f0a385ebd048aa389f942d316f5\"><code>5580cf8</code></a> mypy: xmlreport.py</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/0c9b5e0e9da9c2cffd50db7b28142d22d0f66cee\"><code>0c9b5e0</code></a> mypy: check collector.py and plugin_support.py</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/8f4d404c8f9044ea1c3bf2479236f51d7706cb76\"><code>8f4d404</code></a> refactor: a better way to filter <code>coverage debug pybehave</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/a3f3841b746a1789ff8f7fea0cc0715c45770996\"><code>a3f3841</code></a> mypy: add cmdline.py and test_cmdline.py</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/09f9188e826f900198d638ee3c42b27bca29597d\"><code>09f9188</code></a> mypy: add env.py</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/compare/7.0.1...7.0.2\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=coverage&package-manager=pip&previous-version=7.0.1&new-version=7.0.2)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

[cryptography](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography) from 38.0.4 to 39.0.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/blob/main/CHANGELOG.rst\">cryptography's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>39.0.0 - 2023-01-01</p>\n<pre><code>\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Support for OpenSSL 1.1.0 has been removed.\n  Users on older version of OpenSSL will need to upgrade.\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Dropped support for LibreSSL &lt; 3.5. The new\n  minimum LibreSSL version is 3.5.0. Going forward our policy is to support\n  versions of LibreSSL that are available in versions of OpenBSD that are\n  still receiving security support.\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Removed the ``encode_point`` and\n  ``from_encoded_point`` methods on\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePublicNumbers`,\n  which had been deprecated for several years.\n  :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePublicKey.public_bytes`\n  and\n  :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePublicKey.from_encoded_point`\n  should be used instead.\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Support for using MD5 or SHA1 in\n  :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateBuilder`, other X.509 builders, and\n  PKCS7 has been removed.\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Dropped support for macOS 10.10 and 10.11, macOS\n  users must upgrade to 10.12 or newer.\n* **ANNOUNCEMENT:** The next version of ``cryptography`` (40.0) will change\n  the way we link OpenSSL. This will only impact users who build\n  ``cryptography`` from source (i.e., not from a ``wheel``), and specify their\n  own version of OpenSSL. For those users, the ``CFLAGS``, ``LDFLAGS``,\n  ``INCLUDE``, ``LIB``, and ``CRYPTOGRAPHY_SUPPRESS_LINK_FLAGS`` environment\n  variables will no longer be respected. Instead, users will need to\n  configure their builds `as documented here`_.\n* Added support for\n  :ref:`disabling the legacy provider in OpenSSL 3.0.x&lt;legacy-provider&gt;`.\n* Added support for disabling RSA key validation checks when loading RSA\n  keys via\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.load_pem_private_key`,\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.load_der_private_key`,\n  and\n  :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.rsa.RSAPrivateNumbers.private_key`.\n  This speeds up key loading but is :term:`unsafe` if you are loading potentially\n  attacker supplied keys.\n* Significantly improved performance for\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead.ChaCha20Poly1305`\n  when repeatedly calling ``encrypt`` or ``decrypt`` with the same key.\n* Added support for creating OCSP requests with precomputed hashes using\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.ocsp.OCSPRequestBuilder.add_certificate_by_hash`.\n* Added support for loading multiple PEM-encoded X.509 certificates from\n  a single input via :func:`~cryptography.x509.load_pem_x509_certificates`.\n<p>.. _v38-0-4:\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/338a65a7df74e189f6b5d1d3a6315ffa911b21c2\"><code>338a65a</code></a> 39.0.0 version bump (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/7954\">#7954</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/84a3cd7abb16f594d8c315e8aedb4be02583bf6a\"><code>84a3cd7</code></a> automatically download and upload circleci wheels (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/7949\">#7949</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/525c0b3d5d89eab7f953be5de5d2b75da1c816f8\"><code>525c0b3</code></a> Type annotate release.py (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/7951\">#7951</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/46d2a94d1b574abf5b9e88f84fa7400a138c4edb\"><code>46d2a94</code></a> Use the latest 3.10 release when wheel building (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/7953\">#7953</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/f150dc15582c05b1b94cf08ed3b1fbc9c4f52267\"><code>f150dc1</code></a> fix CI to work with ubuntu 22.04 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/7950\">#7950</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/8867724b2b6db528d2900414ef86c122a1f5602a\"><code>8867724</code></a> fix README for python3 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/7947\">#7947</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/4de6304884a752014cb9ad0f67453a5292dfa468\"><code>4de6304</code></a> Bump BoringSSL and/or OpenSSL in CI (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/7946\">#7946</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/0a02a7dacf8578ef77991663bbfbfa8770c8f952\"><code>0a02a7d</code></a> Replace more deprecated <code>abstractproperty</code> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/7944\">#7944</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/c28bfb352ab1f390900ef92856a9570aadd5fe2c\"><code>c28bfb3</code></a> src/_cffi_src/openssl/evp.py: export EVP_PKEY_set_alias_type in FUNCTIONS (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/7\">#7</a>...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/438f78179c23f226e387c33db703f541b7cecdec\"><code>438f781</code></a> Typo fixes (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/7942\">#7942</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/compare/38.0.4...39.0.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=cryptography&package-manager=pip&previous-version=38.0.4&new-version=39.0.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

If you develop a theme or extension that uses the\n<code>jQuery</code>, <code>$</code>, or <code>$u</code> global objects, you need to update your\nJavaScript to modern standards, or use the mitigation below.</p>\n<p>The first option is to use the sphinxcontrib.jquery_ extension, which has been\ndeveloped by the Sphinx team and contributors. To use this, add\n<code>sphinxcontrib.jquery</code> to the <code>extensions</code> list in <code>conf.py</code>, or call\n<code>app.setup_extension(&quot;sphinxcontrib.jquery&quot;)</code> if you develop a Sphinx theme\nor extension.</p>\n<p>The second option is to manually ensure that the frameworks are present.\nTo re-add jQuery and underscore.js, you will need to copy <code>jquery.js</code> and\n<code>underscore.js</code> from <code>the Sphinx repository</code>_ to your <code>static</code> directory,\nand add the following to your <code>layout.html</code>:</p>\n<p>.. code-block:: html+jinja</p>\n<p>{%- block scripts %}\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n{{ super() }}\n{%- endblock %}</p>\n<p>.. _sphinxcontrib.jquery: <a href=\"https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/jquery/\">https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/jquery/</a></p>\n<p>Patch by Adam Turner.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/10471\">#10471</a>, <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/10565\">#10565</a>: Removed deprecated APIs scheduled for removal in Sphinx 6.0.

href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/blob/master/CHANGES.rst\">coverage's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Version 7.0.0 — 2022-12-18</h2>\n<p>Nothing new beyond 7.0.0b1.</p>\n<p>.. _changes_7-0-0b1:</p>\n<h2>Version 7.0.0b1 — 2022-12-03</h2>\n<p>A number of changes have been made to file path handling, including pattern\nmatching and path remapping with the <code>[paths]</code> setting (see\n:ref:<code>config_paths</code>).  These changes might affect you, and require you to\nupdate your settings.</p>\n<p>(This release includes the changes from <code>6.6.0b1 &lt;changes_6-6-0b1_&gt;</code>_, since\n6.6.0 was never released.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Changes to file pattern matching, which might require updating your\nconfiguration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Previously, <code>*</code> would incorrectly match directory separators, making\nprecise matching difficult.  This is now fixed, closing <code>issue 1407</code>_.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Now <code>**</code> matches any number of nested directories, including none.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvements to combining data files when using the\n:ref:<code>config_run_relative_files</code> setting, which might require updating your\nconfiguration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>During <code>coverage combine</code>, relative file paths are implicitly combined\nwithout needing a <code>[paths]</code> configuration setting.  This also fixed\n<code>issue 991</code>_.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A <code>[paths]</code> setting like <code>*/foo</code> will now match <code>foo/bar.py</code> so that\nrelative file paths can be combined more easily.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The :ref:<code>config_run_relative_files</code> setting is properly interpreted in\nmore places, fixing <code>issue 1280</code>_.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When remapping file paths with <code>[paths]</code>, a path will be remapped only if\nthe resulting path exists.  The documentation has long said the prefix had to\nexist, but it was never enforced.  This fixes <code>issue 608</code><em>, improves <code>issue 649</code></em>, and closes <code>issue 757</code>_.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reporting operations now implicitly use the <code>[paths]</code> setting to remap file\npaths within a single data file.  Combining multiple files still requires the\n<code>coverage combine</code> step, but this simplifies some single-file situations.\nCloses <code>issue 1212</code>_ and <code>issue 713</code>_.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
