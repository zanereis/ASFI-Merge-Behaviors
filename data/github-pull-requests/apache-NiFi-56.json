you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nAs other properties are allowed to be set via environment variable for the docker image (using docker-compose for example), this PR adds the analytics/prediction properties to that list, so for example you can enable connection status analytics/predictions by setting an environment variable to `true`.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nThe NiFi SQL table models in the nifi-sql-reporting-tasks module do not need to depend on ReportingContext, so that dependency should be replaced with the actual objects that are dependencies. For modularity the table models (and supporting interfaces/utils) should be moved out into an API JAR for use by nifi-sql-reporting-tasks for example. \r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-08T18:19:58Z","updated_at":"2021-05-11T00:04:29Z","closed_at":"2021-05-11T00:04:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6e705ffd275982ef8d4a6024101e88aa6161a08c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2915399856,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTE1Mzk5ODU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4197/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4197/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4197/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/c8e1c957db546e1d7f8adcd70654340dbeb0db7e","head":{"label":"mattyb149:NIFI-7342","ref":"NIFI-7342","sha":"c8e1c957db546e1d7f8adcd70654340dbeb0db7e","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28576559,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU3NjU1OQ==","name":"nifi","full_name":"mattyb149/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149/nifi","description":"Mirror

is a proposal to handle the issues described in [NIFI-7292](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-7292). The solution proposal aims directly the effects of files and folders are not accessible by NiFi due to insufficient privileges. One of my primary goals was to minimise the change and keep using the -otherwise- properly working `FileTreeWalker` based implementation. In order to this, I did replace the `find` call with `walkFileTree`, which provides a more direct access to the file visiting with tree walker. With this, the code have more control over handling inaccessible files and folders, preventing the tree walker from instantly stopping. With the proposed behaviour in case of insufficient privileges, the listing skips the given files or subfolders.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_This PR introduces a new page in the Apache NiFi documentation which contains prescriptive guides to perform common admin and user actions from standard baselines. It is not complete, but in my opinion it is sufficient to publish and help people now, with the intention to continue developing it._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

two tickets are interconnecting and the changes were made around the same piece of code.\r\n\r\nAs the JSON files are read without considering the schema used for validation, it might happen that a class it uses to store JSON field value differs from the\r\ndata type we expect in the validation schema. This is possible even if based on the field value it might be fitting. In order to avoid false-negative schema validation results,\r\nI propose this fix around type validation.\r\n\r\nwhich we expect to be a long is parsed into an integer based on its current value. During validation the AVRO record incorrectly ends up as invalid (because of an integer is not considered as long in this example). This is a fix for allow narrow numeric data types for fit into wider types during schema based validation.\r\n\r\nExample for NIFI-7300:\r\n\r\nExisting behaviour:\r\nStep 1.: incoming value is 5\r\nStep 2.: record is being read, the representing object will be an Integer\r\nStep 3.: the record is validated against a schema which expect the field to be a Long\r\nStep 4.: the record is invalid as the Integer field is not considered as valid Long\r\n\r\nProposed behaviour:\r\nStep 1-3.: the same as the existing behaviour\r\nStep 4.: as Integer is considered as a narrow data type of Long, the record is considered as valid\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\nBuilding on top of RecordFieldType's existing \"narrowDataTypes\" collection, in case of numeric types, I extended the validation check with the check of these narrow types: if the incoming value fits to the original, or any of the narrow types, it is considered as valid.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nEven if String also has a numerous amount of narrow types for example, in order to keep compatibility I did not extended other data types with this fix, only numeric ones. Extending them would be a change of behaviour instead of a fix. See TestValidateRecord#testValidateMissingRequiredArray which for example breaks if narrow types would be allowed for Strings.\r\n\r\nExample for NIFI-7302:\r\n\r\nExisting behaviour:\r\nStep 1.: incoming value is 1.5191525220870972\r\nStep 2.: record is being read, the representing object will be a Double\r\nStep 3.: the record is validated against a schema which expect the field to be a Float\r\nStep 4.: the record is invalid as the Double field is not considered as valid Float\r\n\r\nProposed behaviour:\r\nStep 1-3.: the same as the existing behaviour\r\nStep 4.: As the incoming value might be represented as Float, is is accepted as valid value.\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\nAn intermediate float value is populated with the incoming double and checked against the original double if there was any precision loss during the conversion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

the JSON files are read without considering the schema (used for validation), it might happen that a field which we expect to be a long is parsed into an integer based on its current value. During validation the AVRO record incorrectly ends up as invalid (because of an integer is not considered as long in this example). This is a fix for allow narrow numeric data types for fit into wider types during schema based validation.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nExisting behaviour:\r\n- Step 1.: incoming value is \"5\"\r\n- Step 2.: record is being read, the representing object will be an Integer\r\n- Step 3.: the record is validated against a schema which expect the field to be a Long\r\n- Step 4.: the record is considered as invalid as the Integer field is not considered as valid Long\r\n\r\nProposed behaviour:\r\n- Step 1-3.: the same as the existing behaviour\r\n- Step 4.: as Integer is considered as a narrow data type of Long, the record is considered as valid (if there are no other discrepancies in the record)\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\nBuilding on top of `RecordFieldType's` existing \"narrowDataTypes\" collection, in case of numeric types, I extended the validation check with the check of these narrow types: if the incoming value fits to the original, or any of the narrow types, it is considered as valid.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nEven if String also has a numerous amount of narrow types for example, in order to keep compatibility I did not extended other data types with this fix, only numeric ones. Extending them would be a change of behaviour instead of a fix. See `TestValidateRecord#testValidateMissingRequiredArray` which for example breaks if narrow types would be allowed for Strings.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nAdded functionality to read and write from samba shares with GetSmbFile and PutSmbFile processors. The advantage is to not have to manage cifs mounts on the server/nodes. Also the processors supports windows style share locks on the files during read and write.\r\nIt's using [SMBJ client library](https://github.com/hierynomus/smbj) for the samba connection.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [X] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [X] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [X] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-30T09:59:02Z","updated_at":"2020-08-10T17:11:54Z","closed_at":"2020-08-10T17:11:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7634c1739139a56201a0358d30c06a4aac37e9dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4169/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4169/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4169/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/6dcf94ae2e5f96d3b7c14896d9bcc7ccedc750c9","head":{"label":"si-sun:nifi-smb-processors-pr1","ref":"nifi-smb-processors-pr1","sha":"6dcf94ae2e5f96d3b7c14896d9bcc7ccedc750c9","user":{"login":"si-sun","id":57941650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3OTQxNjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57941650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/si-sun","html_url":"https://github.com/si-sun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/si-sun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/si-sun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/si-sun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/si-sun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/si-sun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/si-sun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/si-sun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/si-sun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/si-sun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":224815782,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjQ4MTU3ODI=","name":"nifi","full_name":"si-sun/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"si-sun","id":57941650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3OTQxNjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57941650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/si-sun","html_url":"https://github.com/si-sun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/si-sun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/si-sun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/si-sun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/si-sun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/si-sun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/si-sun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/si-sun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/si-sun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/si-sun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/si-sun/nifi","description":"Mirror

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nThe reporting task module has a NAR dependency on the standard services API NAR, but the NAR that the reporting task gets bundled into does not have the dependency. This causes a warning on build and can cause issues if using SSL with the PrometheusReportingTask\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nRather than having to add a ReportingTask to the NiFi flow in order for Prometheus to scrape NiFi metrics, this PR exposes a REST endpoint on each node as a scrape target for Prometheus. Metrics include all metrics available from the other Prometheus components in addition to connection analytics/predictions (time to backpressure, e.g.) and bulletins (for integration with AlertMananger)\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Fixed TLS regressions in `OkHttpClient` construction due to missing key password value._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpening this as a replacement/follow-on to PR 4144 which I opened earlier with @thenatog 's changes. I resolved the build errors on OpenJDK 11. This is rebased against current master and includes commit e64815d68e537a88db6ac3db6ef9abfdc1838583 which Nathan added after I'd opened the PR introducing a new test for when the key password is null.

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nAvro maps have Utf8 keys, but DataTypeUtil wants String keys in a map, so when inferring the type of a map, the keys need to be coerced to Strings.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nThe initial issue is that when the server's response is indicating **Content-Encoding** as **GZIP** but with no content, we hit an EOF Exception (see [NIFI-4970](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-4970)). The [first PR #4109](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4109) added a unit test to reproduce the issue and a potential way of dealing with the issue by checking ``responseBody.contentLength() > 0``. The problem is that ``responseBody.contentLength()`` will always be equal to ``-1`` when the server returns a GZIP (with or without actual content) and we're going to ignore the response in case there is content to process. This PR reverts the check but adds a property to let the user decides wether content is expected or not. In case it is expected to have no content from the server, this will be ignored and no exception will be generated.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Community,\r\n\r\nDescription of PR\r\nAdding further functionality to the search in the form of filters. These are key-value pairs might narrow the scope of the search based on metadata of the different components, like their containing process group, etc.\r\n\r\nThis is the pull request for NIFI-7188. The feature is added and the majority of the tests are in place. The following changes are included:\r\n- Refactor in order to make the extension and testing simpler (mainly: splitting the search into smaller chunks with the same functionality)\r\n- A small fix related to the transmission status searching (due to the overlapping keywords, in some cases it returned with invalid result, now that is fixed and tested)\r\n- And the actual filters, affects mainly the following classes: ControllerSearchService, PropertyMatcher\r\n\r\nThanks for your review, please do not hesitate to point out possible issues or derivation from community habits!\r\n\r\nDetails of the concept for easier understanding (focusing on the refactor part):\r\nThe basic concept of the search remained the same. The majority of the code change is splitting the existing code into smaller chunks with more strict boundaries. This came with three new concepts. These are:\r\n\r\n- `AttributeMatcher`: these are small \"search matchers\" focusing on a well defined set of attribute or aspect of a component, for example it's basic attributes (name, id, etc.) or it's current status. They were extracted due to ease the tests and to reuse them if possible.\r\n- `ComponentMatcher`: this class encapsulates all the search matchings belong to a given type of component. The implementation achieves this with a list of attribute matchers.  Basically this covers the functionality of the previous `search` method family within `ControllerSearchService`.\r\n- `ComponentSearchResultEnricher`: previous after-matching enrichment of the results with parental, versional, etc. data is extracted into this concept.\r\n\r\nThe refactored code follows the previous implementation both with data flow and in behaviour expect cases where it is related to the new capabilities or fix (see above). To easily manage the new functionality, two further concepts were needed:\r\n\r\n- Filter: key-value pairs according to the proposal.\r\n- `SearchQuery`: serving as a data object for the search, gathering all the necessary contextual data (search term, requesting user, currently active process group in the UI). It is created by the controller and used as a bases of the search in service level. Also contains filters.\r\n\r\nWith the SearchQeury above, it was simple to add \"filter functionality\" to the necessary places. With the currently supported filters, this means the following:\r\n\r\n- `ControllerSearchService#search`: Scope is managed here. If it appears and valid, we use the currently active (visible on UI) process group as the starting point of the search\r\n- `ControllerSearchService#appliesToGroupFilter`: Decides if the group is eligible for search, based on it's name and id. Called from `#searchInProcessGroup` in order to decide if the components contained should be searched or not.\r\n- `PropertyMatcher#propertiesAreFilteredOut`: Initiated by `#match`. If applies, this attribute matcher is skipped.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Simplified API and updated tests for the API change.  Verified the functionality now works for GetFTP, FetchFTP, GetSFTP, FetchSFTP using both delete and move modes.  Verified that resources leaked and transfers at times failed previous to the fix.  Verified it does not after the fix.  Verified in the client library code that we needed to be calling these relevant resource cleaning methods which explained the issue.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
