It's also necessary to move forward the following PR:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8055\r\n\r\nWithout that change, for instance, even if `CONFIG_FPU=y` is set in the board config file (like `boards/qemu_x86.conf`) the libraries are built against soft-float because `CONFIG_FPU=y` doesn't take effect and so running some models that rely on float point will fail.\r\n\r\nThis happens because currently board-specific config files (boards/*.conf) are not\r\ncopied from Zephyr project dir to the destination build dir, so\r\nas a consequence the per board configs are not used when building\r\nthe runtime libraries, like libcommon. Hence, for instance, it's\r\ncurrently not possible to set CONFIG_FPU per board since it only\r\ntakes effect when it's set in the generic 'prj.con' config file.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes it by copying to the build dir, to each lib\r\ndir, the proper .conf for the selected target board. For example,\r\nif target 'qemu_x86' is selected 'qemu_x86.conf' is copied to\r\nthe boards/ dir inside the lib dirs, so Zephyr build system can\r\nfind it and combine it with configs found in the generic 'prj.conf'.\r\n\r\nThanks & best regards,\r\nGustavo","created_at":"2021-06-09T23:58:31Z","updated_at":"2021-06-11T06:06:47Z","closed_at":"2021-06-11T06:06:47Z","merged_at":"2021-06-11T06:06:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"c29301ea654d307ccf17dde7d19f1cbe15f54586","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8230/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8230/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8230/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/4c37f5440a73131ed4cc77d95ea9bd9e9b006942","head":{"label":"gromero:fix-per-board-conf","ref":"fix-per-board-conf","sha":"4c37f5440a73131ed4cc77d95ea9bd9e9b006942","user":{"login":"gromero","id":3375505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzU1MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3375505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero","html_url":"https://github.com/gromero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":328811256,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjg4MTEyNTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"gromero/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gromero","id":3375505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzU1MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3375505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero","html_url":"https://github.com/gromero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gromero/tvm","description":"Open

default number of threads in reduction kernels for Metal.\r\nDefault code generation generated thread block with the following size:\r\n32x32x1. With this size number of threads per threadgroup was equal to\r\n1024 (32 * 32 * 1). Sometimes device doesn't have enough resources and\r\nin this case we will get an exception that the block size is greater\r\nthan value of maxTotalThreadsPerThreadgroup.\r\nTo prevent such situation we decrease default number of threads.

refactoring from #8188.  The goal of this PR is to establish clear ownership of vulkan resources.  Previously, resources were owned both by VulkanDeviceAPI and by VulkanThreadEntry, depending on whether it is a per-CPU-thread resource.  This PR introduces a `ThreadMap<T>` class that behaves similarly to `thread_local`, but can be used for non-static data members, then uses `ThreadMap<T>` to move all ownership of vulkan resources to be relative to the `VulkanDeviceAPI`.  Individual steps are in separate commits for readability.\r\n\r\n* Moved ownership of per-thread active device id to VulkanDeviceAPI\r\n\r\n  * Previously, the active device was owned by VulkanThreadEntry, so lookups to multiple global variables were required.  Now, everything goes from the VulkanDeviceAPI.\r\n\r\n  * Removed VulkanThreadEntry, as all functionality has been moved to either VulkanDevice or VulkanDeviceAPI.\r\n\r\n* Moved ownership of per-thread workspace pool to VulkanDeviceAPI\r\n\r\n  * Previously, the WorkspacePool was owned by VulkanThreadEntry, and required a lookup from VulkanDeviceAPI::AllocWorkspace.  As a result, non-global VulkanDeviceAPI would interact with each other.\r\n\r\n* Move ownership of per-thread uniform buffer to VulkanDevice\r\n\r\n  * Previously, VulkanUniformBuffer was owned by VulkanThreadEntry, so any use required looking up both the thread entry and the device. Now, thread-specific lookup is handled in the VulkanDevice class.\r\n\r\n* Move the VulkanStagingBuffer to be owned by the VulkanDevice\r\n\r\n  * Previously, was owned by VulkanThreadEntry, so any use required looking up both the thread entry and the device.  Now, thread-specific lookup is handled in the VulkanDevice class.\r\n\r\n* Pulled VulkanBuffer allocation/deallocation into constructor/destructor.\r\n\r\n  * VulkanBuffer owns the VkBuffer and VkDeviceMemory that it allocates, and deallocates on destruction.\r\n\r\n  * VulkanHostVisibleBuffer owns a VulkanBuffer, and additional calls vkUnmapMemory on destruction.\r\n\r\n* Moved VulkanStream ownership from VulkanThreadEntry to VulkanDevice\r\n\r\n  * Implemented ThreadMap, a container for per-thread objects.  Unlike dmlc::ThreadLocalStore, ThreadMap is intended for use as a non-static thread-specific lookup.\r\n\r\n  * Added ThreadMap<VulkanStream> as a member to VulkanDevice, updated all uses.\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-04T17:18:38Z","updated_at":"2021-06-11T14:50:09Z","closed_at":"2021-06-11T07:57:28Z","merged_at":"2021-06-11T07:57:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"f906fa8d6c5ba3587bcbf328b2a562d87cfd6163","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858780915,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3ODA5MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20review","name":"status:

PR tries to fix PReLU bug mentioned in https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8184\r\nReference: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.PReLU.html#torch.nn.PReLU\r\n\r\nIn short, there are two situations we need to consider:\r\n1. When input dims < 2. PReLU in Pytorch can deal with this, while in TVM the default axis of `tvm.relay.nn.prelu` is set to 1, we will encounter an error when directly calling this function.\r\n2. When input dims >= 2, input channel > 1 and num_parameters = 1. In this case will need to do a broadcasting on the alpha parameter.\r\n\r\n@masahi  Please take a look at this PR,

step of the refactoring initiated in #8157.  Each of the following changes is implemented in a separate commit in this PR.\r\n\r\n- Broke out `VkInstance` setup/teardown into managed class.  Previously, the `VkInstance` was directly owned by the `VulkanDeviceAPI`.  Now, `VulkanDeviceAPI` owns a `tvm::runtime::vulkan::VulkanInstance` that does setup/teardown of the `VkInstance`.  This way, the teardown is done even if a later initialization step throws an exception.\r\n\r\n- Renamed `VulkanContext` to `VulkanDevice`, to match with the `tvm.context` to `tvm.device` rename.\r\n\r\n- Extracted `VulkanDevice` initialization into `VulkanDevice` class\r\n\r\n- Removed the `VkPhysicalDeviceProperties` member variable from `VulkanDevice`.  With the separate `VulkanDeviceProperties` class, this moves all device parameter query/access to a single

PR refactors the current `tensorflow.py` parser and separates the code for the ops into a separate file `tensorflow_ops.py`. The new parser for handling tensorflow2 models in TVM, ie `tensorflow2.py`, imports the existing frontend op codes from `tensorflow.py`. With the current PR both of these frontend codes will import the ops from a common file for the ops in `tensorflow_ops.py`. \r\n\r\nThis PR is in line with the original plan of supporting tensorflow2 parser in TVM frontend as in the discussion [#4102 ](https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4102) Exact commit plan [here](https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4102#issuecomment-784456088).\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Rohan Mukherjee <mukrohan@amazon.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Xingyu Zhou <zhoxingy@amazon.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: David Huang <davhuan@amazon.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Srinidhi Goud <srinidhi.goud29@gmail.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Xiao <weix@amazon.com>\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

follow up to https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7796 adding support for converting TF combined nms using all_class_nms. \r\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image/combined_non_max_suppression\r\n\r\nTF and ONNX require different output format from combined NMS. To support TF, we need to return outputs differently. Coming up with the right output format for TF turned out to be non trivial, but I found the following worked quite well:\r\n\r\n* `indices` of size (batch_size, num_boxes * num_class, 2)\r\n* `scores` of size (batch_size, num_boxes * num_class)\r\n* `num_detections` of size (batch_size,)\r\n\r\n`indices` and `scores` are outputs from the NMS loop, where the selected box indices/scores come first. They are sorted within a class, but not across classes. Since TF combined NMS returns `max_total_boxes` out of `num_boxes * num_class`, the frontend code needs to do topk. \r\n\r\nOne complication is even if `num_boxes * num_class` < `max_total_size`, TF returns `max_total_size` boxes with zero padding. Since topi/relay topk op would not work when the size of the axis to select topk elements from is less then k, we need to conditionally do topk depending on the value of `num_boxes`. Since things become complicated when `num_boxes` can be dynamic, I use `all_class_nms` code path only when `num_boxes` is static (which should be no problem in practice). Moreover, `all_class_nms` does not support `q != 1` case. So if `q != 1` or the number of boxes is dynamic, we still use the old converter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to expected speed up from parallelizing the NMS loop across different classes, this change enables running TF detection models with graph runtime, since the output from TF combined nms is always of size `max_total_size` and we no longer need to do dynamic slicing.\r\n\r\nplease review @trevor-m

PR makes two changes which will help reduce GPU memory usage by TensorRT for models that use a dynamic batch dimension (tensors with shape like `(relay.Any(), 3, 224, 224)`).\r\n\r\n1. TensorRT engines are built with a \"Max Batch Size\" parameter. This means the engine can be used for inputs with any batch size from 1 to max_batch size. Previously, we built a new TensorRT engine for each unique batch size encountered at runtime. With this PR, when we encounter a new batch size, we will first try to match it to an already built engine with an equal or higher batch size. This will cause only one engine to exist at a given point in time, saving memory.. This is now the default mode. The previous behavior of building unique engine for each batch size is available through env variable `TVM_TENSORRT_MULTI_ENGINE=1`.\r\n\r\n2. Because of the first change, we have to rethink how the GPU device buffers are allocated because now an engine can be used for multiple batch sizes. This PR decouples the device buffers from the engine, so there is only one set of device buffers for subgraph. They will be allocated only for the largest batch size encountered.This will further reduce memory usage since only one buffer per input is allocated, while previously each engine would have its own set of buffer. This will also fix the issue from https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7162.\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-01T20:36:43Z","updated_at":"2021-06-03T00:19:45Z","closed_at":"2021-06-03T00:19:40Z","merged_at":"2021-06-03T00:19:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"cc3d60e6cd4ec674070fd4a5705723c17ee59389","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8172/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8172/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8172/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/9ecf9f7dbb4aebcba4c0deba75809880bebac36c","head":{"label":"trevor-m:trt-dynamic-batching-reuse","ref":"trt-dynamic-batching-reuse","sha":"9ecf9f7dbb4aebcba4c0deba75809880bebac36c","user":{"login":"trevor-m","id":12981474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxNDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m","html_url":"https://github.com/trevor-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":204561313,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDQ1NjEzMTM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"trevor-m/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"trevor-m","id":12981474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxNDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m","html_url":"https://github.com/trevor-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/trevor-m/tvm","description":"Open

PR has two purposes:\r\n1. Add `axes` argument to static param `strided_slice`\r\n2. Refactor `strided_slice` related code so that adding `axes` argument would not increase clutter. Also I did further refactoring to remove duplicated output shape calculation between topi/relay type rel (left as [TODO](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/include/tvm/topi/transform.h#L641-L642)) and minimize the number of `te::compute` for strided slice (currently there are 4 of them).\r\n\r\nFor 1, currently slicing along the **second** axis with input shape `(?, 3)`, begin `[0]`, end `[1]` calls the dynamic parameter variant of relay/topi `strided_slice` with `begin = (0, 0)` and `end = (?, ?)`, which results in the output shape `(?, ?)` rather than desired `(?, 1)`. This causes a problem when the output is fed to `gather_nd` which requires a certain dimension to be static. \r\n\r\nThe root problem is that our `strided_slice` op does not have a notion of `axes` and always tries to slice along all axes. So when some of the dimensions are dynamic, we call dynamic parameter variant of `strided_slice` which makes all input params and the output shape dynamic, even if we only need to slice along static dimensions with static begin/end. My solution adds `axes` argument to static parameter variant of `strided_slice`so that slicing would not touch dynamic dimensions and preserve static dimensions along provided `axes`. \r\n\r\nFor 2, we accumulated many patches for `strided_slice` over the last few years and I found the current implementation extremely messy and hard to maintain. In order not to make the situation worse by introducing `axes` argument, I decided to roll major refactoring of our `strided_slice` related code.\r\n\r\nFirst, the output shape calculation logic is duplicated between topi and relay type rel:\r\n* https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/include/tvm/topi/transform.h#L651-L714\r\n* https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/src/relay/op/tensor/transform.cc#L2451-L2534\r\n\r\nThis has been fixed by introducing [StridedSliceOutputShape function](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/64c1bbf27607de08620c942d41592bae71c0a667/include/tvm/topi/transform.h#L655) in topi and use it from both topi/relay. \r\n\r\nSecond, currently there are 4 `te::compute` for `strided_slice`, each with slightly different expectation on its input and input param canonicalization. \r\n* https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/include/tvm/topi/transform.h#L716-L726\r\n* https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/include/tvm/topi/transform.h#L628-L636\r\n* https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/include/tvm/topi/transform.h#L579-L593\r\n* https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/src/relay/op/tensor/transform.cc#L2710-L2720\r\n\r\nI examined each of them in detail and decided that we only need two `te::compute` to support all cases:\r\n* A static parameter variant, where all input parameters are `Array<Integer>`. Input shape can be partially dynamic/static. https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/64c1bbf27607de08620c942d41592bae71c0a667/include/tvm/topi/transform.h#L700-L712\r\n* A partially dynamic/static parameter variant, where all input parameters are `Array<PrimExpr>`. https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/64c1bbf27607de08620c942d41592bae71c0a667/include/tvm/topi/transform.h#L594-L608\r\n\r\nIn both cases, static input dimensions are preserved as much as possible. The `axes` is added only to the first variant, according to my use case. \r\n\r\nplease review @tqchen @mbrookhart @kevinthesun @yongwww @comaniac

is in preparation for additional refactoring.  Functions are organized according to group similar functionality together, to minimize the amount of file-to-file transfers needed later.  The main divisions are between VulkanDeviceAPI, VulkanModuleNode/VulkanWrappedFunc, VulkanThreadEntry, and VulkanContext.\r\n\r\nOther than minimal renaming of private functions and the addition of some documenting comments, this commit should have zero changes to the functions definitions themselves, only to their arrangement within the `src/runtime/vulkan` directory.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis rearrangement is in preparation for the following planned changes.  (These changes are **not implemented** in the current PR, but are mentioned here as the motivation for why the functionality is grouped as it is.  Each is intended to be a separate PR following this one, with the file rearrangement done such that each later change will touch the minimum number of files.)\r\n\r\n* New class, VulkanInstance\r\n\r\n  Currently, `VulkanDeviceAPI` constructs the VkInstance in the constructor, then destroys in the destructor.  If an exception is thrown after `vkCreateInstance`, before the end of the constructor, the `VulkanDeviceAPI` destructor and `vkDestroyInstace` is never called.  This can cause segfaults on NV drivers.\r\n\r\n  `VulkanInstance` class to be constructed in `VulkanDeviceAPI`'s constructor.  Last line of `VulkanInstance` constructor calls `vkCreateInstance`, and the destructor calls `vkDestroyInstance`.\r\n\r\n* Rename, `VulkanContext` -> `VulkanDevice`\r\n\r\n  In keeping with the general renaming of `tvm.context` to `tvm.device`, applying the same here.\r\n  \r\n* VulkanDevice, constructor/destructor\r\n  \r\n  In constructor, initialize itself based on a `VkPhysicalDevice`.  In destructor, call `vkDestroyDevice`.  These are pulled out of the `VulkanDeviceAPI` constructor.\r\n  \r\n* VulkanBuffer, constructor/destructor\r\n\r\n  `CreateBuffer` function becomes a method of `VulkanDevice`, returns a buffer object.  Each `VulkanBuffer` object is owned by the `VulkanDevice` that created it.  The `VulkanBuffer` objects can be moved, but not copied, so a `VulkanBuffer*` can still be returned by `AllocDataSpace`.  The `VulkanBuffer` calls `vkDestroyBuffer` and `vkFreeMemory` in its destructor.\r\n  \r\n* Remove maps from VulkanThreadEntry\r\n\r\n  Some device-specific parameters are stored in `VulkanDevice`, while others are stored in `VulkanThreadEntry`.  This would move all device-specific parameters into a single location.  The `VulkanDevice` would hold a `ThreadLocalStore` with a `VulkanStream`, `VulkanStagingBuffer`, and `VulkanUnformBuffer` in order to maintain separate per-device parameters.\r\n\r\n  The active device and the `WorkspacePool` would remain with the `VulkanThreadEntry`, since these are not device-specific.\r\n\r\n* Unify `Launch` and `LaunchDeferred`\r\n\r\n  As far as I can tell, the reason to have `LaunchDeferred` is to prevent multiple kernels that have the same descriptor set from submitted to the GPU at the same time.  `Launch` is allowed to push to the command buffer without any checks.  This requires the calling scope to know many internals of the `VulkanStream`, such as knowing that the deferred_initializer should only ever set descriptor sets.\r\n\r\n  Instead, having `VulkanStream::Launch` accept an argument of which descriptors are needed (the `std::vector<VkDescriptorBufferInfo>`). This pulls most of the UseImmediate-specific logic into a single place.\r\n\r\n  Also, at this point, rename `UseImmediate` to `UsePushDescriptors`. `UseImmediate` suggests that the mode is similar to immediate mode of OpenGL or Direct2D, which is not the case.  Whether or not push descriptors are used, the command buffer isn't submitted to the GPU until the `vkQueueSubmit` call in `VulkanStream::Synchronize`.\r\n  \r\n* Track uniform buffer bytes in the VulkanStream\r\n\r\n  Along with the descriptor sets, the uniform buffer space is also shared between all kernels simultaneously submitted to the GPU and using the same the uniform buffer.  In the current implementation, if two consecutive functions each require UBO for scalar inputs, the second one will overwrite the values of the first.\r\n  \r\n  Instead, we should allocate the maximum uniform buffer range allowed on a GPU, then maintain a count of how many bytes are in use. Similar to how the current `LaunchDeferred` implementation handles conflicting descriptor sets, if a new kernel cannot be submitted without overflowing the range available, make a call to `Synchronize`.\r\n  \r\n* Move `VulkanPipeline` cleanup to destructor\r\n\r\n  Currently in `VulkanModuleNode` destructor, would be implemented in `VulkanPipeline` destructor instead.\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-28T00:04:31Z","updated_at":"2021-06-01T15:07:52Z","closed_at":"2021-05-29T00:53:44Z","merged_at":"2021-05-29T00:53:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"0e73035176473caa1c35a1ac687d8a843bd617e0","assignee":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8157/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8157/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8157/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/e829625ff72d3c3f84a4ace1af2a711373c3f0c9","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:vulkan_cc_refactor","ref":"vulkan_cc_refactor","sha":"e829625ff72d3c3f84a4ace1af2a711373c3f0c9","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

been a long-known issue where sometimes during alter_op_layout, the source IRModule is mutated. Sometimes this can cause errors during task extraction. One example model where the issue pops up is [yolov3-tiny](https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/vision/object_detection_segmentation/tiny-yolov3). An easy workaround to avoid this bug is making a copy of the input module before applying optimization passes. This PR adds a copy step to both autotvm and auto_scheduler. I'm not sure what tests to add since the bug is extremely difficult to pin down. It does trigger with the above linked yolo model though.\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-26T21:29:05Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T15:54:53Z","closed_at":"2021-05-30T03:07:04Z","merged_at":"2021-05-30T03:07:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"e26990fa49cbd57abb115d5362c66e9c445db407","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8143/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8143/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8143/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/2703705307dc1fd0b65963aafd6ac3a67ae6ccf1","head":{"label":"jwfromm:avoid_alter_op_bug","ref":"avoid_alter_op_bug","sha":"2703705307dc1fd0b65963aafd6ac3a67ae6ccf1","user":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185874049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU4NzQwNDk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"jwfromm/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm/tvm","description":"Open

PR introduces a new parser `tensorflow2.py`. To keep the code separate from original parser code and introduce TF2 related changes, much of the existing code is ported into this frontend code. This commit follows the original plan of commits as proposed to support TF2 frontend in relay here: https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4102. Exact commit plan [here](https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/4102#issuecomment-784456088).\r\n\r\nSome important points on introducing the TF2 frontend:\r\n\r\n1. All of the existing ops as available in `tensorflow.py` has been reused. \r\n2. Support for ops like `PartitionedCall`, `StatelessPartitionedCall` invoked as functional nodes.\r\n3. The control flow logic in TF1 is not used, and in that high level control flow structures like `If`, `While`, `StatelessWhile` has been introduced which are invoked as functional node.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome points in testing:\r\n\r\n1. All of the unit tests available in ` tests/python/frontend/tensorflow2/` were used in evaluating the new parser. Previous unit tests cover the support for ops like `Add2D`, `Relu` etc. in `test_functional.py` and some small end-to-end models in `test_sequential.py`.\r\n2. Additional tests to test the control flow structures have been introduced in this PR in `test_functional.py` for ops like `If`, `While` and `StatelessWhile`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: David Huang <davhuan@amazon.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Rohan Mukherjee <mukrohan@amazon.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Srinidhi Goud <srinidhi.goud29@gmail.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Xingyu Zhou <zhoxingy@amazon.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Xiao <weix@amazon.com>\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

end-to-end goal of this PR is to be able to specify all vulkan capabilities in the Target, initialize vulkan such that we can legally use those capabilities, then pass the device description to the SPIRVSupport struct.  This is broken down into the following subchanges, each of which is implemented in a separate commit for readability.\r\n\r\n- Enable instance/device extensions.  Vulkan requires that extensions be explicitly enabled if used.  Has explicitly list out which extensions are required (currently none) and which are optional.\r\n\r\n- Extract device information using `vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties` and `vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures`, determine which Vulkan capabilities are supported, pack into a Target.\r\n\r\n- Query instance-supported apiVersion before creating instance. Vulkan requires no functions beyond the specified apiVersion be used.\r\n\r\n- Query support for dedicated allocation and push descriptors along with the rest of the device support.  Move the options to disable their use from compile-time variables to environment variables `TVM_VULKAN_DISABLE_PUSH_DESCRIPTOR` and `TVM_VULKAN_DISABLE_DEDICATED_ALLOCATION`.\r\n\r\n- Move option for vulkan validation layers to environment variable, to enable faster use as a debug tool.  If `TVM_VULKAN_ENABLE_VALIDATION_LAYERS` is a non-empty string, validation layers will be enabled.\r\n\r\n- Explicitly enable vulkan features in device creation.  Vulkan requires that features be explicitly enabled before use.  For each feature that the device supports and a shader might use, declare it in the call to `vkCreateDevice`.\r\n\r\n- Avoid repeated queries for device attributes, implementing `VulkanDeviceAPI::GetAttr` based on the per-device values stored in the Target.  This pulls all logic for querying device parameters is in a single location.\r\n\r\n- Implement \"from_device\" flag for the vulkan target.  With the number of device capabilities that may or may not be supported by a vulkan driver, it can be tedious to input them.  Specifying \"-from_device=0\" now indicates that any unspecified values should be read from the device.\r\n\r\n- Read vulkan device capabilities/limits from Target.  Previously, the codegen assumed that all device features were present.  Now, the codegen reads device capabilities from the Target, and throws an error if codegen would require use of an unsupported feature.\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-25T17:55:56Z","updated_at":"2021-05-29T00:24:14Z","closed_at":"2021-05-26T14:50:24Z","merged_at":"2021-05-26T14:50:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"c02cafb6570aadab4d101a6737ad23bc996cbe2d","assignee":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8127/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8127/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8127/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/1d262d7545c76f05dd6a29337919cb28d83f26dc","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:vulkan_target_query","ref":"vulkan_target_query","sha":"1d262d7545c76f05dd6a29337919cb28d83f26dc","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

we discovered that tf2onnx is exporting some int8 graphs as fake quantized/QAT models in ONNX, i.e, int8 ops are exported as dequantize->op->quantize. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a pass to convert those graphs into direct int8 ops inside relay. I've tested correctness of the resulting models on Inceptionv1 and ssd-mobilenet-v1 from the tensorflow lite model zoo imported via ONNX. Follow up work will analyze further models for more operations to include in this pass. \r\n\r\ncc @AndrewZhaoLuo @masahi @jwfromm
