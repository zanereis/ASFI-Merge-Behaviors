But since bound check\r\ndoes div, which by default rounds to zero, we get zero.\r\nThis diff fixes this for const int bounds when before division it is\r\nknowns that divisor and dividend are constants and if so it does\r\nfloordiv, instead of div. This seems ok for condition on iteration\r\nvariables, however not clear if it should do floordiv everywhere else.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-18T00:19:02Z","updated_at":"2019-11-15T03:49:27Z","closed_at":"2019-11-15T03:49:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"16df0b2d16b555e97fb7e4256dab4dc19188c696","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/3966/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/3966/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3966/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/4c9b9184e99e8f5c2ba25c93741b516de47fe91c","head":{"label":"kimishpatel:const_loop_partition_fix","ref":"const_loop_partition_fix","sha":"4c9b9184e99e8f5c2ba25c93741b516de47fe91c","user":{"login":"kimishpatel","id":17488981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDg4OTgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17488981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimishpatel","html_url":"https://github.com/kimishpatel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimishpatel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimishpatel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimishpatel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimishpatel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimishpatel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimishpatel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimishpatel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimishpatel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimishpatel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206179183,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDYxNzkxODM=","name":"tvm-1","full_name":"kimishpatel/tvm-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kimishpatel","id":17488981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDg4OTgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17488981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimishpatel","html_url":"https://github.com/kimishpatel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimishpatel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimishpatel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimishpatel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimishpatel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimishpatel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimishpatel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimishpatel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimishpatel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimishpatel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kimishpatel/tvm-1","description":"Open

is a requirement in the parsing of pre-quantized mxnet model where; an attribute's value depends on another attribute being present or absent. The example can be found here\r\n1. https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/quantization/quantize_v2.cc#L87-L90\r\n2. https://t.ly/AKMLm\r\n\r\nSince there is no way for querying if an attribute is present or not in a very clean way possible I am adding a new method to check if an attribute is present.\r\n\r\nSince the attribute in question is a float passing in a NAN or something equivalent is not right since i NAN could be a legal value of something gone wrong during quantization.\r\nAnother way could be to pass a String instead as a default value, but that will not be a clean solution since we have a api which is supposed to return a float is returning a string instead.","created_at":"2019-09-14T03:57:24Z","updated_at":"2019-09-17T23:39:44Z","closed_at":"2019-09-17T23:39:35Z","merged_at":"2019-09-17T23:39:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"fc071daf4b7426ea17a8461c0887a478317f58a0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

auto_broadcast of buffer may cause a problem when it hoists the `if` guard, as the lifted expression may use the arg before it is defined through let binding.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following code will cause problems during codege, because we will have something like `if (o1/x == 1) ... ` because `o1` and `x` are bound.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    n0, m0, x = tvm.var('n0'), tvm.var('m0'), tvm.var('x')\r\n    n1, m1 = tvm.var('n1'), tvm.var('m1')\r\n    o0, o1 = tvm.var('o0'), tvm.var('o1')\r\n\r\n    A = tvm.placeholder((m0, n0), name='A')\r\n    B = tvm.placeholder((m1, n1), name='B')\r\n    C = tvm.compute((o0, o1/x), lambda i, j: A[i, j] + B[i, j], name='C')\r\n\r\n    Ab = tvm.decl_buffer(A.shape, A.dtype, name=\"Ab\", buffer_type=\"auto_broadcast\")\r\n    Bb = tvm.decl_buffer(B.shape, B.dtype, name=\"Bb\", buffer_type=\"auto_broadcast\")\r\n    Cc = tvm.decl_buffer(C.shape, C.dtype, name=\"Cc\", buffer_type=\"auto_broadcast\")\r\n    s = tvm.create_schedule(C.op)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fix hoist the let binding before the uses of the assert/if statements.\r\n\r\nAnother problem we might need to solve is the the current input arg can only be a single variable instead of an expression, i.e. `A = tvm.placeholder((m/x, n), name='A')` would fail, @yzhliu has also observed this. We can probably solve this in a follow-up PR. This PR will feed all these args directly in the build statement so that they can be correctly bound.\r\n\r\nCC @yzhliu, @icemelon9, @tqchen

PR enhances the tuning space of split scheduling primitive. Originally, it only has two policies: \"all\" for all divisible factors of the dimension length; \"candidate\" for manual entities. The issue is that for irregualr shape like prime numbers or product of prime numbers (e.g., 229x229 in Inception V3), the \"all\" policy has less opportunities to achieve a better performance.\r\n\r\nIn this change, split now has four policies:\r\n- \"factors\" for the origianl \"all\".\r\n- \"power2\" for all less or equal power-of-two numbers.\r\n- \"verbose\" for the union of \"factors\" and \"power2\".\r\n- \"candidate\" for the original \"candidate\".\r\n\r\nNote that we will still use \"factors\" policy as the default one so merging this PR will _not_ change performance of TOPI ops at all, but users can have an option to search more values as they want, and this could benefit to the follow-up dynamic shape implementation.\r\n\r\nI use Inception V3 to illustrate the benefit of using \"power2\" policy. Here is the result of 44 tasks  of Inception V3 tuned with \"factors\" (default) and \"power2\" on AWS EC2 c5.9xlarge. For each task, the n_trial is set to 100 and minimum repeat ms is set to 1000. In summary, **22/44** tasks achieve better performance with \"power2\" policy, and the average speedup over \"factors\" is 1.03. Note that the speedup is more obvious in later layers which have more irregular shapes.\r\n\r\n| Orig (GFlop/s)    | Power2 (GFlop/s)  | Speedup |\r\n|---------|---------|---------|\r\n| 563.39  |

PR improves conv2d_transpose schedule on X86 and CUDA, and as a result accelerates mask-rcnn inference.\r\n\r\n## Optimization\r\n#### X86\r\nWe reuse fully optimized conv2d schedule for conv2d_transpose, with a slight modification to parallelize across batches to make large-batch cases faster.\r\n\r\n#### CUDA\r\nA fallback schedule is added.\r\n\r\n## Results\r\nThe mask-rcnn model has resnet-50 as backbone. It has one conv2d_transpose layer with input size = (1000, 2048, 7, 7), output channels = 256, strides = (2, 2), kernel = (2, 2).\r\n\r\n#### X86\r\nBelow are results tested on c5.x18large using 36 threads\r\n- GluonCV time for mask-rcnn as baseline, with MKL: **4.5** sec\r\n- Before optimization, TVM time of mask-rcnn: **17.6** sec\r\n- Before optimization, TVM time of conv2d_transpose: **15.2** sec\r\n- After optimization, TVM time of mask-rcnn: **3.2** sec\r\n- After optimization, TVM time of conv2d_transpose: **0.5** sec\r\n\r\nAfter optimization, TVM is faster than GluonCV with MKL.\r\n\r\n#### CUDA\r\nBelow are results tested on p3.8xlarge using a Tesla V100 GPU\r\n- GluonCV time for mask-rcnn as baseline, with cudnn 7.3.1: **0.36** sec\r\n- Before optimization, TVM time of mask-rcnn: **16.37** sec\r\n- Before optimization, TVM time of conv2d_transpose: **14.21** sec\r\n- After optimization, TVM time of mask-rcnn: **2.27** sec\r\n- After optimization, TVM time of conv2d_transpose: **0.12** sec\r\n\r\nAfter optimization, conv2d_transpose is significantly accelerated, however, the end-to-end time of mask-rcnn in TVM is still much slower than GluonCV. If we inspect the [analysis report](https://gist.github.com/Huyuwei/24d4a5465452803bf38f420d71fb9049) generated by TVM debugger, we will find that argsort and non_max_suppression ops are becoming the

change fixes a bug when passing tvm::Integer to [strided_slice](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/topi/include/topi/transform.h#L492), using int64_t. \r\n\r\nThe bug is that when end is INT64_MAX, in tvm::Integer it becomes -1. This resulted in the sliced shape to be 1 off in that dimension. For example, with input dim of 100, slice end being INT32_MAX would return output dim of 100, while slice end being INT64_MAX returns output dim of 99.\r\n\r\nClamping int64_t inputs to the range of int32_t fixed the issue. It is arguable whether the clamp should happen silently or throw error when input is outside of int32_t range, or even upgrade tvm::Integer to be based on int64_t entirely. However, the silent overflow to -1 is wrong and needs to be fixed anyway IMO.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-12T19:40:26Z","updated_at":"2020-01-30T18:46:44Z","closed_at":"2019-09-20T21:25:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e748d43ace3840d89df35e3e96b6b0e2e375521f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":961828004,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NjE4MjgwMDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20update","name":"status:

Discussion post](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/keras-import-dimensions-dont-match-in-3-layer-example/3974) found two bugs in Relay. The first was a silly mistake I introduced with the Resize rework (#3788 ) caused by defaulting to the wrong layout for upsample in the Keras frontend. I've resolved this issue and fixed the corresponding test. The second bug occurs when a convolution with 1 filter attempts to determine the shape of its weights. Relay checks for group convolutions by seeing if the number of channels equals the group size, however we obviously shouldn't if the number of channels is 1. I've added a new test to check for this failure in the future.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-11T20:59:39Z","updated_at":"2020-01-11T22:54:30Z","closed_at":"2019-09-18T07:40:31Z","merged_at":"2019-09-18T07:40:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"de123760be3e022da680ebd8f59fbf2fc768f9a3","assignee":{"login":"kazum","id":812126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjEyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum","html_url":"https://github.com/kazum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kazum","id":812126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjEyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum","html_url":"https://github.com/kazum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

please review this PR that adds scheduling for dense OP on CUDA since the original scheduling was too basic to achieve reasonable performance.\r\n\r\nThe added scheduling was modified from topi/recipe/gemm/cuda_gemm_square.py to achieve high performance (6TFlop/s for 2048x2048 dense matrix after AutoTVM tuning). For small batch (<64) dense, we are still based on the original scheduling but just added a parameter (tile_k) for AutoTVM to tune (~370 GFlop/s for batch size 1 dense computation).\r\n\r\nOne reason to have separate scheduling for different batch size is that I encountered invalid CUDA kernel errors when applying the high performance scheduling to small batch. I think that may be due to invalid splits, but I am not quite sure. You are welcome to comment and suggest improvements.","created_at":"2019-09-09T17:15:34Z","updated_at":"2019-09-19T21:24:21Z","closed_at":"2019-09-19T21:23:20Z","merged_at":"2019-09-19T21:23:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"bec08fecf5db8f1b2f36dd8b944a5084a2b72798","assignee":{"login":"Huyuwei","id":17470319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDcwMzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17470319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei","html_url":"https://github.com/Huyuwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Huyuwei","id":17470319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDcwMzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17470319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei","html_url":"https://github.com/Huyuwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/3923/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/3923/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3923/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/f934a48e044d3307a5e75a93fa889e25f5a48f35","head":{"label":"comaniac:dense_cuda_schedule","ref":"dense_cuda_schedule","sha":"f934a48e044d3307a5e75a93fa889e25f5a48f35","user":{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":202586405,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDI1ODY0MDU=","name":"tvm","full_name":"comaniac/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac/tvm","description":"Open

an idempotent import mechanism for Relay and restructures some of the code around handling Relay files. One of the challenges for introducing new dialects of Relay as I was doing in #3560 is the ability to define new external types, and operations over them. \r\n\r\nIn order to track new types such as `Storage` we need the ability to share chunks of code in a idempotent way. The current module design is lacking in this regard and the import mechanism addresses this. \r\n\r\nAn example of where this fails now is if we introduce new builtin types, where do we place the code to install them in a module? for example if we use the instantiate the prelude more than once we will receive an error right now. \r\n\r\nThis is required for my memory analysis PR which is upcoming, and depends on @weberlo's parser PR.\r\n\r\n@weberlo will follow up by moving the entire Prelude to the text format. \r\n\r\nThis PR also cleans up InferType's handling of modules which is currently sub-optimal.

PR tackles some of item 0 from [this issue](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/3584), using [this RFC](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/3016) as a reference.\r\n\r\nOne notable deviation is that `match` expressions can be specified as incomplete (i.e., not requiring all cases to be covered) by writing `match?`.\r\n\r\nThe tests in `test_ir_parser.py` currently do not pass if I don't inline every expression in the pretty printer.  This is because when graph vars are created, scoping becomes more complicated.  For example, the following program\r\n```\r\ndef @length[A](%xs: List[A]) -> int32 {\r\n    match? (%xs) {\r\n    | Cons(_, %rest) => 1 + @length(%rest)\r\n    | Nil => 0\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwould be pretty-printed like so\r\n```\r\ndef @length[A](%xs: List[A]) -> int32 {\r\n    %0 = 1 + @length(%rest)\r\n    match? (%xs) {\r\n    | Cons(_, %rest) => %0\r\n    | Nil => 0\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n.  While this can still be parsed (by delaying evaluation of the graph expr until the context of its usage is available), it seems to add additional complexity without any benefits that I'm aware of.  It also makes testing equality with the original program more difficult.\r\n\r\nHopefully, this brings us closer, if not all the way there, to writing Relay's prelude in the text format.\r\n\r\nCC

The benefits include:\r\n* Enable NHWC schedule directly. Previously, we need to transpose between NCHW and NHWC.\r\n* AutoTVM now can tune NHWC directly. Previously, we need to build a NCHW network to tune.\r\n* Potential performance advantage in NHWC which known to community.\r\n\r\nCowork with @FrozenGene and @etaf .\r\n\r\nThis is a **draft** to loop people who may have interest, @anijain2305 @tmoreau89 .

is a debug function to force instructions\r\nto be serialize instead of parrallel running, by doing so we\r\ncan isolate some parallel problem or do performance compare\r\nbetween parallel and serialize. But this function have some\r\nproblem, once get enabled by set debug flag, vta would stuck\r\nwhen running on pynq board.\r\n\r\nReproduce:\r\nset vta.build_config(debug_flag=32), then run vta resnet on FPGA, issue would reproduce.\r\n\r\nAnalysis:\r\nonce enable RewriteForceSerial, the dependency logic is different\r\nwith default one, but we still use same logic to generate FINISH\r\nand other logic, this would cause dead lock.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\ngive a different dependency settings when enable

the Vulkan API, it is recommended to launch multiple compute kernels on a shared command buffer in general, instead of having a 1-1 relationship between compute kernels and buffers. See http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2016/events/vulkanday/High_Performance_Vulkan.pdf, https://devblogs.nvidia.com/vulkan-dos-donts/, etc. The extant TVM Vulkan runtime uses one command buffer per kernel, which can lead to significant overheads for smaller-kernels (on the order of half a millisecond on some of the devices I looked at).\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach leverages an approach similar to a CUDA stream abstraction, where we record commands onto the command buffer, and at synchronization points, submit the command buffer to the queue and wait on the fence. This is non-trivially more efficient - similar to the approach taken by [`ncnn`](https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn/tree/master/src/layer/vulkan/) - there are some useful ideas in there that applied here. In particular it's quite convenient to depend on the KHR push descriptors extension, but that could be removed without too much pain similar to how ncnn does it.\r\n\r\nThis code isn't production ready, and it's not super clear how much interest there is in the Vulkan side of things. I think it's quite promising and was planning on spending some time looking at codegen stuff, but the difficulty in getting reasonable numbers for small B/W bound kernels was the motivator in working on this to begin with.\r\n\r\nIf there's interest we could probably figure out a way to merge this into the existing Vulkan runtime, perhaps gated by a feature flag?\r\n\r\nPerformance improves for simple pointwise kernels as expected, using a script like:\r\n\r\n```.py\r\nimport tvm\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\ntx = tvm.thread_axis(\"threadIdx.x\")\r\nbx =

Keras `_convert_reshape` only supports cases where Keras layer input channel and target shape channel are equal.\r\ne.g. ?,4,4,256 -> ?,16,256\r\n\r\nThis PR supports additional cases \r\n1. target shape length is 1\r\n?,2,8 -> ?,16\r\n\r\n2. target shape length is 2 and shape is square, e.g.\r\n?,2,8 -> ?,4,4\r\n?,16 -> ?,4,4\r\n\r\nI use this improvement in Keras `_convert_reshape` to support `Softmax(axis=[1,2])` (global Softmax).\r\nRelay does not support array type for  Softmax axis (e.g. `axis=[1,2]`).

PR adds relay operations for the bitserial operations conv2d, dense and bitpack. This addition allows relay frontends to leverage the already existing TOPI bitserial ops that enable very fast low-bit execution on arm CPU. There are currently some limitations in regards to automatic shape inference in large part due to the need for these ops to support optional prepacking of weight bits. For example, this makes it difficult to infer shape without explicitly knowing the number of channels ahead of time, so here we require that the channels attribute is always set.\r\n\r\nAlso included in this PR is a schedule for NHWC convolution on arm_cpu that yields good results. Because of this inclusion, I've accordingly changed the conv2d legalize routine on arm.","created_at":"2019-08-28T04:03:10Z","updated_at":"2020-01-11T22:54:37Z","closed_at":"2019-09-01T00:51:52Z","merged_at":"2019-09-01T00:51:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"d08c74caf6d0ec0919810ca442861a462e5b81cf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/3844/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/3844/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3844/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/491e4f28b7a965eda9a05a9c2dacd58be1d4b49c","head":{"label":"jwfromm:bitserial_ops","ref":"bitserial_ops","sha":"491e4f28b7a965eda9a05a9c2dacd58be1d4b49c","user":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185874049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU4NzQwNDk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"jwfromm/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm/tvm","description":"Open
