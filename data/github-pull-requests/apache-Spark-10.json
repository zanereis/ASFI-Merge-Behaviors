Both sides (Classic and Connect) maintain their own implementation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo unify the API interface and make `SQLContext` available to Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Connect users are now able to call `sparkSession.sqlContext` and the APIs it provides.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNot needed. All new methods are mirrored from SparkSession except `tables()`, which is covered by existing tests in `ListTablesSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-25T16:50:31Z","updated_at":"2024-12-23T11:21:32Z","closed_at":"2024-12-19T00:03:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"474b41df3af894d40ed345c022d9df72da334792","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"vicennial","id":21010250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDEwMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21010250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial","html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48958/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48958/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48958/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c916a708a207dce34566fed33a8a3ffd9290e8eb","head":{"label":"xupefei:api-sqlcontext","ref":"api-sqlcontext","sha":"c916a708a207dce34566fed33a8a3ffd9290e8eb","user":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":777257207,"node_id":"R_kgDOLlQA9w","name":"spark","full_name":"xupefei/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdding a flag `isCtas` to insert commands in both v1 and v2 APIs to signal whether the insert is part of a CTAS (create table as select) statement or just a standalone insert.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDetermining default collation acts different based on whether the command is DDL or DML, so the insert that is created from a CTAS (which is obviously a DDL statement) should also be treated as a DDL statement. And before this we had no way of knowing this information.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI'm not sure if we can have tests for this in the code as these inserts are created during the execution of CTAS commands and we can't access the commands that are created during their execution.\r\n\r\nHowever, I did test this manually for both v1 and v2 commands and it works as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative

implementation for a pipe method in the PySpark DataFrame. Similar to the transform method, this method can be called directly on a DataFrame to perform custom transformations functions. However, unlike the current transform method which requires one call per custom transformation, pipe can accept an ambiguous number of transformations and chain them together on the user's behalf.\r\n\r\nUsing the existing documentation for `DataFrame.transform`, the suggested pipe method would look like such:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col\r\n\r\n\r\ndf = spark.createDataFrame([(1, 1.0), (2, 2.0)], [\"int\", \"float\"])\r\n\r\ndef cast_all_to_int(input_df):\r\n    return input_df.select([col(col_name).cast(\"int\") for col_name in input_df.columns])\r\n\r\ndef sort_columns_asc(input_df):\r\n    return input_df.select(*sorted(input_df.columns))\r\n\r\n# with transform method\r\ndf.transform(cast_all_to_int).transform(sort_columns_asc).show()\r\n\r\n# with pipe method\r\ndf.pipe(cast_all_to_int, sort_columns_asc)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor functions that take parameters, users can pass closures or partially defined functions.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Callable\r\nimport functools\r\n\r\ndef add_n(input_df, n):\r\n    return input_df.select([(col(col_name) + n).alias(col_name)\r\n                            for col_name in input_df.columns])\r\n\r\n# define a partial function\r\nadd_one = functools.partial(add_n, n=1)\r\n\r\n# or, define a function that returns a closure\r\ndef add_n(n: int) -> Callable:\r\n    def closure(input_df: DataFrame) -> DataFrame:\r\n        return input_df.select([(col(col_name) + n).alias(col_name)\r\n                            for col_name in input_df.columns])\r\n    return closure\r\n\r\n# with transform method\r\ndf.transform(add_n, 1).transform(add_n, n=10).show()\r\n\r\n# with pipe method\r\ndf.pipe(add_one,

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, we use the internal byte representation to store state for stateful streaming operators in the StateStore. This PR introduces Avro serialization and deserialization capabilities in the RocksDBStateEncoder so that we can instead use Avro encoding to store state. This is currently enabled for the TransformWithState operator via SQLConf to support all functionality supported by TWS\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nUnsafeRow is an inherently unstable format that makes no guarantees of being backwards-compatible. Therefore, if the format changes between Spark releases, this could cause StateStore corruptions. Avro is more stable, and inherently enables schema evolution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAmended and added to unit tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a method to sanitize extra JVM options. This prevents command injection vulnerability when using the `spark.executor.extraJavaOptions` configuration parameter\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis pull request addresses an issue where spark.executor.extraJavaOptions could potentially allow the execution of unintended shell commands due to improper sanitization of input parameters. By injecting shell commands into this configuration parameter, such as `touch$IFS/tmp/zzz123`, the command gets executed on the executor. This sanitization ensures that only valid Java options are processed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit Test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-11-23T02:39:48Z","updated_at":"2024-12-15T22:04:51Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d4bf3754f66c526707802b0ab2dcec2726953918","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48941/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48941/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48941/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a2817a7c70c0b346ee3c168fdf0037b43ed65141","head":{"label":"soumasish:jira-spark-50240","ref":"jira-spark-50240","sha":"a2817a7c70c0b346ee3c168fdf0037b43ed65141","user":{"login":"soumasish","id":8686095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODYwOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8686095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish","html_url":"https://github.com/soumasish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":146815011,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDY4MTUwMTE=","name":"spark","full_name":"soumasish/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"soumasish","id":8686095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODYwOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8686095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish","html_url":"https://github.com/soumasish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/soumasish/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds SQL pipe syntax support for SET operator.\r\n\r\nThis operator removes one or more existing column from the input table and replaces each one with a new computed column whose value is equal to evaluating the specified expression.\r\n\r\nThis is equivalent to `SELECT * EXCEPT (name), <newExpressions> AS name` in the SQL compiler. It is provided as a convenience feature and some functionality overlap exists with lateral column aliases.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-- Setting with an expression.\r\nvalues (0, 'pqr', 2), (3, 'tuv', 5) as tab(a, b, c)\r\n|> set c = a + length(b);\r\n\r\n0, 'pqr', 3\r\n3, 'tuv', 6\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe SQL pipe operator syntax will let users compose queries in a more flexible fashion.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a few unit test cases, but mostly relies on golden file test coverage. I did this to make sure the answers are correct as this feature is implemented and also so we can look at the analyzer output plans to ensure they look right as well.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-11-23T00:15:27Z","updated_at":"2024-11-28T05:03:45Z","closed_at":"2024-11-28T03:20:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f8f13eeb6aa67a9de542ff28958e3a2ff4dfda11","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48940/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48940/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48940/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/041727c0f13c336945bbdea7f73237412fe19658","head":{"label":"dtenedor:pipe-syntax-set","ref":"pipe-syntax-set","sha":"041727c0f13c336945bbdea7f73237412fe19658","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":592933002,"node_id":"R_kgDOI1dwig","name":"spark","full_name":"dtenedor/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor/spark","description":"Apache

never been used in Apache Spark code base.\r\n\r\n-

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe last action in [bin/load-spark-env.sh](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d5da49d56d7dec5f8a96c5252384d865f7efd4d9/bin/load-spark-env.sh#L68) performs a test to determine whether running in a terminal or not, and whether `stdin` is reading from a pipe.   A more portable test is needed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe current approach relies on `ps` with options that vary significantly between different Unix-like systems.  Specifically, it prints an error message in both `cygwin` and `msys2` (and by extension, in all of the variations of `git-for-windows`).   It doesn't print an error message, but fails to detect a terminal session in `Linux` and `Osx/Darwin homebrew` (always thinks STDIN is a pipe).\r\n\r\nHere's what the problem looks like in a `cygwin64` session (with `set -x` just ahead of the section of interest):\r\n\r\nIf called directly:\r\n```bash\r\n$ bin/load-spark-env.sh\r\n++ ps -o stat= -p 1947\r\nps: unknown option -- o\r\nTry `ps --help' for more information.\r\n+ [[ ! '' =~ \\+ ]]\r\n+ [[ -p /dev/stdin ]]\r\n+ export 'SPARK_BEELINE_OPTS= -Djline.terminal=jline.UnsupportedTerminal'\r\n+ SPARK_BEELINE_OPTS=' -Djline.terminal=jline.UnsupportedTerminal'\r\n```\r\nInterestingly, due to the 2-part test, it does the right thing w.r.t. the Terminal test, the main problem being the error message.\r\nIf called downstream from a pipe:\r\n```bash\r\n$ echo \"yo\" | bin/load-spark-env.sh\r\n++ ps -o stat= -p 1955\r\nps: unknown option -- o\r\nTry `ps --help' for more information.\r\n+ [[ ! '' =~ \\+ ]]\r\n+ [[ -p /dev/stdin ]]\r\n```\r\nAgain, it correctly detects the pipe environment, but with an error message.\r\n\r\nIn WSL2 Ubuntu, the test doesn't correctly detect a non-pipe terminal session:\r\n```bash\r\n# /opt/spark$ bin/load-spark-env.sh\r\n++ ps -o stat= -p 1423\r\n+ [[ ! S+ =~ \\+ ]]\r\n# echo \"yo!\" | bin/load-spark-env.sh\r\n++ ps -o stat= -p 1416\r\n+ [[ ! S+ =~ \\+ ]]\r\n```\r\nIn `#134-Ubuntu SMP Fri Sep 27 20:20:17 UTC 2024`, the same failure occurs (it doesn't recognize terminal environments).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis is a proposed bug fix, and, other than fixing the bug,  should be invisible to users.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe patch was verified to behave as intended in terminal sessions, both interactive and piped, in the following 5 environments.\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Linux quadd 5.15.0-124-generic #134-Ubuntu SMP Fri Sep 27 20:20:17 UTC 2024 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n-

sessions.\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\nif [ -e /usr/bin/tty -a \"`tty`\" != \"not a tty\" -a ! -p /dev/stdin ]; then\r\n  echo \"not a pipe\"\r\nelse\r\n  echo \"is a pipe\"\r\nfi\r\n```\r\nThe output

This annotation propagates upward through the expression tree. Once the root of the expression is reached, the annotations are removed, and the expression is cast to the desired data type.\r\n\r\nFor the root expression `e`, the collation data type context is computed by first calculating the context for all its children and then merging those results into the data type of `e`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn #48663, a new approach to calculating collation precedence was introduced. This approach recursively examines the children of an expression and propagates the collation with the highest priority upward.\r\n\r\nHowever, the current implementation of collation coercion is limited to determining the StringType that all children should be cast to. This approach falls short when dealing with complex types like structs, maps, and arrays, which can also contain collations. To address this limitation, we need a more general mechanism that allows coercion of any data type, not just simple strings.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nWith new unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that the Artifact Manager is using a malformed URI string for Class Dir in windows. The issue is caused by using a platform-specific `File.separator` instead of `/`: Windows's file separator is `\\`, which results in a wrong URI string:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.net.URISyntaxException: Illegal character in path at index 88:\r\nspark://xxxx:57839/artifacts\\bd3e1ffe-50d2-412c-8fe4-911ae160c251\\classes\\\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis failure is captured by the scheduled Windows build on `master`, such as https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/11958030827.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue we just make sure that the separator is always `/` on all OSes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFix a compilation failure in Windows.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested on my own fork with a modified Workflow that runs on PR: https://github.com/xupefei/spark/pull/1, https://github.com/xupefei/spark/actions/runs/11970330735/job/33372836765?pr=1\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-22T13:37:54Z","updated_at":"2024-11-25T08:51:25Z","closed_at":"2024-11-24T23:49:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"07b110e404a1c34c9147dbc749af8a05ce37d5f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48934/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48934/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48934/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/16454c24ab6be41bc7848047aa8a6c2fc623789c","head":{"label":"xupefei:repl-class-uri-windows","ref":"repl-class-uri-windows","sha":"16454c24ab6be41bc7848047aa8a6c2fc623789c","user":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":777257207,"node_id":"R_kgDOLlQA9w","name":"spark","full_name":"xupefei/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere are 8 Java 21-related golden files in Spark:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/results/try_arithmetic.sql.out.java21\r\n./sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/results/postgreSQL/int8.sql.out.java21\r\n./sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/results/postgreSQL/float4.sql.out.java21\r\n./sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/results/postgreSQL/numeric.sql.out.java21\r\n./sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/results/nonansi/try_arithmetic.sql.out.java21\r\n./sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/results/nonansi/try_aggregates.sql.out.java21\r\n./sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/results/try_aggregates.sql.out.java21\r\n./sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/results/datetime-formatting.sql.out.java21\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter SPARK-50313 was merged, the contents of `./sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/results/try_arithmetic.sql.out.java21` and `./sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/results/try_arithmetic.sql.out` have become identical. We can verify by running `diff ./sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/results/try_arithmetic.sql.out.java21 ./sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/results/try_arithmetic.sql.out`. So this pr deletes this file.\r\n\r\nActually, after SPARK-50313 the specialization for Java 21 has become `./sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/results/nonansi/try_arithmetic.sql.out.java21`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDelete an unnecessary golen file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass Github Actions\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-11-22T02:35:50Z","updated_at":"2024-11-22T05:45:16Z","closed_at":"2024-11-22T05:03:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"95de3a4b875fbec2e5e76fd19efb850455652fd3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48928/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48928/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48928/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ea5c20dc1da56f8f145900bf31671e58bbc01d57","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:SPARK-50389","ref":"SPARK-50389","sha":"ea5c20dc1da56f8f145900bf31671e58bbc01d57","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

However, `SparkException`' s `cause` property may come as `null` by missing actual cause which is `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` in following example. `Actual cause info` is also useful to propagate `Throwable.getCause / getCause.*` properties to clients. Repro test case has been added.\r\n\r\n**Before Fix:**\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.util.SparkFatalException: org.apache.spark.SparkException: Not enough memory to build and broadcast the table to all worker nodes.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support [JEP-444: Virtual Threads](https://openjdk.org/jeps/444) in REST Submission API for Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n- https://openjdk.org/jeps/425: Virtual Threads (Preview) in Java 19\r\n- https://openjdk.org/jeps/436: Virtual Threads (Second Preview) in Java 20\r\n- https://openjdk.org/jeps/444: Virtual Threads in Java 21\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`Virtual Threads` becomes an official feature in Java 21. \r\n- https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/core/virtual-threads.html\r\n> Virtual threads are lightweight threads that reduce the effort of writing, maintaining, and debugging high-throughput concurrent applications.\r\n\r\nIn addition, `Jetty 11` supports `Virtual Threads`.\r\n- https://jetty.org/docs/jetty/11/programming-guide/arch/threads.html#thread-pool-virtual-threads\r\n\r\nWe had better provide a way to use it via a new option `spark.master.rest.virtualThread.enabled`, which is enabled in Java 21 runtime. Please note that this aims for high-throughput concurrency.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-11-21T18:19:22Z","updated_at":"2024-11-22T01:32:26Z","closed_at":"2024-11-22T01:32:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ecfa36820c4d96c2bc697a523808fab676bb98af","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48923/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48923/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48923/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d7f6dc77b7e16e351e4ed5932250300adf4e090d","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-50383","ref":"SPARK-50383","sha":"d7f6dc77b7e16e351e4ed5932250300adf4e090d","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that some of DataFrame execution paths would not process `ObservedMetrics`. The fix is done by injecting a lazy processing logic into the result iterator.\r\n\r\nThe following private execution APIs are affected by this issue:\r\n\r\n- `SparkSession.execute(proto.Relation.Builder)`\r\n- `SparkSession.execute(proto.Command)`\r\n- `SparkSession.execute(proto.Plan)`\r\n\r\nThe following user-facing API is affected by this issue:\r\n- `DataFrame.write.format(\"...\").mode(\"...\").save()`\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes an issue in which on the Server side, two observed metrics can be assigned to the same Plan ID when they are in the same plan (e.g., one observation is used as the input of another). The fix is to traverse the plan and find all observations with correct IDs.\r\n\r\nAnother bug is discovered as a byproduct of introducing a new test case. Copying the PR comment here from SparkConnectPlanner.scala:\r\n\r\n> This fixes a bug where the input of a `CollectMetrics` can be processed two times, once in Line 1190 and once here/below.\r\n> \r\n> When the `input` contains another `CollectMetrics`, transforming it twice will cause two `Observation` objects (in the input) to be initialised and registered two times to the system. Since only one of them will be fulfilled when the query finishes, the one we'll be looking at may not have any data.\r\n> \r\n> This issue is highlighted in the test case `Observation.get is blocked until the query is finished ...`, where we specifically execute `observedObservedDf`, which is a `CollectMetrics` that has another `CollectMetrics` as its input.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes a long-standing issue in `ReorderAssociativeOperator`. In this rule, we flatten the Add/Multiply nodes, and combine the foldable operands into a single Add/Multiply, then evaluate it into a literal. This is fine normally, but we added a new contract in `ConstantFolding` with https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36468 , due to the introduction of ANSI mode and we don't want to fail eagerly for expressions within conditional branches. `ReorderAssociativeOperator` does not follow this contract.\r\n\r\nThe solution in this PR is to leave the expression evaluation to `ConstantFolding`. `ReorderAssociativeOperator` should only match literals. This makes sure that the early expression evaluation follows all the contracts in `ConstantFolding`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAvoid failing the query which should not fail. This also fixes a regression caused by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48395 , which does not introduce the bug, but makes the bug more likely to happen.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, failed queries can run now.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe want to implement a function df.argument(), which returns a Column object as a table arument. This Column can then be passed as input to call a User-Defined Table Function (UDTF) for example.\r\n\r\nThe PR targets at Spark Classic only.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo reach parity with SQL functionality, specifically, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41750.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> @udtf(returnType=\"a: int\")\r\n... class TestUDTF:\r\n...     def eval(self, row: Row):\r\n...         if row[0] > 5:\r\n...             yield row[0],\r\n... \r\n>>> df.argument()\r\nColumn<'functiontablesubqueryargumentexpression()'>\r\n>>> TestUDTF(df.argument()).show()\r\n+---+                                                                           \r\n|  a|\r\n+---+\r\n|  6|\r\n|  7|\r\n+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-21T06:25:54Z","updated_at":"2024-12-03T07:39:57Z","closed_at":"2024-12-03T07:39:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1aafbf6010b0d8c3fe580d55adb66fb15dab6a3b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48914/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48914/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48914/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/36eb838ac797aa4d48d4d22d7e0bcec3b1f72881","head":{"label":"xinrong-meng:df_argument","ref":"df_argument","sha":"36eb838ac797aa4d48d4d22d7e0bcec3b1f72881","user":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335786381,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3ODYzODE=","name":"spark","full_name":"xinrong-meng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng/spark","description":"Apache

If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is to fix a regression caused by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47143 . The problem is, in some places, we want to get a constant from a foldable expression before the query execution starts. https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47143 brings two problems:\r\n1. `UnaryPositive` is no longer a `UnaryExpression`, which means it's not foldable anymore even if its child is foldable.\r\n2. `UnaryPositive` is no longer evaluable.\r\n\r\n`Lag` is such a place. It may evaluate the `inputOffset` parameter eagerly. `lag(..., +1)` no longer works after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47143 .\r\n\r\nInstead of fixing `Lag`, this PR makes two changes and hopefully we can avoid all similar problems:\r\n1. Make `UnaryPositive` extend `UnaryExpression` again. We need follow-up PRs to check other `RuntimeReplaceable` expressions and see if they should extend `UnaryExpression` or `BinaryExpression`, etc.\r\n2. Implement `RuntimeReplaceable#eval` so that we can evaluate folding `RuntimeReplaceable` eagerly when needed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  4. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix the regression on `lag` and avoid similar issues in the future.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, the regression is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, Variant columns could be used with set operations like `DISTINCT`, `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT`. This PR prohibits this behavior since Variant is not orderable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nVariant equality is not defined, and therefore, these operations are also undefined.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, users will now no longer be able to perform set operations on variant columns.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe root cause of this issue is the planner turns `Limit` + `Sort` into `TakeOrderedAndProjectExec` which adds an additional `Project` that does not exist in the logical plan. We shouldn't use this additional `Project` to optimize out other `Project`s, otherwise when AQE turns physical plan back to logical plan, we lose the `Project` and may mess up the output column order.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes it does not remove redundant projects if AEQ is enabled and projectList is the same as child output in `TakeOrderedAndProjectExec`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFix potential data issue and avoid Spark Driver crash:\r\n```\r\n# more hs_err_pid193136.log\r\n#\r\n# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:\r\n#\r\n#  SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x00007f9d14841bc0, pid=193136, tid=223205\r\n#\r\n# JRE version: OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu17.36+18-SA (17.0.4.1+1) (build 17.0.4.1+1-LTS)\r\n# Java VM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu17.36+18-SA (17.0.4.1+1-LTS, mixed mode, sharing, tiered, compressed class ptrs, g1 gc, linux-amd64)\r\n# Problematic frame:\r\n# v  ~StubRoutines::jint_disjoint_arraycopy_avx3\r\n#\r\n# Core dump will be written.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the implementation of user-provided tags to be thread-local, so that tags added by two threads to the same SparkSession do not interfere with each other.\r\n\r\nOverlaps (from the `SparkContext` perspective) are avoided by introducing a thread-local random UUID which is attached to all tags in the same thread.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make tags isolated per thread.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, user-provided tags are now isolated on the session level.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nLocal test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-11-20T11:33:40Z","updated_at":"2024-11-22T00:23:38Z","closed_at":"2024-11-22T00:23:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d6f139607dd66128ddb7c4e52f1faf76e5c211b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48906/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48906/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48906/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2c8419b537a0229c38e4c56d1fc5c243d017b737","head":{"label":"xupefei:thread-isolated-tags","ref":"thread-isolated-tags","sha":"2c8419b537a0229c38e4c56d1fc5c243d017b737","user":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":777257207,"node_id":"R_kgDOLlQA9w","name":"spark","full_name":"xupefei/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. Aggreges using Lateral Column Alias in ORDER BY should throw LATERAL_COLUMN_ALIAS_IN_AGGREGATE_FUNC\r\n2. AMBIGUOUS_LATERAL_COLUMN_ALIAS if there are 2 or more matches of lateral column aliases\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor 1, \r\nAn invalid case, such as `SELECT MAX(id) AS id2 FROM range(1) ORDER BY AVG(id2)`, is considered valid in versions before 3.2.x. Since version 3.2, a refactoring pull request accidentally 'fixes' this case; however, the error message is not straightforward.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n[MISSING_ATTRIBUTES.RESOLVED_ATTRIBUTE_MISSING_FROM_INPUT] Resolved attribute(s) \"id2\" missing from \"id\" in operator !Aggregate [max(id#130L) AS id2#129L, avg(id2#129L) AS avg(id2#129L)#133].  SQLSTATE: XX000; line 1 pos 36;\r\nProject [id2#129L]\r\n+- Sort [avg(id2#129L)#133 ASC NULLS FIRST], true\r\n   +- !Aggregate [max(id#130L) AS id2#129L, avg(id2#129L) AS avg(id2#129L)#133]\r\n      +- Range (0, 1, step=1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error message somewhat confuses users when debugging/upgrading.\r\n\r\nFor 2, it's bugfix, we shall not ignore the AMBIGUOUS_LATERAL_COLUMN_ALIAS but go further resolution\r\n\r\nIn this pull request, we explicitly address this issue as we did for standard aggregates.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, Aggregates using Lateral Column Alias in ORDER BY throws LATERAL_COLUMN_ALIAS_IN_AGG instead of RESOLVED_ATTRIBUTE_MISSING_FROM_INPUT.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nnew tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to add new function `schema_of_avro` for `avro`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- The schema format of Avro is different from that of Spark when presented to end users. In order to facilitate the intuitive understanding of Avro's schema by end users.\r\n- Similar functions exist in other formats of data, such as `csv`, `json` and `xml`,\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/87a5b37ec3c4b383a5938144612c07187d597ff8/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/FunctionRegistry.scala#L872-L875\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/87a5b37ec3c4b383a5938144612c07187d597ff8/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/FunctionRegistry.scala#L836-L839\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/87a5b37ec3c4b383a5938144612c07187d597ff8/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/FunctionRegistry.scala#L877-L880\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, end-users will be able to clearly know what `Avro's schema` format should look like in `Spark` through the function `schema_of_avro`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Add new UT.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd missing schema check for createDataFrame from numpy ndarray on Spark Connect\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, the conversion from ndarray to pa.table doesn’t consider the schema at all ([for e.g.](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/python/pyspark/sql/connect/session.py#L649)).\r\n\r\nIf we handle the schema separately for ndarray -> Arrow, it will add additional complexity ([for e.g.](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48887/commits/244d8335f7c469f67e21c790d8e75dfc3477bfeb)) and may introduce inconsistencies with Pandas DataFrame behavior—where in Spark Classic, the process is ndarray -> pdf -> Arrow.\r\n\r\nTo maintain consistency and simplicity, we follow this approach in Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nSchema check and verification aligns with Spark Classic now.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-11-19T06:14:51Z","updated_at":"2024-12-10T07:21:33Z","closed_at":"2024-12-10T07:21:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48887/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48887/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48887/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fa86f0e2263af01e7d68daab0099ab8e194c5535","head":{"label":"xinrong-meng:np_schema","ref":"np_schema","sha":"fa86f0e2263af01e7d68daab0099ab8e194c5535","user":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335786381,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3ODYzODE=","name":"spark","full_name":"xinrong-meng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor LazyTry, we want two stack traces:\r\n1. the one from the original execution when the exception happened\r\n2. the one from the current execution, that retrieved the exception.\r\n\r\nThe first one is added as suppressed exception. The second one is stitched into the stack trace of the rethrown exception.\r\n\r\nThe third one (`TRY_WITH_CALLER_STACKTRACE_TRY_STACKTRACE`) doesn't need to be visible to users as a suppressed exception. We only need the depth of the stacktrace until `doTryWithCallerStacktrace`. Use a custom exception `OriginalTryStackTraceException` to store it together with the suppressed first one.\r\n\r\nBecause of the duplicated `TRY_WITH_CALLER_STACKTRACE_TRY_STACKTRACE` exceptions it was actually also doing the stitching incorrectly.\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\nThere are 4 suppressed exception.\r\n(see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48882#issuecomment-2544950040)\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\nThere is 1 suppressed exception, showing the stack trace of the original caller that triggered the computation of the lazy (it is the same as the caller that reads the lazy, because they are read immediately, but it possibly could be different, and then both the stacktraces are needed for debugging)\r\n\r\n(see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48882#issuecomment-2544950040)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe suppressed Exception was too verbose.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Stacktraces of Exceptions coming from a LazyTry (e.g. QueryExecution plans) should be more readable.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests were adapted.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nBreak down https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48355 into smaller PRs. \r\n\r\n## Changelog Reader / Writer\r\nWe purpose to save the lineage to the first line of the changelog files.\r\n\r\nFor changelog reader, there is an abstract function `readLineage` created. In `RocksDBCheckpointManager.getChangelogReader` function, the `readLineage` will be called right after the initialization of the changelog reader to update the file pointer to after the lineage. Subsequent `getNext` function won't be affecter because of this.\r\n\r\nFor changelog writer, there is an abstract function `writeLineage` that writes the lineage. This function will be called before any actual changelog data is written in `RocksDB.load()`.\r\n\r\nThe lineage is stored as json.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nContinue development of SPARK-49374\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is Initial refactoring of SQL Scripting to prepare it for addition of **Execution Framework**:\r\n- Move all files to proper directories/paths.\r\n- Convert `SqlScriptingLogicalOperators` to `SqlScriptingLogicalPlans`.\r\n- Remove `CompoundNestedStatementIteratorExec` because it is unnecessary abstraction.\r\n- Remove `parseScript` because it is no more needed. Parsing is done in `parsePlan` method.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis changes are needed so execution of SQL Scripts can be implemented properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-18T13:00:32Z","updated_at":"2024-11-20T02:08:03Z","closed_at":"2024-11-20T02:08:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"67088bfd02f8ee68ba9ecc8fd8c9e5f37cb0561c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48879/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48879/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48879/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c867696aa6f60d3c2569e181b0768f8a5fcb21fc","head":{"label":"miland-db:milan-dankovic_data/refactor-execution-1","ref":"milan-dankovic_data/refactor-execution-1","sha":"c867696aa6f60d3c2569e181b0768f8a5fcb21fc","user":{"login":"miland-db","id":162123620,"node_id":"U_kgDOCanPZA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162123620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db","html_url":"https://github.com/miland-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":768539955,"node_id":"R_kgDOLc79Mw","name":"spark","full_name":"miland-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"miland-db","id":162123620,"node_id":"U_kgDOCanPZA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162123620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db","html_url":"https://github.com/miland-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/miland-db/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nI propose reverting changes for  new `SQLConf` entry which enables spark to read an invalid collation name as `UTF8_BINARY`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSince the original changes may bring unwanted data corruption when a user writes in a table that has unknown collation and modifies its properties, the original PR must be reverted.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNot applicable.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-11-18T10:34:27Z","updated_at":"2024-11-22T11:22:43Z","closed_at":"2024-11-22T11:22:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cb5c312f4c3041c49be60e0c514043f05cd3fe0e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48876/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48876/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48876/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d366d2742bf6c81d617a30eb316acee1e1e39e94","head":{"label":"vladanvasi-db:vladanvasi-db/allow-reading-unknown-collations-as-utf8-binary-revert","ref":"vladanvasi-db/allow-reading-unknown-collations-as-utf8-binary-revert","sha":"d366d2742bf6c81d617a30eb316acee1e1e39e94","user":{"login":"vladanvasi-db","id":177719017,"node_id":"U_kgDOCpfG6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177719017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db","html_url":"https://github.com/vladanvasi-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":844552718,"node_id":"R_kgDOMlbaDg","name":"spark","full_name":"vladanvasi-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vladanvasi-db","id":177719017,"node_id":"U_kgDOCpfG6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177719017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db","html_url":"https://github.com/vladanvasi-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vladanvasi-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to \r\n- extract `common` logic for `reading the descriptor of PB file` to one place.\r\n- at the same time, when using the `from_protobuf` or `to_protobuf` function in `connect-client` and `spark-sql` (or `spark-shell`), the spark error-condition thrown when `the PB file is not found` or `read fails` will be aligned.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nI found that the logic for `reading the descriptor of PB file` is scattered in various places in the `spark code repository`, eg:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/a01856de20013e5551d385ee000772049a0e1bc0/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/toFromProtobufSqlFunctions.scala#L37-L48\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/a01856de20013e5551d385ee000772049a0e1bc0/sql/api/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/protobuf/functions.scala#L304-L315\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/a01856de20013e5551d385ee000772049a0e1bc0/connector/protobuf/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/protobuf/utils/ProtobufUtils.scala#L231-L241\r\n\r\n- I think we should gather it together to reduce the cost of maintenance.\r\n- Align `spark error-condition` to improve consistency in end-user experience.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-18T08:15:57Z","updated_at":"2024-11-21T11:07:38Z","closed_at":"2024-11-21T11:07:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"45048c76b67322c0cb0788268a1ae639d0d298e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4654282764,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABFWq4DA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PROTOBUF","name":"PROTOBUF","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48874/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48874/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48874/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/046665b91c56182046c99eaf7780735d70c49b4f","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-50334","ref":"SPARK-50334","sha":"046665b91c56182046c99eaf7780735d70c49b4f","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThese changes make the following changes to metrics in TWS:\r\n\r\n- `allUpdatesTimeMs` now captures the time it takes to process all the new data with the user's stateful processor.\r\n- `timerProcessingTimeMs` was added to capture the time it takes to process all the user's timers.\r\n- `allRemovalsTimeMs` now captures the time it takes to do TTL cleanup at the end of a micro-batch.\r\n- `commitTimeMs` now captures _only_ the time it takes to commit the state, not the TTL cleanup.\r\n\r\nWith these metrics, a user can have a fairly clear picture of where time is being spent in a micro-batch that uses TWS:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87a0dc9c-c71b-4d55-8623-8970ad83adf6)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe metrics today misrepresent what they're actually measuring.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Metrics for TWS are changing. However, since TWS is `private[sql]`, this shouldn't impact any real users.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWe don't have any way to test these metrics in _any_ stateful operator for streaming today.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-11-15T19:46:30Z","updated_at":"2024-11-22T05:41:23Z","closed_at":"2024-11-22T05:30:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2fd3086256795d3d436ae100d25897126fb8f9f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to add a script to build docs with image.\r\n\r\nThe overall idea is as follows:\r\n- prepare compiled Spark packages for various subsequent documents (on host)\r\n- build image from cache\r\n- run image as container\r\n  Mount local files to the container (this way, there is no need to copy the spark file to the container, and `the compiled spark package` is already prepared in the `local spark folder`, so there is `no need` to compile it again in the container, otherwise it will re-download many dependency jars, which is very time-cost)\r\n- generate `error docs`, `scala doc`, `python doc` and `sql doc` in container.\r\n- generate `r docs` in host.\r\n  Why does `r` document need to be compiled outside the container ?\r\n  Because when compiling inside the container, the permission of the directory `/__w/spark/spark/R/pkg/docs` automatically generated by `RScript` is `dr-xr--r-x`, and when writing to subsequent files, will throw an error as:\r\n`! [EACCES] Failed to copy '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/pkgdown/BS5/assets/katex-auto.js' to '/__w/spark/spark/R/pkg/docs/katex-auto.js': permission denied`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor developers of pyspark, some python libraries are conflicts between the environment for generating docs and the development environment. In order to help developers verify more easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, only for spark developers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n- Manually test (The verification process can be found in the comments).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-15T11:46:43Z","updated_at":"2024-11-29T07:13:49Z","closed_at":"2024-11-28T09:12:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8d8112f480f1709b2ab38cce8d1970638c815168","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48860/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48860/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48860/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8217eadcb9c13a6e4c23b20fcf36d2b783df9445","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-50295","ref":"SPARK-50295","sha":"8217eadcb9c13a6e4c23b20fcf36d2b783df9445","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache
