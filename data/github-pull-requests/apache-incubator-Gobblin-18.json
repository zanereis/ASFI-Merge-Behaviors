to control compression-\r\n\r\n**1. mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.compress\r\n2. mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.compress.codec\r\n3. mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.compress.type**\r\n\r\nare not passed on to Hadoop from compaction job configuration file as Job config parameters are being overwritten with the hadoop config parameters.\r\n\r\nAs part of fix, unset the job config parameter in hadoop config( before adding the hadoop config into the job config) if it is already set in job config.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n1. Set mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.compress and verify output of compaction job. Output should be compressed with default codec.\r\n2. Reset mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.compress and verify output of compaction job. Output shouldn't be compressed.\r\n3. Set mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.compress and set mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.compress to org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.SnappyCodec and mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.compress.type set to RECORD verify output of compaction job. Output should be compressed with Snappy codec and record level.\r\n4. Set mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.compress and set mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.compress to org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.DefaultCodec mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.compress.type set to BLOCK and verify output of compaction job. Output should be compressed with Deflate codec and block level.\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-13T14:07:28Z","updated_at":"2018-06-15T16:04:31Z","closed_at":"2018-06-15T16:04:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9c6d09439c8a25fee82c8960cafda1f335a171b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2386/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2386/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/2386/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/16ce9823d8af85746a7318572f4028c7e4818817","head":{"label":"SivaAccionLabs:GOBBLIN-412","ref":"GOBBLIN-412","sha":"16ce9823d8af85746a7318572f4028c7e4818817","user":{"login":"SivaAccionLabs","id":22631594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjMxNTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22631594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SivaAccionLabs","html_url":"https://github.com/SivaAccionLabs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SivaAccionLabs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SivaAccionLabs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SivaAccionLabs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SivaAccionLabs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SivaAccionLabs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SivaAccionLabs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SivaAccionLabs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SivaAccionLabs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SivaAccionLabs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"ab7dfe62268c8fbe63a6959fb71cb205f6641f50","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27392543,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzM5MjU0Mw==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"apache/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-510] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-510\r\nToday JobExecutionLauncher and JobExecutionDriver is coupled. It means when JobExecutionLauncher invokes launchJob, a JobExecutionDriver is immediately return. This is not good for gobblin cluster because the Launcher might running in manager node but the actual driver logic is running on worker node. We need some refactoring to allow us decouple these two.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n   - Introduced ExecutionResult, JobExecutionFuture, JobExecutionMonitor and MonitoredObject.\r\n   - Changed JobExecutionLauncher#launcJob interface\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-509\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nEnsure that tar data writer untars within output directory. \r\n\r\nThis is similar to config plan changes, where we enforce that config zip is extracted within desired output directory. \r\n\r\nWhile this is not very critical since we expect source and destination to be safe, it is still a good practice to add this check.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nSome changes to make DeepIterator extensible and easily being overwritten by different implementation of iterators. They includes:\r\n- Several signature change. \r\n- Create `getWorkUnitIterator` method to be overwritten in subclass. \r\n- Create `doComputeNext ` method to separate the logic of getting next available dataset object (Can be a dataset or a partition) from `DeepIterator` itself, so that different iterator that extends it can inherit the existing functionality of looping datasets, watermarks, etc. but have its own logic on how to fetch the next available dataset.\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-492] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-492\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-491\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nTo enable multi-hop routing in GaaS, we need an underlying graph data structure over which paths for data movement get computed. We define basic interfaces and classes to represent the data flow graph.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded a unit test for DAG representation. More unit tests to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-490] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-490\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThis new job launcher will forward original job to GobblinTaskRunner. The GobblinTaskRunner can run the original GobblinHelixJobLauncher. This PR only covers the first forwarding logic. The new GobblinHelixJobLauncher task driver logic on GobblinTaskRunner will be in a spearate PR.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-488\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR:\r\nCurrently, while building an `AsyncRequest` from a collection of records, it doesn't know what records are processed. The pr is to make it records aware so that a `ResponseHandler` can do post-process the records if necessary\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\nIt's more a refactor, leveraging existing unit test: `AsyncHttpWriterTest#testSuccessfulWrites`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

access modifiers for SalesforceWriter to protected to help extend on top of it.\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-486\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nChange access modifiers for SalesforceWriter to protected to help extend on top of it.\r\n\r\nRight now all fields are private and no getter is available. So, we need to open it up to protected for allowing custom impls on top of it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested locally, only access modifier is changed.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Use `AsyncHttpWriter` and `AsyncHttpWriterBuilder` instead\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdd more documentation\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-481\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAdding annotation, \"Alias\", to class, KafkaSimpleJsonExtractor, makes this class loadable by UniversalKafkaSource. Otherwise this class cannot be used.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\npasses :gobblin-modules:gobblin-kafka-common:test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-478\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nLineage events were not getting emitted during Avro2ORC conversion. For this lineage event, source information is set by HiveAvroToOrcSource and destination info is set by HiveConvertPublisher. HiveConvertPublisher gets collection of WorkUnitStates. On invoking getWorkUnit() method on WorkUnitState, publisher was expecting HiveWorkUnit while the returned workunit was ImmutableWorkUnit. \r\nMade changes to make sure, destination info is set correctly in WorkUnitState by HiveConvertPublisher\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit test is present\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-474\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWhen the number of maximum workunits per run setting in LoopingDatasetFinderSource equals the number of remaining datasets to process before the end of the loop, we do not place the \"End-of-Dataset\" marker in the last workunit. The subsequent run turns out to be essentially a no-op and is avoidable by correctly detecting the end-of-datasets.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded a unit test. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-465) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-465] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-465\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nBump API to 2.5.4. Exposes configuration values for performing cert auth. Skips SASL password auth if password is not provided.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: this change is mostly exposing new config values - coverage & flow doesn't really change here, but I'm happy to add tests if they are needed to pass. I have smoke tested the new and old functionality with this build against CB5.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-464\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe need the ability to support a global watermark that spans all datasets as well as a per-dataset watermark in LoopingDatasetFinderSource. In particular we need to keep track of:\r\n\r\nThe last dataset processed in the previous run of a gobblin job (global watermark) so that the subsequent run can process the \"next\" dataset (based on some ordering between datasets), and\r\nThe last time a particular dataset is processed (per-dataset watermark).\r\nThe actual use case is to limit the time range of queries to an external database based on the last processed time of a dataset. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Changed ConvertibleHiveDatasetTest#testLineageInfo accordingly to accommodate the above change.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: ConvertibleHiveDatasetTest#testLineageInfo is the unit test.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-293\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nGPGFileDecryptor materializes the inputstream when generating a new inputstream from a decrypted outputstream. This requires a lot of memory for large files. This PR introduces the `LazyMaterializeDecryptorInputStream` and code changes in `GPGFileDecryptor` to stream the decrypted content without the need for pre-materialization. Each `InputStream` is instantiated only when there is no more data in the previous `InputStream`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nGPGFileDecryptorTest.decryptLargeFileSym\r\nGPGFileDecryptorTest.decryptLargeFileAsym\r\n\r\nA ~1gb file is encrypted and compressed to a few kb and checked in for testing.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-458\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n    Add resource handler logic based on two reasons:\r\n    - Decouple resource handling logic from spec catalog logic (Today we use spec Catalog to trigger all the handling logic, like message forwarding between Standby and Active)\r\n    - Simplify the specListener logic. Because resource handler will be responsible for HA logic so that specCatalog listeners can always assume it was triggered locally. So the GobblinHelixJobScheduler doesn't need to have a specific logic to handle HA.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  GobblinHelixHATest was successfully passed. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\n@abti @htran1 Please accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-456\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n[x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThis PR adds an option to delete the job state store. It also refactor some part of code, which includes:\r\n1) Add Metadata to the JobSpec. It is already present in AvroJobSpec.\r\n2) Add some useful parameters (e.g. delete.state.store) to JobSpec metadata passed via http header\r\n3) Differentiate between UPSERT and DELETE calls by looking at the metadata instead of using Either.Left/Right\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n[x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded test in KafkaJobMonitorTest.java\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-433\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Gobblin tries to get schemas from schema registry (and fails) for non existing topics which was present in an eariler run but removed in the meantime. This pr tries to fix this issue by not getting schema for topic partiton if the gap between high and low watermark is 0 because it might be a deleted topic and it is just an empty Workunit. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below! @htran1  please review\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-428\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\njob states are not getting deleted on the cluster; because KafkaJobMonitor does not instantiate DataSetStore when state.store.enabled is not set to true in global cluster properties.\r\n\r\nstate.store.enabled is job specific and should be required to be set in cluster properties and should not be needed to instantiate DataSetStore.\r\n\r\nAlso, I believe DataSetStore can be tried to be instantiated always, because some job may need it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\nThis pull request is for GOBBLIN-426 ticket. LinkedIn Espresso team needs to implement a slightly different version of AzkabanJobLauncher, where the difference is only in the job listener creation path. However, AzkabanJobLauncher.initJobListener() is a private method, blocking the override. \r\n\r\nThis pull request just changes the signature of that method from private to protected, so that we can override that method and implement our version of AzkabanJobLauncher with minimal code duplication.\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-425\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis is the partition aware implementation of {@link HiveRegistrationPolicyBase}.\r\nYou can specify hive.partition.regex where the first match is the table location and the rest match are the partitions.\r\nThe partition names can be specified with the hive.table.partition.keys property.\r\nThe order of the partition names should match the order of regexp matches in the hive.partition.regexp expression.\r\n\r\n For example in the case of path: s3://testbucket/myawesomlogs/compacted/dt=20170101/hr=22/\r\n The hive.partition.regexp would look like: hive.partition.regex=(s3://testbucket/myawesomelogs/compacted/)dt=(.*)/hr=(.*) and the hive.table.partition.keys=dt,hr\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nJob broker did not get closed when job failed, this may produce unclosed resources possibly hanging the job. This happened because on job failure, an exception would be thrown before the job context was closed. Instead of closing the job context in the commit step, added it to the `AbstractJobLauncher` closer to guarantee closing.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.
