Description\r\n\r\nFixes #7902\r\n\r\nThis PR allows attaching a regular ISO to a VM when it already has the config drive ISO attached.\r\nConfig-drive ISO is now attached with the SR name-label `<VM-NAME>-CONFIGDRIVE-ISO`. While regular ISOs continue to attach with SR name-label `<VM-NAME>-ISO`. VM which already have the configdrive ISO attached before this fix will return an appropriate error and will need to be stopped-start.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the issue #8789 \r\n\r\nThe original issue is disconnectPhysicalDiskByPath() implementation in FibreChannelAdaptor always returns true irrespective of the success of the operation. This was already fixed in the PR #8889 .\r\n\r\nIdeally this method has to be called after choosing the right adapter based on the storage pool type of the volume path, but currently it is just called in a loop. \r\nhttps://github.com/shapeblue/cloudstack/blob/05b9b6e2e77b9b633f0fe22aff5f9f3c047b2303/plugins/hypervisors/kvm/src/main/java/com/cloud/hypervisor/kvm/storage/KVMStoragePoolManager.java#L200-L212\r\n\r\nwhile trying to fix the case of running into the loop of all adapters by somehow passing the storage pool type to that caller cleanup() method but this is touching all over the code (which I fear it creates other regressions), instead I feel we can keep it the current way only since Fibrechannel adapter has already fixed.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I've added the java doc explaining the method and situation.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case

Description\r\n\r\nFixes #8450\r\n\r\nWhen a primary storage on which volumes of system VMs are present is put on maintenance, CloudStack recreates the volume on the other available store. When such recreation is done between stores of different scopes, there are cases in which old volume entries remain in `Destroy` state. This PR expunges such volumes.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and

Description\r\n\r\nWhen an affinity group is composed of dedicated resources, the `listAffinityGroups` API does not show any information about the resources of the group.\r\n\r\nThis PR, therefore, adds which dedicated resources are related to a given affinity group in the `listAffinityGroups` API response and displays a link to them in the UI. Furthermore, the affinity groups default title and description were modified in order to reflect the type of the resource that they are associated with. \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n### Screenshots:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Affinity group details for Root Admin users</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/115510880/bb0df918-c28f-4b93-920b-e455def74ba7)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Affinity group details for non Root Admin users</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/115510880/907d8fc9-b3cb-4f5e-a2a6-f7d145e0e04d)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n#### Tests with a root admin user\r\n\r\n1.

Description\r\n\r\nThe user might create the cluster manually.

Description\r\n\r\nDuring live migration of a VM from between hosts having different cgroup versions (cgroupv2 & cgroup), overcommit ratio is ignored.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the above issue.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n#### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Set overcommit ratio to 2 for the cluster\r\n2. Launch a VM\r\n3. Check value of shares on the host\r\n```bash\r\n$ virsh dumpxml --domain i-2-9-VM | grep shares\r\n    <shares>500</shares>\r\n```\r\n4. Live migrate the VM to another host which has a different cgroup than the existing host of the VM.\r\n5. Live migrate the VM back to the original host. And check the shares again.\r\n```bash\r\n$ virsh dumpxml --domain i-2-9-VM | grep shares\r\n    <shares>1000</shares>\r\n```\r\n6. Stopping and starting the VM on the same host will reset the value back to `500`.\r\nThis happens only when cgroup is different on the destination hosts during live migration. Possibly introduced in #8252 .\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs,

Description\r\n\r\nFollowup from https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/8782\r\n\r\n- Changes behaviour of details param handling via global setting:\r\n  - listVirtualMachines API: when the details param is not provided, it returns whether stats are returned controlled by a new global setting `list.vm.default.details.stats`\r\n  - listVirtualMachinesMetrics API: when the details param is not provided, it uses `all` details including `stats`\r\n- Users who are affected slow performance of the listVirtualMachines API response time can set `list.vm.default.details.stats` to `false`\r\n- Remove ConfigKey vm.stats.increment.metrics.in.memory which was renamed to `vm.stats.increment.metrics` in #5984 and also remove unused/unnecessary global settings via upgrade path\r\n- Changes default value of VM stats accumulation setting `vm.stats.increment.metrics` to false until a better solution emerges. Since #5984, this is true and during the execution of listVM APIs the stats are clubbed/calculated which can immensely slow down list VM API calls. Any costly operations such as summing of stats shouldn't be done during the course of a synchronous API, such as the list VM API.\r\n- Fix UI that uses listVirtualMachinesMetrics to not call `stats` detail when in list view without metrics selected.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [x] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ]

Description\r\n\r\nFixes: #8123 \r\n\r\nCloudStack Xenserver hypervisor plugin calls `VM.destroy` when the VM is stopped or found in Halted state. This PR prevents this destroy action during VM stop or other actions like snapshot. VM.destroy is already called during the execution of the start VM action which should take care of any storage, network device changes.\r\n\r\nTBD: Whether this behavioural change should be controlled by a global configuration?\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n- Deploy a VM\r\n- Take a VM snapshot\r\n- Revert snapshot (This fails as VM is in running state)\r\n- Stop the VM\r\n- Revert snapshot (successful)\r\n\r\n```\r\n(localcloud) 🐱 > deploy virtualmachine

Description\r\n\r\nSome entries are left over in `resource_reservation` table if there is a breach in resource limits or if the management server crashes.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that and also adds additional information in `resource_reservation` table to track when was a reservation created and who created it.\r\n\r\nWe also cleanup any stale entries (older than `resource.reservation.cleanup.delay`, defaults to 3600 seconds) as part of the recalculate resource count method.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Define 2 resource limit host tags - t1, t2\r\n2. Set overall user_vm limit to some higher value - 10\r\n3. Set t1 user_vm limit to a higher value - 5\r\n4. Set t2 user_vm limit to 1Now you'll be able to deploy one VM with t2 tag. When you will try to deploy another VM with t2 tag it should leave some leftover reservations for null and t1 tag\r\n\r\nNow you'll be able to deploy one VM with t2 tag. When you will try to deploy another VM with t2 tag it should leave some leftover reservations for null and t1 tag\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be

it was nice meeting you at Community over Code today. This PR will enable you to publish Build Scans to [ge.apache.org](https://ge.apache.org/) as discussed.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR publishes a build scan for every CI build and for every local build from an authenticated Apache committer. The build will not fail if publishing fails. Local and remote caching was left disabled on this PR by design so that the build is not affected by this change. \r\n\r\nThe build scans of the Apache Cloudstack project are published to the Develocity instance at [ge.apache.org](https://ge.apache.org/), hosted by the Apache Software Foundation and run in partnership between the ASF and Gradle. This Develocity instance has all features and extensions enabled and is freely available for use by the Apache Cloudstack project and all other Apache projects.\r\n\r\nOn this Develocity instance, Apache Cloudstack will have access not only to all of the published build scans but other aggregate data features such as:\r\n\r\n- Dashboards to view all historical build scans, along with performance trends over time\r\n- Build failure analytics for enhanced investigation and diagnosis of build failures\r\n- Test failure analytics to better understand trends and causes around slow, failing, and flaky tests\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there are any questions about the value of Develocity or the changes in this pull request and I’d be happy to address them.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [x] build/CI\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-03T21:31:53Z","updated_at":"2024-10-11T15:08:43Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2b6b53fbf1a82362240296830868e56fb516b5b1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4934162471,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAJTq2M8AAAABJhlYJw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:integration","name":"component:integration","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/9167/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/9167/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/9167/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/9c66ca41e8e5acdd72ac49d3798a4382347f75f8","head":{"label":"ribafish:gk/develocityIntegration","ref":"gk/develocityIntegration","sha":"9c66ca41e8e5acdd72ac49d3798a4382347f75f8","user":{"login":"ribafish","id":15016637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDE2NjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15016637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ribafish","html_url":"https://github.com/ribafish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ribafish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ribafish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ribafish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ribafish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ribafish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ribafish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ribafish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ribafish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ribafish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":809987677,"node_id":"R_kgDOMEduXQ","name":"apache-cloudstack","full_name":"ribafish/apache-cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ribafish","id":15016637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDE2NjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15016637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ribafish","html_url":"https://github.com/ribafish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ribafish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ribafish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ribafish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ribafish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ribafish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ribafish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ribafish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ribafish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ribafish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ribafish/apache-cloudstack","description":"Apache

Description\r\n\r\nWhen a VM has been created using an ISO, its infocard will label the ISO as `Template`. Additionally, any ISO attached to it will be labeled as `ISO`. This behaviour may cause confusion, causing users to believe the installation ISO is a template, or the attached ISO was the installation media.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, the label of the installation media has been edited to be either `Template` or `ISO` depending on its format and the label of the attached ISO has been modified to `Attached ISO`.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking

Description\r\n\r\nIn order to copy an object from a secondary storage to another, the MS sends a copy command to the least busy SSVM; however, removed SSVMs are considered when listing the SSVMs ordered by the quantity of commands being executed. This way, if there are commands that have not finished properly in a removed SSVM, a NPE occurs when sending the copy command if the \"least busy\" SSVM has been removed.\r\n\r\nThis PRs fixes the NPE.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n1. I initiated a data migration between secondary storages;\r\n2. I verified that the `cmd_exec_log` table had one entry for a command sent to the SSVM;\r\n3. Before the data migration finished, I deleted the SSVM;\r\n4. I verified that the `cmd_exec_log` still had one entry for the removed SSVM;\r\n5. I waited until another SSVM was created;\r\n6. I initiated another data migration between secondary storages.\r\n\r\nBefore the changes, step 6 would result in a NPE, as the removed SSVM was sometimes chosen as the least busy SSVM.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n2024-05-24T12:41:47,662 DEBUG [o.a.c.s.i.SecondaryStorageServiceImpl] (pool-19-thread-2:[]) (logid:) Failed to copy Data java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new tester directory and file at `core/src/test/java/com/cloud/serializer/GsonHelperTest.java`. Previously, the `serializer` directory did not exist. The new test file checks the base functionality of GSON conversion into JSON of a Java CloudStack object implementing the `dataStoreTo` interface to ensure it works properly with a CloudStack class.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR includes a test for `OVAProcessor.java` that tests the OVA processing of large objects and adds a test for `PasswordPolicyImpl.java` at `server/src/test/java/com/cloud/user/PasswordPolicyImplTest.java`. The new test verifies that a password meets all test case points (such as length, minimum special characters, minimum uppercase characters, regex specifications) instead of just individual criteria.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [X ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\n\r\nThe tests were designed to cover various edge cases and typical usage scenarios to ensure robustness. For `GsonHelperTest.java`, different CloudStack objects were serialized and deserialized to verify GSON conversion accuracy. For `OVAProcessor.java`, large file sizes were used to test the OVA processing logic.

Description\r\n\r\nThe configuration update process mixes type validation with range validation in `com.cloud.configuration.ConfigurationManagerImpl#validateConfigurationValue`. To improve this process, this PR splits these validations into two methods (`validateValueType` and `validateValueRange`) and cleans up the code.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this PR also fixes an issue that allows non-numeric values to be inserted into `Double` configurations, such as `zone.virtualnetwork.ipv6subnet.capacity.notificationthreshold`.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [X] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI manually verified the behavior of trying to update configurations of the following types, and compared them with the previous version to ensure the result was expected:\r\n\r\n- `String` - `quota.currency.symbol` and `alert.email.addresses` (that is, one that does not have `null` as a valid value and another that does);\r\n- `Boolean` - `admin.is.allowed.to.deploy.anywhere`;\r\n- `Integer` - `storage.cleanup.interval`. (the validations for this type also apply to `Short` and `Long`);\r\n- `Float` - `cpu.overprovisioning.factor` (also applies to `Double`).\r\n\r\n| Number | Test | Result | Expected result (Y/N)?

Description\r\n\r\nDesign Document: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/CKS+Enhancements\r\n\r\nThis PR extends the CloudStack Kubernetes Service functionalities, matching these requirements:\r\n \r\n- [x] **Ability to specify different compute or service offerings for different types of CKS cluster nodes – worker, master or etcd:** The createKubernetesCluster API and the corresponding UI must provide an option to provide different offering for different types of nodes. CKS compute offerings will be marked as CKS compatible.\r\n- [x] **Ability to use CKS ready custom templates for CKS cluster nodes:** CKS will allow users to specify their own templates for different CKS node types (control and worker) at the point of cluster creation. Those templates will be marked as CKS compatible.\r\n- [x] **Ability to use generic (non CKS ready) custom templates for CKS cluster nodes:** CKS will allow users to specify their own templates for different CKS node types (control and worker) at the point of cluster creation. Those templates will be marked as CKS compatible. The user will be responsible for installing all necessary packages in the template.\r\n- [x] **Ability to add and remove a pre-created instance as a worker node to an existing CKS cluster:** An instance (either virtual of physical) which has been built and prepared for CKS can been added to the desired CKS cluster. The instance must have all the CKS worker node packages installed.\r\n- [x] **Ability to separate etcd from master nodes of the CKS cluster:** End users should be provided with an option to separate etcd cluster at the time of CKS cluster creation. The user can enable such option in the UI or in the createKubernetesCluster API and specify the size of the etcd cluster. Based on the user inputs CloudStack should be able to provision such etcd nodes for the CKS cluster.\r\n- [x] **Ability to mark CKS cluster nodes for manual only upgrade:** An end user should be able to mark the desired compute offering (or the CKS template) for manual upgrades only. CKS cluster nodes marked for manual upgrade should be untouched during the Kubernetes version upgrade when executed using upgradeKubernetesCluster API.\r\n- [x] **Ability to dedicate specific hosts/clusters to a specific domain for CKS cluster deployment:** The dedicateHost/dedicateCluster APIs can be used to provide this functionality to dedicate hosts/clusters for CKS cluster deployments. During the deployment of CKS cluster node VMs they will by default be deployed in the dedicated cluster.\r\n- [x] **Methodology for AS number management:** Operators should be able to assign a range of AS numbers to an ACS Zone. ACS must have a method to assign an AS number to each Isolated network (or VPC tier), which can be retrieved via the UI and API. (Introduced on PR #9470)\r\n- [x] **Methodology to use diverse CNI plugins (Calico, Cilium, etc…):** End users should be able to deploy CKS clusters with Calico CNI. An option to specify which CNI plugin to be used for a CKS cluster must be provided in the createKubernetesClusterCmd API. The CNI configuration and setup can be registered as a managed userdata, and any configurable parameters – here, AS number, BGP Peer AS number and IP address, can be defined as variables in the userdata be set during the creation of the CKS cluster. This provides a flexible way for users to use the CNI plugin of their choice.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue when using the LDAP integration with ACS. PR #6812 normalized the account and domain configurations to only encrypt the values with configurations in the `Hidden` and `Secure` categories. However, that PR failed to address the use of these configurations. This resulted in using the encrypted value of the configuration, when it should decrypt it first, as observed in issue #8637.\r\n\r\nThis problem was fixed by adding the method `getActualValue()` that checks if the configurations in the Account and Domain are in the `Hidden` and `Secure` categories, and decrypting it, if needed.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** For users that manually set the configurations `ldap.bind.password` and `ldap.truststore.password` to a plain value in order to fix the faulty behaviour, it is required to store them encrypted. It will not be possible to update the configuration via UI, as an exception will be thrown when ACS tries to decrypt the plain value. To fix this, it is required to set the password again for ACS to encrypt it. There are two options:\r\n\r\n- Manually set the configuration via CloudMonkey, for example `update configuration domainid=<domain-uuid> name=\"ldap.bind.password\" value=\"password\"`;\r\n- Or, removing the defined configuration through the database via the query `DELETE from cloud.domain_details WHERE name like \"%ldap%password%\"`, and setting the configuration via UI for the affected domains.\r\n\r\nFixes #8637 \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIn a lab with version 4.19.0 installed, I configured an LDAP server and tried to create and LDAP account, which resulted in the following error `LDAP: error code 49 - Invalid Credentials`. After applying the changes in this patch, no exception was thrown, and the accounts in the LDAP server were correctly listed.","created_at":"2024-05-16T19:54:13Z","updated_at":"2024-06-18T08:31:36Z","closed_at":"2024-06-18T08:31:36Z","merged_at":"2024-06-18T08:31:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"a10eee25b3432a268597e54e05024933bed90c0a","assignee":{"login":"BryanMLima","id":42067040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDY3MDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42067040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanMLima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"BryanMLima","id":42067040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDY3MDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42067040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanMLima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanMLima/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/31","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/31","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/31/labels","id":9981290,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AmE1q","number":31,"title":"4.19.1.0","description":"issues

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR...\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\nfixes a bug that compares two Long objects, instead of their primitives. The comparison of two Long objects with the same underlying long value returned as not equal, throwing an error even though the public IP address was correctly assigned to the VPC associated with the guest network. This issue does not occur when comparing the primitives.\r\n\r\nWhen this issue occurs, any cluster using a guest network in a particular VPC will always throw the error.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [X] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\nIn a test environment, any attempt to create a CKS cluster on a specific VPC always returned the error \"Public IP with ID: ... linked to the Kubernetes cluster: ... is not usable\".

I tried some variation of tags and offerings, and everything looks good.

Description\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to start a VM, if an error occurs, the exception displayed to users is the same as what is being logged, which can expose information about the environment.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this issue by keeping the current message to be sent to the logs and adding a new one for the exception shown to users.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n###

Tested?\r\n\r\nUsing a stopped VM, I changed the _Compute Offering_ to a offering with `Host Tags` incompatible with every host in my environment in order to force the exception, then I tried to start the VM. An exception was thrown as shown in the screenshots above.\r\n\r\nI also checked the logs in both cases and the only changes was log level and the removal of a duplicated message at the end of the log related to the exception.\r\n\r\nOld log:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024-05-06T19:19:34,582 WARN [c.c.v.ClusteredVirtualMachineManagerImpl] (Work-Job-Executor-35:[ctx-613c449f, job-326/job-327, ctx-6739b946])
