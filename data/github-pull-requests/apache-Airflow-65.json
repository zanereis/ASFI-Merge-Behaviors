above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\nAs documented in #37089 the SQLThresholdCheckOperator will currently fail if a \"falsey\" value is returned from the query (e.g. 0 or \"\").\r\nThis is a fix to change the error check a bit and as side effect make the exception for `The following query returned zero rows:...`\r\nWhereas before, if no rows really were returned, the user would see the following:\r\n```\r\nresult = hook.get_first(self.sql)[0]\r\nTypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor testing, I used a parameterized test on an existing test and added a new test to cover the \"no rows returned\" case.\r\nBut please let me know if something else would be preferable.\r\n\r\ncloses:

PR changes how `exec_config` works for the ECS executor. Previously the `exec_config` was only applied to item zero of the `containerOverrides` list (the container that receives the Airflow task command). This made it impossible for folks to override any configuration at the base or `overrides` level of the runTask kwargs (see docs for possible configuration [here](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/ecs/client/run_task.html)).\r\n\r\nThe new strategy is to treat the `exec_config` as an entire run task kwargs config and do a recursive dict update. This allows folks to set any value from a task or DAG.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour change is allowed due to the feature still being experimental.\r\n\r\nfixes #35490\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

have the `--upgrade-on-failure` flag that was used to automatically upgrade image when constraint build failed. This happens when there is a conflicting change merged, but the CI build has not managed yet to refresh the constraints (which sometime might take some time due to stability of our CI infrastructure - any intermittent failures in tests might delay constraint refreshing).\r\n\r\nWhat happens in this case, locally when you build image you would get dependency conflict.\r\n\r\nThis PR flips the flag in local environmment in two cases:\r\n\r\n* when you run `breeze ci-image build` manually\r\n* when you run CI image build automatically while running other command\r\n\r\nOn CI we want to keep control over constraint use, so the flag default is set to False in CI environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

pyproject.toml generated dependencies from providers are now generated in a bit more streamlined way:\r\n\r\n* the \"empty\" dependencies are now single-line empty arrays, to make github renderer of pyproject.toml happied (especially when showing diff in preview\r\n\r\n* instead of calculating hashes and preventing generation of pyproject.toml, we now always generate it when the pre-commit is run. This is possible because generation is stable and produces always the same results from the same input, so we can safely regenerate the file in CI with `--all-files` and the file will not be changed. This way we avoid Hash collision when we have parallel changes coming to different providers.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

change attempts to automatically upgrade our dependencies in the canary builds. This means that canary builds will fail occasionally when there is a need to update some dependencies that otherwise are not updated automatically. This gives an opportunity to fix such failing main build as soon as it happns.\r\n\r\nIt does not impact generation of constraints or building the cache, the only sign that things are wrong is failing canary build, so impact to it should be minimal - we will either see the main build failing after merge, or we will fix it alongside with fixing some other reason for main failing (such us broken dependencies)\r\n\r\nWith this change, the following upgrades are done in canary build:\r\n\r\n* Upgrading pre-commits\r\n* Upgrading black version\r\n* Upgrading build pinned dependencies\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Also added a DataToADLSOperator which uses the AzureDataLakeStorageV2Hook which allows uploading data (like from an XCOM of a previous task for example as we had the case) to a remote file without the need to create a local file first.

This PR introduces the use of logical operators (`|` for OR and `&` for AND) to link `Dataset` instances, simplifying the expression of complex dependencies.\r\n\r\nKey Enhancements:\r\n- Logical operators `|` and `&` for combining `Dataset` objects.\r\n- Enhanced URI validation within the `Dataset` class.\r\n- New `DatasetAny` and `DatasetAll` classes for OR/AND conditions.\r\n- `DatasetsExpression` class for building dataset condition trees.\r\n- `extract_datasets` function to interpret these expression trees.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\ndataset1 = Dataset(uri=\"s3://bucket1/data1\")\r\ndataset2 = Dataset(uri=\"s3://bucket2/data2\")\r\ndataset3 = Dataset(uri=\"s3://bucket3/data3\")\r\ndataset4 = Dataset(uri=\"s3://bucket4/data4\")\r\ndataset5 = Dataset(uri=\"s3://bucket5/data5\")\r\n\r\nexpr = dataset1 | (dataset2 & dataset3)\r\n# expr translates to DatasetAny(dataset1, DatasetAll(dataset2, dataset3)))\r\n\r\nexpr1 =  ((dataset1 & dataset2) | dataset3) & (dataset4 | dataset5)\r\n\r\n# expr1 translates to DatasetAll(DatasetAny(DatasetAll(dataset1, dataset2), dataset3), DatasetAny(dataset4, dataset5))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis update offers a more intuitive way of expressing dataset dependencies in Airflow workflows.\r\n\r\n_Depends on the merge of PR apache/airflow#37016._\r\n\r\n## Dependency Checklist\r\n- [x] PR #37016 should be merged

new run type \"triggered\" to distinguish manual DAG runs and triggered DAG runs (`TriggerDagRunOperator`).\r\n\r\n### Justification to introduce a new RunType\r\nBefore this improvement, we were prepending the run id with the string \"manual\" for `TriggerDagRunOperator` as well as manual run (which can be started on UI). This can cause a misunderstanding when we look for the logs and also for the UI. We did not have a way to distinguish **manual runs** and the **triggered runs** (which can be done with `TriggerDagRunOperator`).\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, I introduced the followings:\r\n- A new RunType value:\r\n```python3\r\nTRIGGERED = \"triggered\"\r\n```\r\n- A new icon for UI:\r\n  ```typescript\r\n  import { MdBolt } from \"react-icons/md\";\r\n  // ...\r\n      case \"triggered\":\r\n        return <MdBolt style={iconStyle} {...rest} />;\r\n  //...\r\n  ```\r\n  which is look likes the following (in action):\r\n  ![output](https://github.com/VladaZakharova/airflow/assets/5708658/dd93b05b-fd81-4bdd-bffe-4a7b080fde1e)\r\n\r\n  > Of course, we can change the icon with another icon that can be more suitable but as a entry point, I selected this one.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

GKEPodAsyncHook does not support service_file. Thus, passing credentials through \" Keyfile Path \" or \" Keyfile JSON \" will be ignored. This PR intends to fix this issue. As the default value of `service_file` in `Token` is None (https://github.com/talkiq/gcloud-aio/blob/8c8e1b39ec2e40b42212c270acb98c039267fbc5/auth/gcloud/aio/auth/token.py#L157) and the return value of `service_file_as_context` when both key file path and key file json are not provided is None.

with static analysis).\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\nThis is a step number 3 of the process described in #36876 , please refer to it for the rationale and in depth description.\r\n\r\n## Future possibilities\r\nWe can probably incorporate this information inside the actual class/method docs and not in separate page.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^

the last rework of the trigger form to prevent a XSS we did not fully test the UI when the configuration `show_trigger_form_if_no_params` is set to True.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the reported problem as reported in #36843 by submitting a virtual empty form.\r\nAlongside I found that there is a key error if some required fields are not set, which still is validated. In such cases an Exception was produced earlier, now it is correctly forwarding and forcing the user to enter data into the form.\r\n\r\nHow to test (needs to be made manually :-( ):\r\n- Run Airflow and trigger a DAG with params (e.g. example_params_ui_tutorial) and one without (e.g. example_bash_decorator) and see like before form is displayed depending on params defined on the DAG.\r\n- Start webserver with `AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__SHOW_TRIGGER_FORM_IF_NO_PARAMS=True` and try to start the two DAGs above with and without params. Shuod fix the bug reported.\r\n\r\ncloses: #36843 \r\n","created_at":"2024-01-28T20:05:22Z","updated_at":"2024-01-29T12:50:57Z","closed_at":"2024-01-29T12:50:57Z","merged_at":"2024-01-29T12:50:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"1197f2ff654e2fdafbb9d410a8d99cb6d6d3f8e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: Bug Fixes"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

adds the possibility to store xcoms on a object storage supported backend.\r\n\r\nThis is an initial implementation and I am open for feedback (duh ;-) ). The BaseXCom is a bit messy and required some bug fixes. Hence, I have implemented the backend currently separated from BaseXCom. While functionally it is quite easy to merge both.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n* Made sure that custom serialization is now called when using `get_one`\r\n* Added the `purge` function that is called when deleting / clearing xcoms so custom backend can purge xcom when required. This has also been reported as a bug: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/31774\r\n* I have looked at FSMap that comes with fsspec, but decided that wasn't worth the effort and did not provide extra flexibility\r\n* I could move this implementation to `common.io` but given that I'd like to merge it with the standard BaseXCom I though to put it where it is now. Can be discussed of course\r\n* The state of BaseXCom leaves something to be desired\r\n\r\n@potiuk @dstandish @hussein-awala @uranusjr \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

our process, we generally do not let the scripts in the \"build images\" workflow to use `scripts/ci`, `dev` and `action` scripts to come from the PR. This is a security feature that prevent Pull Requests from forks to run code on a worker that can potentially access sensitive information - such as GITHUB_TOKEN with write access to Github Registry.\r\n\r\nThis, however, causes troubles, because in order to test any changes in those scripts affecting building image, you have to close your PR from the fork and push one directly to Apache repository (there in-line build workflows are used from \"Test\" workflow and those PRs are safe to run, because only committers can push directly to the `apache/airflow` repository branches.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes default behaviour for committer PRs. Rather than do the same as \"regular\" PRs, those PRs will not use scripts from the target branch, instead they will use scripts from the incoming PRs of the committers. This is equally safe as running PRs from the `apache/airflow` branch - because we have a reviewed list of committers in our code and \"selective checks\" job that checks it is run always in the context and with the code of the \"target\" branch, which means that you cannot manipulate the list of actors.\r\n\r\nThe Girhub actor is retrieved from pull requests github context (event/pull_request/user/login) so it is impossible to spoof it by the incoming PR.\r\n\r\nAs part of this PR - list of available selective checks and documentation of PR labels and selective checks (wrongly named as \"static checks\") were reviewed and updated.\r\n\r\nWhile impolementing this, we also realised that we can simplify\r\nbranch information retrieval. The code that we had in workflow\r\nwas written a long time ago, when the target branch was always\r\n\"main\" - so we had to check-out the target commit to be able to\r\nretrieve branch_defaults.py and get the branches from there. However\r\nit's already for quite some time that \"pull request workflow\"\r\nuses \"base_ref\" as the base commit, which means that in `main` it\r\nis `main` and in `v2-8-test` it is `v2-8-stable`, which means that\r\nwe already have the correct `AIRFLOW_BRANCH` and the\r\n`DEFAULT_AIRFLOW_CONSTRAINTS_BRANCH` without having to check\r\nthe incoming commit. Which means that we do not need to override\r\nscripts in the build-info step, we only need to check it out\r\ntemporarily to fetch the incoming PR and it's parent to see\r\nwhat files are changed in the incoming PR.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

\"generated/provider_dependencies.json\" is regenerated automatically together with pyproject.toml from all the provider.yaml files. The file contains information about dependencies for all providers and it is used to determine a number of actions when we build providers (for example it is used to automatically generated cross-provider dependencies, and determine whether provider is ready to be released)\r\n\r\nThe \"dependencies\" from provider_dependencies.json are also reflected in pyproject.toml file in order to determine what should be installed when you install specific editable extra, so pyproject.toml is also generated automatically together with\r\nprovider_dependencies.json. All is good when that generation is done automatically, but so far, when you updated provider_dependencies.json manually, the pyproject.toml was not regenerated - it was actually skipped from regeneration.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes it by storing hash of provider_depenedencies.json (mixed with the has of the script that generates them) in the generated pyproject.toml file. This way, both - provider_dependencies and pyproject.toml wil always be regenerated by the\r\n\"update_providers_dependencies.py\" pre-commit whenever there is any inconsistency between provider.yaml files, provider_dependencies.json or pyproject.toml.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

create an S3 object from the output of a sql qurey. Unless you specify a groupby_kwargs parameter, the entire data will be written in one object. This could results on data pipeline issues especially when output files are consumed by limited resources workers (like Kubernetes pods).\r\nSo I suggest adding a new paramter, `max_rows_per_file`, to limit the size of destination files and dispatch output data into multiple files.\r\n\r\n**Use case/motivation**\r\nI faced a lot of out-of-memory issues when trying to process SqlToS3Operator destination object. With such a feature, output will be standardized and next compute worker can easily has an adequate size and a predictable run time.\r\n\r\n**Code of Conduct**\r\n I agree to follow this project's

\"generated/provider_dependencies.json\" is regenerated automatically together with pyproject.toml from all the provider.yaml files. The file contains information about dependencies for all providers and it is used to determine a number of actions when we build providers (for example it is used to automatically generated cross-provider dependencies, and determine whether provider is ready to be released)\r\n\r\nThe \"dependencies\" from provider_dependencies.json are also reflected in pyproject.toml file in order to determine what should be installed when you install specific editable extra, so pyproject.toml is also generated automatically together with\r\nprovider_dependencies.json. All is good when that generation is done automatically, but so far, when you updated provider_dependencies.json manually, the pyproject.toml was not regenerated - it was actually skipped from regeneration.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes it by storing hash of provider_depenedencies.json (mixed with the has of the script that generates them) in the generated pyproject.toml file. This way, both - provider_dependencies and pyproject.toml wil always be regenerated by the\r\n\"update_providers_dependencies.py\" pre-commit whenever there is any inconsistency between provider.yaml files, provider_dependencies.json or pyproject.toml.\r\n\r\nRelated: #37040\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

#36221\r\n\r\nmotivation:\r\nas mention in [docs](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-apache-hive/stable/connections/hive_cli.html#:~:text=proxy_user%20Specify%20a,as%20user%3D%E2%80%9Das_param%E2%80%9D) today it's not intuitive to use proxy user in `HiveOperator`. this pr **remove** the options to set proxy user according to owner or login while **keeping** the option to set proxy user in the connection, although make it easier to set proxy_user with just sending it as parameter to the operator:\r\n```python\r\nHiveOperator(task_id=\"test_default_config_queue\",proxy_user=\"dummy user\"..)\r\n```\r\nalso this pr move the extra parameters to independent cell in hive client connection and make it more friendly.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor
