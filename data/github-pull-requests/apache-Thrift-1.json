Since it throws, we throw away the buffer and the read, so we should check it earlier.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we check for varint_size + strlen instead of only strlen. However, since we can read varint using borrow and consume, this already decreases the remainingMessageSize by varint_size.

nodejs\r\n\r\n`createClient` is exposed in a nodejs context, but not for browsers. Even though this is the same function as `createWsClient`, `createHttpClient`, etc, it would be better to be able to use the generic name with custom connection types. There is no reason I know of that prevents this from being exposed in a browser context - it appears to be more of an oversight.  \r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n \r\nThis PR fixes the clang build (for the thrift compiler) and makes the Rust tutorial build pass as well.\r\n\r\nThe C++ changes fix `inconsistent override` compiler warnings, and the Rust change fixes a clippy warning about an unnecessary dereference.\r\n\r\nI tested this with the below, which now passes (previously failed):\r\n\r\n```\r\n./configure --disable-dependency-tracking --without-python --without-ruby --without-perl  --without-py3 --without-swift --without-nodejs\r\nmake -j16\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  ([Request account here](https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html), **not required for trivial changes**)\r\n- [ ] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/14281 it was noticed that the go parquet implementation writes metadata containing boolean lists in an unexpected encoding. The collection type was encoded as `0x02`, which the documentation now specifies as an allowed alternative value to `0x01`. The values were encoded as 0 (false) and 1 (true), which matches a previous version of the documentation (see documentation update in https://github.com/apache/thrift/commit/2c29c5665bc442e703480bb0ee60fe925ffe02e8). This change makes the rust `TCompactInputProtocol` support both variations.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\nHappy to create a jira ticket if needed.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  ([Request account here](https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html), not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [ ] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

nodejs\r\n\r\nThis adds a flag to the JS generator to output ES modules instead of CommonJS. This is only valid when targeting node. A lot of the changes here are to test this.\r\n\r\nThe `testAll.sh` script now generates an ES module version of the services and types, and tests the client and the server with these. This has a few knock-on effects. Firstly, any module that imports a generated ES module must itself be an ES module, since CommonJS modules cannot import ES modules. ES modules also do not support `NODE_PATH`, so instead the tests directory is converted into a node package with a `file:` dependency on the root thrift package.\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n  \r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  ([Request account here](https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html), not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\nThis PR adds support for AIX by splitting the `syscall.Recvfrom()` call into AIX and non-AIX variants. This split is necessary because AIX does not have a `MSG_DONTWAIT` flag, but has an equivalent called `MSG_NONBLOCK`.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  ([Request account here](https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html), not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

with type_hints enabled, we do not explicitly declare the type of generated all_structs. It's meant to be a list of different types, but that will cause problems, as the generated code is usually like this:\r\n\r\n    all_structs = []\r\n    ...\r\n    all_structs.append(Type1)\r\n    ...\r\n    all_structs.append(Type2)\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nThe first append infers the type of all_struct to be list[Type1], so mypy would start complaining from the 2nd append as the type is unexpected.\r\n\r\nExplicitly declare all_struct to be list[typing.Any] instead, which fixes the

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the option `no_constructors` in the C++ generator. This option elides declaring and defining:\r\n* constructor/destructor\r\n* move/copy constructor/assignment\r\n\r\nIn addition this PR fixes some minor issues:\r\n1. `gen_no_skeleton_` documentation was incorrect\r\n2. when `templates` are requested, avoid any `virtual` functions\r\n\r\nAllowing the compiler to emit the default set of constructor/destructor/assignment operators makes the code faster as it allows inlining when they are trivial. This improves creating deep/elaborate thrift objects.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

(not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\nIf a thrift struct has a member named `read`, it causes a naming collision. This change renames `read` to `thriftRead` and `write` to `thriftWrite` on generated JavaScript classes.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  ([Request account here](https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html), not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [ ] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\nI reviewed the NodeJS library code to see if read or write was called directly on the generated classes:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>`read` calls in NodeJS library</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n❯ rg '\\.read\\('\r\nbinary_protocol.js\r\n193:    name = this.trans.read(sz);\r\n271:  var buff = this.trans.read(8);\r\n288:  return this.trans.read(len);\r\n\r\ncompact_protocol.js\r\n727:  var buff = this.trans.read(8);\r\n769:  return this.trans.read(size);\r\n\r\nheader_transport.js\r\n280:  this.read(endOfHeaders);\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nSo `.read` is only called on the transports.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>write calls in NodeJS library</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\nserver.js\r\n49:            stream.write(buf); // TCP connection\r\n\r\nconnection.js\r\n187:    self.write(data);\r\n^ Connection.prototype\r\n196:  this.connection.write(data);\r\n^ Connection.prototype\r\n387:    self.write(data);\r\n^ StdIOConnection.prototype\r\n396:  this.connection.write(data);\r\n^ StdIOConnection.prototype\r\n\r\nhttp_connection.js\r\n227:  req.write(data);\r\n^ The http request\r\n\r\nmultiplexed_protocol.js\r\n56:    connection.write(buf,seqid);\r\n^ Third argument `connection` on Multiplexer.prototype.createClient.

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\nAs distutils is removed in python 3.12, and setuptools provides the same interface, it can be switched in place with only minor changes. This allows using the thrift bindings on versions of Python 3.12 or greater, and in python environments without distutils installed(such as NixOS, which does not expose setuptools' internal distutils distribution)\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  ([Request account here](https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html), not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [ ] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [ x Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.","created_at":"2024-07-19T18:25:46Z","updated_at":"2024-07-23T17:12:39Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"247016a113506d3f8332fac882acde1c00891608","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4722449056,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAS9U88AAAABGXraoA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/labels/python","name":"python","color":"006B75","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/3007/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/3007/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/3007/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/statuses/b9de5ca24d108b33f03b46bc82471609af28fc56","head":{"label":"pyrox0:master","ref":"master","sha":"b9de5ca24d108b33f03b46bc82471609af28fc56","user":{"login":"pyrox0","id":35778371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzc4Mzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35778371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyrox0","html_url":"https://github.com/pyrox0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyrox0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyrox0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyrox0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyrox0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyrox0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyrox0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyrox0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyrox0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyrox0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":831127076,"node_id":"R_kgDOMYn-JA","name":"thrift","full_name":"pyrox0/thrift","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pyrox0","id":35778371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzc4Mzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35778371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyrox0","html_url":"https://github.com/pyrox0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyrox0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyrox0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyrox0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyrox0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyrox0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyrox0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyrox0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyrox0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyrox0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pyrox0/thrift","description":"Apache
