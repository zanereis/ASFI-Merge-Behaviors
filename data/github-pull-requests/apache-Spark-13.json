What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to fix read csv `fails` when data contains `spaces` before and after, includes: `reading CSV files` and the sql function `from_csv`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- In production, we found a strange behavior of function `from_csv`, as follows:\r\n  \r\n  A.Parse failed\r\n  <img width=\"428\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db560b79-e6fb-4146-8e5e-ba00b78555db\">\r\n  ```sql\r\n  spark-sql (default)> select from_csv('1, 1', 'a INT, b INT');\r\n  from_csv(1, 1)\r\n  {\"a\":1,\"b\":null}\r\n  Time taken: 1.034 seconds, Fetched 1 row(s)\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  B.Parse successful\r\n  ```sql\r\n  spark-sql (default)> select from_csv('1, 1', 'a INT, b FLOAT');\r\n  from_csv(1, 1)\r\n  {\"a\":1,\"b\":1.0}\r\n  Time taken: 0.091 seconds, Fetched 1 row(s)\r\n\r\n  spark-sql (default)> select from_csv('1, 1', 'a INT, b DOUBLE');\r\n  from_csv(1, 1)\r\n  {\"a\":1,\"b\":1.0}\r\n  Time taken: 0.074 seconds, Fetched 1 row(s)\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- The final logic used by internal `parse` is as follows\r\n\r\n  A.Int: java.lang.Integer.parseInt(...)\r\n  ```\r\n  scala> val x = java.lang.Integer.parseInt(\" 1\")\r\n  java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: \" 1\"\r\n    at java.base/java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:67)\r\n    at java.base/java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:654)\r\n    at java.base/java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:786)\r\n    ... 41 elided\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  B.Double: java.lang.Double.parseDouble(...)\r\n  ```scala\r\n  scala> val x = java.lang.Double.parseDouble(\" 1\")\r\n  val x: Double = 1.0\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  ```java\r\n  public static double parseDouble(String s) throws NumberFormatException {\r\n    return FloatingDecimal.parseDouble(s);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  <img width=\"800\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/406ca81f-2d11-4a1a-9f42-bd8e5ffab03f\">\r\n\r\n#### We found that `Double.parseDouble` and `Float.parseFloat` has already processed scenes with `spaces before and after` internally, however, type `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `boolean` and `decimal` did not handle similar scenarios.\r\n\r\n- Because the above are all `numerical` types, I think we need to align them with `float` or `double`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, `numeric data` with spaces before and after will be parsed correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-25T07:01:33Z","updated_at":"2024-11-12T07:30:26Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48653/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48653/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48653/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9f1e584b0e510dfdd26973da4269518e5a183720","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-50110","ref":"SPARK-50110","sha":"9f1e584b0e510dfdd26973da4269518e5a183720","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWith the introduction of the TransformWithState operator, we are going to persist all state information in the StateStore with Avro encoding, instead of UnsafeRow. This is because UnsafeRow is not backwards compatible and can change between Spark releases, potentially causing StateStore corruptions. Avro is backwards-compatible and can be reliably used. This change will move the necessary files to the sql/core directory so Avro encoding can be used by stateful streaming operators.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo allow classes within sql/core, like the StateTypesEncoder class, to be able to use Avro encoding.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit tests are sufficient to ensure compilation\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds SQL pipe syntax support for the WINDOW clause within the pipe SELECT operator `|> SELECT`. \r\n\r\nFor example\r\n```sparksql\r\nCREATE TEMPORARY VIEW t \r\nAS SELECT * from VALUES\r\n  (1, 'apple', 1),\r\n  (2, 'banana', 2),\r\n  (3, 'apple', 3),\r\n  (4, 'banana', 4),\r\nAS t(id, name, amount);\r\n\r\nTABLE t\r\n|> SELECT id, name, amount, SUM(amount) OVER w\r\n   WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY name ORDER BY id);\r\n\r\n1, apple, 1, 3\r\n3, apple, 2, 3\r\n2, banana, 3, 7\r\n4, banana, 4, 7\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n1. `|> WHERE` is not extended to use the WINDOW clause because `|> WHERE` does not support window functions in its expressions.\r\n<!-- 2. A window definition can still be referred by an upstream `|> SELECT` but not by a downstream `|> SELECT`. This is similar to the regular SQL syntax: a window definition defined at the top level can be seen in the subquery but a window definition defined at the bottom level (within a subquery) cannot be seen at the top level.  -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nTo clarify, the window operator does not fully align with the [original implementation](https://github.com/google/zetasql/blob/master/docs/pipe-syntax.md#window-pipe-operator\r\n), which specifies that a window operator should always include a window function with an OVER clause. However, in Spark's syntax, the window operator only returns a window definition without requiring an OVER clause.\r\n\r\nI think it makes sense to keep the existing window syntax (as shown in the above example) since the `Extend` clause will cover the window operator’s functionality as described in the paper. \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe SQL pipe operator syntax will let users compose queries in a more flexible fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-10-25T02:12:49Z","updated_at":"2024-11-18T00:28:27Z","closed_at":"2024-11-13T08:01:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fd5515e3757ba606dee955e47db5536884c5be1b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48649/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48649/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48649/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/71741937cf69b9f0042d5e5f8281182763d6683d","head":{"label":"Angryrou:pipe-window","ref":"pipe-window","sha":"71741937cf69b9f0042d5e5f8281182763d6683d","user":{"login":"Angryrou","id":8079921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzk5MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8079921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angryrou","html_url":"https://github.com/Angryrou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angryrou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angryrou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angryrou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angryrou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angryrou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angryrou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angryrou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angryrou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angryrou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":877563325,"node_id":"R_kgDONE6NvQ","name":"spark","full_name":"Angryrou/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Angryrou","id":8079921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzk5MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8079921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angryrou","html_url":"https://github.com/Angryrou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angryrou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angryrou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angryrou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angryrou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angryrou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angryrou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angryrou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angryrou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Angryrou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Angryrou/spark","description":"Apache

break compatibility with generated code from older major versions.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a note on compatibility issues between the `from_avro` function and the Confluent Schema Registry.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvro data produced by the Confluent Schema Registry serializer adds extra bytes to the serialised data, and the `from_avro` function lacks built-in support for this. This can lead to some very confusing errors if one is not aware of this technical detail. There is a [thread on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48882723/integrating-spark-structured-streaming-with-the-confluent-schema-registry) that discusses this, but a note in the official docs can be easier to discover for users that are looking for help with this issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it adds a section to the Apache Avro Data Source Guide\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually by inspecting generated docs\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe behavior of `StringToMap` expression accepts third and second parameters as regular expressions, as per the [docs](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.functions.str_to_map.html). For collated strings we handle regular expressions through collation aware regex flags with `java.regex`. In this PR the behavior for collated strings was adjusted to work with these flags - the current implementation is not regex-aware.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix a correctness issue with collated version of `StringToMap`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the collated behavior of `StringToMap` was changed. The following query returns different results:\r\n```sql\r\nselect str_to_map('a:b,c:d' collate utf8_lcase, ',', '[:]+')\r\n-- current behavior: Map('a:b,c:d' -> null)\r\n-- new behavior: Map('a' -> 'b', 'c' -> 'd')\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests in this PR and existing tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-24T17:31:57Z","updated_at":"2025-02-09T00:26:21Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48642/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48642/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48642/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0a0053bf18f88dba4f725ac474cc42317b677a7b","head":{"label":"stevomitric:stevomitric/fix-str-to-map","ref":"stevomitric/fix-str-to-map","sha":"0a0053bf18f88dba4f725ac474cc42317b677a7b","user":{"login":"stevomitric","id":16582560,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTgyNTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16582560?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric","html_url":"https://github.com/stevomitric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":768027483,"node_id":"R_kgDOLccrWw","name":"spark","full_name":"stevomitric/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stevomitric","id":16582560,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTgyNTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16582560?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric","html_url":"https://github.com/stevomitric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevomitric/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stevomitric/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nEnhance method verifyNotReadPath to identify subqueries hidden in the filter conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSparkSQL will throw exception if outputPath tries to overwrite inputpath. You can see the specific validation method 'verifyNotReadPath()' in the ddl.scala. SparkSQL can identify simple scenario such as:\r\n\r\n`insert overwrite table output_t select * from output_t;`\r\nHowever，SparkSQL cannot identify more complex scenarios where the subquery is hidden within filter conditions, such as：\r\n\r\n```\r\ninsert overwrite table output_t select * from input_t ta where not exists(select tb.id from output_t tb where tb.id = ta.id);\r\ninsert overwrite table output_t select * from input_t ta where ta.id in (select id from output_t );\r\ninsert overwrite table output_t select * from input_t ta where ta.id < (select max(tb.id) from output_t tb where tb.id=ta.id);\r\n```\r\nIn these scenarios above, SparkSQL throws an exception with the message 'java.io.FileNotFoundException: File does not exist' which can be confusing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. The aforementioned SQL will throw a more explicit exception with the message 'Can't overwrite a path that is also being read from'.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to upgrade the minimum version of `googleapis-common-protos` from 1.56.4 to 1.65.0 for Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`1.56.4` is too old (released on 2022-07-12) and incompatible with the last protobuf related libraries. We had better upgrade this to the latest versions in order to support the latest Python and protobuf versions in Apache Spark 4.0.0 on February 2025.\r\n\r\n-

change?\r\n\r\nNo behavior change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport for the optional “column” parameter has been added in box, kde, and hist plots. Now, when the column is not provided, all columns of valid types (NumericType, DateType, TimestampType) will be used to build the plots.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Reach parity with Pandas (on Spark) default behavior.\r\n- Simplify usage by reducing the need for explicitly specifying columns.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-10-24T02:08:10Z","updated_at":"2024-10-28T02:02:32Z","closed_at":"2024-10-28T02:02:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7215050f0e56ed7828e0e2a560c9fbc894bbccac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48628/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48628/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48628/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5b936f6ec8663163daeddc4cc67ad28af86e7815","head":{"label":"xinrong-meng:column_param","ref":"column_param","sha":"5b936f6ec8663163daeddc4cc67ad28af86e7815","user":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335786381,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3ODYzODE=","name":"spark","full_name":"xinrong-meng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds code to `RewritePredicateSubquery#apply` to explicitly handle the case where an `Aggregate` node contains an aggregate expression in the left-hand operand of an IN-subquery expression. The explicit handler moves the IN-subquery expressions out of the `Aggregate` and into a parent `Project` node. The `Aggregate` will continue to perform the aggregations that were used as an operand to the IN-subquery expression, but will not include the IN-subquery expression itself. After pulling up IN-subquery expressions into a Project node, `RewritePredicateSubquery#apply` is called again to handle the `Project` as a `UnaryNode`. The `Join` will now be inserted between the `Project` and the `Aggregate` node, and the join condition will use an attribute rather than an aggregate expression, e.g.:\r\n```\r\nProject [col1#32, exists#42 AS (sum(col2) IN (listquery()))#40]\r\n+- Join ExistenceJoin(exists#42), (sum(col2)#41L = c2#39L)\r\n   :- Aggregate [col1#32], [col1#32, sum(col2#33) AS sum(col2)#41L]\r\n   :  +- LocalRelation [col1#32, col2#33]\r\n   +- LocalRelation [c2#39L]\r\n```\r\n`sum(col2)#41L` in the above join condition, despite how it looks, is the name of the attribute, not an aggregate expression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe following query fails:\r\n```\r\ncreate or replace temp view v1(c1, c2) as values (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 7), (3, 1);\r\ncreate or replace temp view v2(col1, col2) as values (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 7), (3, 1);\r\n\r\nselect col1, sum(col2) in (select c2 from v1)\r\nfrom v2 group by col1;\r\n```\r\nIt fails with this error:\r\n```\r\n[INTERNAL_ERROR] Cannot generate code for expression: sum(input[1, int, false]) SQLSTATE: XX000\r\n```\r\nWith SPARK_TESTING=1, it fails with this error:\r\n```\r\n[PLAN_VALIDATION_FAILED_RULE_IN_BATCH] Rule org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.RewritePredicateSubquery in batch RewriteSubquery generated an invalid plan: Special expressions are placed in the wrong plan:\r\nAggregate [col1#11], [col1#11, first(exists#20, false) AS (sum(col2) IN (listquery()))#19]\r\n+- Join ExistenceJoin(exists#20), (sum(col2#12) = c2#18L)\r\n   :- LocalRelation [col1#11, col2#12]\r\n   +- LocalRelation [c2#18L]\r\n```\r\nThe issue is that `RewritePredicateSubquery` builds a `Join` operator where the join condition contains an aggregate expression.\r\n\r\nThe bug is in the handler for `UnaryNode` in `RewritePredicateSubquery#apply`, which adds a `Join` below the `Aggregate` and assumes that the left-hand operand of IN-subquery can be used in the join condition. This works fine for most cases, but not when the left-hand operand is an aggregate expression.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the offending IN-subqueries to a `Project` node, with the aggregates replaced by attributes referring to the aggregate expressions. The resulting join condition now uses those attributes rather than the actual aggregate expressions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, other than allowing this type of query to succeed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-23T19:22:08Z","updated_at":"2025-01-23T03:04:40Z","closed_at":"2025-01-23T03:03:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ac214eb08ac4cae2d765789c1ac36435c6604a70","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48627/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48627/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48627/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0e1c1706cb694368ac213616ab31cc5df68f6948","head":{"label":"bersprockets:aggregate_in_set_issue","ref":"aggregate_in_set_issue","sha":"0e1c1706cb694368ac213616ab31cc5df68f6948","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChanging the versions of the collations that use ICU to be that of the currently used ICU library in spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nChanging the version of the ICU library should automatically change the versions of collations that depend on it. Also, even though the UTF8_LCASE doesn't use ICU for comparisons it still relies on ICU's case mappings between upper and lower  case letters and is for that reason included as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded  new unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

This PR fixed the behaviour for PostgreSQL connector for multidimensional arrays since we have mapped all arrays to 1D arrays.\r\n\r\nThis PR has introduced a bug for one case. Following scenario is broken:\r\n\r\n- User has a table t1 on Postgres and does CTAS command to create table t2 with same data.\r\nPR 46006 is resolving the dimensionality of column by reading the metadata from pg_attribute table and attndims column.\r\n- This query returns correct dimensionality for table t1, but for table t2 that is created via CTAS it returns 0 always. This leads to all of the arrays being mapped to 0-D array which is the type itself (for example int). This is a bug on Postgres side.\r\n- As a solution, we can query array_ndims function on given column that will return the dimension of the column. It works for CTAS-like-created tables too. We can get the result of this function on first row of table. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is doing additional query to PG table to find the dimension of array column instead of querying metadata table as before. It might be more expensive but we are sending LIMIT 1 in query.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is one caveat. In PG, there is no dimensionality of array as all the arrays are 1D arrays (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/arrays.html#ARRAYS-DECLARATION). Therefore, if there is table with 2D array column, it is totally fine from PG side to insert 1D or 3D array in this column. This makes the read path on Spark problematic since we will get the dimension of array, for example 1 if the first record is 1D array, and then we will try to read 3D array later on which will fail. Vice versa also, getting dimension 3 and reading 1D array later on. The change that I propose is fine with this scenario since it already doesn't work in Spark. What my change implies is that user can get different error message depending on the dimensionality of first record in table (namely, for one table they can get the error message that the expected type is ARRAY<ARRAY<INT>> and for the other that it is ARRAY\\<INT\\>.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes to propagate the `isPredicate` info in `V2ExpressionBuilder` and wrap the children of CASE WHEN expression (only `Predicate`s) with `IIF(<>, 1, 0)` for MsSqlServer. This is done to force returning an int instead of a boolean, as SqlServer cannot handle boolean expressions as a return type in CASE WHEN.\r\n\r\nE.g.\r\n```CASE WHEN ... ELSE a = b END```\r\n\r\nOld behavior:\r\n```CASE WHEN ... ELSE a = b END = 1```\r\n\r\nNew behavior:\r\nSince in SqlServer a `= 1` is appended to the CASE WHEN, THEN and ELSE blocks must return an int. Therefore the final expression becomes:\r\n```CASE WHEN ... ELSE IIF(a = b, 1, 0) END = 1```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nA user cannot work with an MsSqlServer data with CASE WHEN clauses or IF clauses if they wish to return a boolean value.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to MsSqlServerIntegrationSuite\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-23T14:17:06Z","updated_at":"2024-11-21T12:57:08Z","closed_at":"2024-11-21T12:57:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6e7ac688f8fcc1620ed594212e5fd00009780b0f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48621/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48621/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48621/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bca7ce8e2d3cb472bc14f50f6a905e95f7c9934a","head":{"label":"andrej-db:SPARK-50087-CaseWhen","ref":"SPARK-50087-CaseWhen","sha":"bca7ce8e2d3cb472bc14f50f6a905e95f7c9934a","user":{"login":"andrej-db","id":159923197,"node_id":"U_kgDOCYg7_Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159923197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrej-db","html_url":"https://github.com/andrej-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrej-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrej-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrej-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrej-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrej-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrej-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrej-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrej-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrej-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":760417345,"node_id":"R_kgDOLVMMQQ","name":"spark","full_name":"andrej-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andrej-db","id":159923197,"node_id":"U_kgDOCYg7_Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159923197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrej-db","html_url":"https://github.com/andrej-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrej-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrej-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrej-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrej-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrej-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrej-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrej-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrej-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrej-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andrej-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR updates the suggested fix of `INVALID_URL` error to use `try_parse_url` function added in [this](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48500) PR instead of turning off ANSI mode. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nINVALID_URL contains suggested fix for turning off ANSI mode. Now that in Spark 4.0.0 we have moved to ANSI mode on by default, we want to keep suggestions of this kind to the minimum. There exist implementations of try_* functions which provide safe way to get behavior as for ANSI mode off and suggestions of this kind should be sufficient.\r\n\r\nIn this case, try expressions were missing so new expressions were added to patch up the missing implementations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThere are tests that check error messages. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMake `lit(ndarray)` with np.int8 respect the numpy datatype\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nthere was a py4j limitation so `NumpyArrayConverter` for Py4J converts `Array[Byte]` to `Array[Short]`, we should convert it back to `Array[Byte]` to respect the numpy datatype\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nbefore:\r\n```\r\nIn [8]: spark.range(1).select(sf.lit(np.int8(123)), sf.lit(np.array([1,2,3], np.int8)))\r\nOut[8]: DataFrame[123: tinyint, ARRAY(1S, 2S, 3S): array<smallint>]\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n```\r\nIn [3]: spark.range(1).select(sf.lit(np.int8(123)), sf.lit(np.array([1,2,3], np.int8)))\r\nOut[3]: DataFrame[123: tinyint, ARRAY(1S, 2S, 3S):

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nParquet's AdaptiveBlockSplitBloomFilter is a technique for generating a bloom filter with the optimal bit size according to the number of distinct real data values. It may not come at no cost because it uses multiple BloomFilter candidates at runtime, which could increase CPU usage or time. \r\n\r\nThis pull request adds benchmark cases to compare with those that use the default BloomFilter size.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprovement benchmark coverage for common user-orient features from parquet datasource\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nno\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nbenchmarking golden files attached \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce a new pattern object to extract BaseRelation and CatalogTable from LogicalRelation, and update existing pattern matches with LogicalRelation with the new pattern.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds the information of pattern object and encourage devs to use it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nI found it very difficult to add a param into LogicalRelation, because a bunch of places use pattern matching with LogicalRelation, and all of them are using default pattern with specifying all params (despite wildcards).\r\n\r\nI looked into the patterns and realized most of the patterns just need relation and catalog table inside the LogicalRelation. output and isStreaming are used infrequently. That said, introducing a new pattern object extracting BaseRelation and CatalogTable from LogicalRelation would cover most of the patterns we have for LogicalRelation, and this would help a lot to introduce a new param into LogicalRelation in future.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nN/A (Existing tests would cover it)\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-10-22T22:31:16Z","updated_at":"2024-10-24T10:32:35Z","closed_at":"2024-10-24T10:32:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e2fa9e4aa0508e580ebc7d93ec8976739813fdb9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, we use UnsafeRow to store all state in the StateStores. This change will add StateStore APIs that support byte array operations on the StateStore, and to enable Avro encoding to be used for the TransformWithState operator via SQLConf, only for ValueState. Subsequent state variable types will be supported in future PRs. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nUnsafeRow is an inherently unstable format that makes no guarantees of being backwards-compatible. Therefore, if the format changes between Spark releases, this could cause StateStore corruptions. Avro is more stable, and inherently enables schema evolution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAmended and added to unit tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to extend the `InSet` expression, and support collated string columns:\r\n- If the string type supports binary equality like for the collation `UTF8_BINARY`, just follow the existing implementation and use regular `Set`\r\n- In the case of the `STRING` type w/ non-`UTF8_BINARY` collation, `InSet` uses new class `InSet.CollationAwareSet` which provides the `Set[UTF8String]` partially. It implements the `contains()` method but not others. The class preprocesses the input set of `UTF8String` by calculating collation keys, put them to new set. The `contains()` method also calculates a collation key over the input `elem` before checking it existence in the set.\r\n- In other cases including nested collated strings, `InSet` uses `TreeSet` with interpreted ordering instance `Ordering` which respects collations of the `STRING` type.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSince the `InSet` expression is used internally in a few places like in Dynamic Partition Pruning, the changes will extend usage of collated string columns. Currently, `InSet` doesn't distinguish any collations and can return wrong results.  \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *CollationExpressionSuite\"\r\n```\r\nwhich checks:\r\n- the `STRING` type w/ `UTF8_BINARY`, `UTF8_LCASE` and `UTF8_BINARY_RTRIM` collations\r\n- ARRAY of `STRING` w/ the same collation as above\r\n- mixed collated string in `MAP` of `STRING`\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-10-22T11:22:47Z","updated_at":"2024-10-24T12:58:28Z","closed_at":"2024-10-24T12:58:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"35e9895fc04bd67b1a96a419b53df973871b48d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"stefankandic","id":154237371,"node_id":"U_kgDOCTF5uw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154237371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic","html_url":"https://github.com/stefankandic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"uros-db","id":157381213,"node_id":"U_kgDOCWFyXQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157381213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db","html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48598/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48598/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48598/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c0a182281a0972c69db33f70284cf4bb0f607763","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:collation-InSet","ref":"collation-InSet","sha":"c0a182281a0972c69db33f70284cf4bb0f607763","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposed a refactor to `TypeCoercion` rule in order to separate logic for transformation of a single node into separate files. Refactor is doing the following:\r\n\r\n- Split the interface `TypeCoercionBase` into `TypeCoercionBase` and `TypeCoercionHelper` in separate abstract classes\r\n- `TypeCoercionHelper` contains declarations of all utility virtual methods  that are later overriden in `TypeCoercion` and `AnsiTypeCoercion` \r\n- `transform` methods that rely on these virtual methods are refactored so that the check whether children have been resolved remains as is while other match cases are refactored and moved into separate objects inside `TypeCoercionHelper`\r\n- `transform` methods that don't depend on these virtual methods are refactored to separate files in a similar manner to previous point\r\n- In cases where check whether the children are resolved is wrapped into another case, that case is split into 2 cases: one that checks children and one that does the other check\r\n- All type coercion rules shared between `TypeCoercion` and `AnsiTypeCoercion`  remain in `TypeCoercionBase`. \r\n- `TypeCoercionBase` inherits `TypeCoercionHelper`\r\n- `TypeCoercion` and `AnsiTypeCoercion` inherit `TypeCoercionBase`\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't refactor type coercion rules that don't have a separate `transform` method but traverse the tree from their apply method. This will be done in a separate PRs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nRefactoring to support `Analyzer++` effort\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

reverts commit 0705e102292323551b3f6dfbb7edabc06d31ceb3.\r\n\r\nRationale: \r\n@hvanhovell helped to clarify the semantic of the API - it should capture the data itself and not just evaluating against flowing inputs. For example, suppose the query `df.observe(\"name\", count(lit(1)).as(\"rc\")).filter(false)`, the intention of the API is to \"rc\" to have 4 if there are 4 rows in df, regardless whether the 4 rows will be soon discarded. The commit 0705e102292323551b3f6dfbb7edabc06d31ceb3 is against this.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if we lost the node due to optimization, users wouldn't know whether Spark somehow dropped the node hence metric is not available, with the commit 0705e102292323551b3f6dfbb7edabc06d31ceb3. Before the commit, users may encounter the issue with unavailability of the metric they just registered, but that is at least playing as distinguishing the case of node loss vs no input.","created_at":"2024-10-22T03:18:44Z","updated_at":"2024-10-24T00:54:50Z","closed_at":"2024-10-24T00:54:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ad8c70be8934ba45c3b084fad0530645d7fd8965","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this PR the `analyze table` command is enabled for collated strings. Current implementation collects stats based on the collation-aware `Aggregate` expression, so this PR only enables the aggregation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo enable `analyze table` command for collated strings.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, currently doing:\r\n```sql\r\nANALYZE TABLE test_table COMPUTE STATISTICS FOR COLUMNS c\r\n```\r\nwhere c is collated string, fails because of unsupported datatype. This PR addresses this issue and enables the command.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew test in this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport histogram plots with plotly backend on both Spark Connect and Spark classic.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhile Pandas on Spark supports plotting, PySpark currently lacks this feature. The proposed API will enable users to generate visualizations. This will provide users with an intuitive, interactive way to explore and understand large datasets directly from PySpark DataFrames, streamlining the data analysis workflow in distributed environments.\r\n\r\nSee more at [PySpark Plotting API Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IjOEzC8zcetG86WDvqkereQPj_NGLNW7Bdu910g30Dg/edit?usp=sharing) in progress.\r\n\r\nPart of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-49530.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use stable order of EventTimeWatermark node (instead of traversal order) to calculate watermark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWatermarkTracker only looks at the physical plan during calculation of the new watermark value. It determines the watermark node by index, hence we have various issues when the watermark node is lost on the optimization phase.\r\n\r\n1) watermark advancement is made even there is one node to be dropped (should be considered as no data from that node, hence should not advance the watermark)\r\n2) watermark tracker incorrectly update the memory map of the previous value of watermark node (index is not a stable key, but used to update the map)\r\n\r\nNew UT describes what is the expectation of the behavior and how it was broken before this PR.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UT.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-21T02:19:36Z","updated_at":"2024-10-26T19:08:26Z","closed_at":"2024-10-26T02:52:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fc33155e114f0d0a6884bae3c8fc4302b729d433","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

To support this mode in Spark, spark need to allow the Executor to be launched using a random BlockManager port. And prohibit shuffle local read, as this will cause the shuffle to be read failed.\r\n\r\nadd two conf:\r\n- spark.shuffle.load.read.enable\r\n- spark.kubernetes.executor.random.blockManager\r\n\r\nwhen run spark with executor hostnetwork, it need to set as \r\n- spark.shuffle.load.read.enable = false\r\n- spark.kubernetes.executor.random.blockManager = true\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen I compiled the spark-core module in the windows environment, the bash/powershell program could not be executed because my operating system had WSL installed, and the build information file was not generated in the spark-core jar. When I used this jar for verification, I found that the jar was not working properly as the build information was not present.\r\n\r\nTherefore, building should be stopped when Antrun script fails.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on my previous statement,  I think when the antrun script in spark-core module fails, the build progress should be ended immediately, otherwise the builded `spark-core.jar` will not work properly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSince it does not change the existing behavior and only covers abnormal scenarios, it is tested manually locally.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMake 'randstr' and 'uniform' deterministic in Scala Client\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe need to explicitly set the seed in connect clients, to avoid making the output dataframe non-deterministic (see https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/14ba4fc479155611ca39bda6f879c34cc78af2ee)\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48143, I requested the author to set the seed in python client.\r\nBut at that time, I was not aware of the fact that Spark Connect Scala Client was reusing the same `functions.scala` under `org.apache.spark.sql`. (There were two different files before)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the two functions may cause non-deterministic issues like:\r\n```\r\nscala> val df = spark.range(10).select(randstr(lit(10)).as(\"r\"))\r\nUsing Spark's default log4j profile: org/apache/spark/log4j2-pattern-layout-defaults.properties\r\ndf: org.apache.spark.sql.package.DataFrame = [r: string]\r\n\r\nscala> df.show()\r\n+----------+\r\n|
