trying to use the `RenderRunner`, I came across a few warts.\r\n- It accepts a pipeline proto but doesn't use `run_portable_pipeline`\r\n- Not 100% sure about this but it used `dotX` instead of `dot` for one of its subprocess calls\r\n- `RenderOptions` couldn't be used with `.view_as` because the init-time validation\r\n- The `RenderRunner` logging used the root logger instead of the module logger\r\n\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[![Build python source

href=\"https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases\">numpy's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.26.0</h2>\n<h1>NumPy 1.26.0 Release Notes</h1>\n<p>The NumPy 1.26.0 release is a continuation of the 1.25.x release cycle\nwith the addition of Python 3.12.0 support. Python 3.12 dropped\ndistutils, consequently supporting it required finding a replacement for\nthe setup.py/distutils based build system NumPy was using. We have\nchosen to use the Meson build system instead, and this is the first\nNumPy release supporting it. This is also the first release that\nsupports Cython 3.0 in addition to retaining 0.29.X compatibility.\nSupporting those two upgrades was a large project, over 100 files have\nbeen touched in this release. The changelog doesn't capture the full\nextent of the work, special thanks to Ralf Gommers, Sayed Adel, Stéfan\nvan der Walt, and Matti Picus who did much of the work in the main\ndevelopment branch.</p>\n<p>The highlights of this release are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Python 3.12.0 support.</li>\n<li>Cython 3.0.0 compatibility.</li>\n<li>Use of the Meson build system</li>\n<li>Updated SIMD support</li>\n<li>f2py fixes, meson and bind(x) support</li>\n<li>Support for the updated Accelerate BLAS/LAPACK library</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Python versions supported in this release are 3.9-3.12.</p>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<h3>Array API v2022.12 support in <code>numpy.array_api</code></h3>\n<p><code>numpy.array_api</code> now full supports the\n<a href=\"https://data-apis.org/array-api/2022.12\">v2022.12 version</a> of the array API standard.  Note that this does not\nyet include the optional <code>fft</code> extension in the standard.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23789\">gh-23789</a>)</p>\n<h3>Support for the updated Accelerate BLAS/LAPACK library</h3>\n<p>Support for the updated Accelerate BLAS/LAPACK library, including ILP64\n(64-bit integer) support, in macOS 13.3 has been added. This brings\narm64 support, and significant performance improvements of up to 10x for\ncommonly used linear algebra operations. When Accelerate is selected at\nbuild time, the 13.3+ version will automatically be used if available.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/24053\">gh-24053</a>)</p>\n<h3><code>meson</code> backend for <code>f2py</code></h3>\n<p><code>f2py</code> in compile mode (i.e. <code>f2py -c</code>) now accepts the</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

somehow you have an annotation(s) on a `CombinePerKey` transform (e.g. because you subclass it and add annotations or a runner adds annotations), the annotations end up disappearing after getting translated by `lifted_stages`. \r\n\r\nConsiderations:\r\n----------------\r\nI don't think it's super obvious what the correct behavior is here. It's a bit surprising the annotation disappears but it may also be surprising for someone who meant to signal some behavior for one transform to suddenly have it for the four resulting component transforms. I put up this PR in case it does make sense to propagate the annotations since for our use case it simplifies things a lot\r\n\r\nContext:\r\n--------\r\nWe're writing a runner and we'd like to be able to save the top level user labels that users assign to their transforms so we can nicely log which user transform is being run at every phase. The most obvious way to me to do this was to create some custom annotations and then search for them at phase execution time. I was surprised when the CPK annotations were missing. Open to other ways to do this though\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master

a github action precommit for the standalone prism runner. Standalone prism uses job specified environments (usually docker containers), by default.\r\n\r\n* Updates the go run_validates_runner.sh test script. Ensure prism binary shuts down and cleans up afterwards. \r\n* Add gradle actions to invoke script as the prism runner.\r\n* Add github action workflow to trigger as precommit. Copied from the GoPortable precommit workflow. https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/.github/workflows/beam_PreCommit_GoPortable.yml\r\n* Check for docker manifest for image to avoid pull failures for unpushed images.\r\n* Plumb Pipeline options through to workers for container provisioning.\r\n* Filter out Xlang tests for prism, since it's not yet capable of them.\r\n* Make prism use loopback mode by default for in-process servers, not if endpoint is overridden, which uses job default (docker).\r\n* Add flags to standalone prism to specify Web UI and Job Management ports.\r\n\r\nPart of https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/28187\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

torch is added to `autodoc_mock_import`, when importing transformers it throws an error when importing `from transformers import Pipeline`. In one of the steps it checks the `torch.__version__`. Since this turns out to be None, the transformer import throws an error. This PR adds transformers to `autodoc_mock_import` as well and unpin transformers version.\r\n\r\nFixes #28104 \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

will be used to consume GetWorkerMetadata response and updates.\r\n\r\nIt exposes a separate read and write interface.  The write interface will be used for the caller of GetWorkerMetadata stream to be able to pass the response along to the cache to consume.  The read interface will be vended out to GetWorkStream, GetDataStream, and CommitWorkStream call sites in order to fetch connections directly to Streaming Engine Windmill Workers, or the Dispatcher.\r\n\r\nWindmillConnectionCacheTokens will be used to attach to WorkItems to correctly call GetDataStream and CommitWorkStream.  \r\n\r\nSince the WindmillConnectionsCache's will be shared, it uses AtomicReference and synchronization around writes to the cache.  Updates are all or nothing and done under a lock/synchronization, and reads fetch a snapshot of the of the AtomicReference's value to serve reads without locking.\r\n\r\nr: @scwhittle \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
