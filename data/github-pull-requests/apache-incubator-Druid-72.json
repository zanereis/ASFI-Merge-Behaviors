Description\r\nI had originally submitted a pull request that allowed for custom Kafka deserializers to be used with the Kafka indexing service.  After that merge completed, I noticed that in the data-ingest UI for Kafka in the new console, the Kafka sampler was still hard-coded with the ByteArrayDeserializer, so I have additionally removed the hard-coded value such that if the user does not supply a custom deserializer, the \"old\" behavior will still apply (e.g. default to ByteArrayDeserializer), but if the user specifies a custom deserializer in the consumer properties, it will be honored.\r\n\r\n# Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n *

ZooKeeper's getACL() command doesn't check any permission when retrieves the ACLs of the requested node and returns all information contained in the ACL Id field as plaintext string. DigestAuthenticationProvider overloads the Id field with the hash value that is used for user authentication. As a consequence, if Digest Authentication is in use, the unsalted hash value will be disclosed by getACL() request for unauthenticated or unprivileged users.\r\n\r\nand has a critical [bug](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2960).\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code?

Description\r\n\r\nIn keeping with previous work to enable the use of custom Kafka Deserializers for data ingest into Druid, I noticed that in the Web-UI, the Kafka Deserializer is also hard-coded as ByteArrayDeserializer, thus clicking the \"preview\" button for Kafka topics that use a custom Deserializer would not work properly in the Web-UI wizard.\r\n\r\nIn order to fix this behavior, I removed the hard-coded deserializer in KafkaSamplerSpec so that it reads the deserializer from the consumer config provided in the UI or defaults to the ByteArrayDeserializer if one is not supplied, thus there is no need to change user behavior, they can continue to use the Web-UI Kafka data importer just like before, but can also specify a custom deserializer if desired.","created_at":"2019-08-21T16:19:25Z","updated_at":"2019-08-21T16:25:34Z","closed_at":"2019-08-21T16:25:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cc4ecc0d1ad5f659683bf2c892a2c8eb78772946","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/8360/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/8360/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8360/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/95742dbdbf8ca4bf07923229802004fa7bd805f7","head":{"label":"abossert:feature-custom-kafka-deserializers","ref":"feature-custom-kafka-deserializers","sha":"95742dbdbf8ca4bf07923229802004fa7bd805f7","user":{"login":"abossert","id":25932500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTMyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25932500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abossert","html_url":"https://github.com/abossert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abossert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abossert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abossert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abossert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abossert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abossert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abossert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abossert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abossert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d00747774208dbbfcb272ee7d1c30cf879887838","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":6358188,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzU4MTg4","name":"druid","full_name":"apache/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid","description":"Apache

Description\r\n\r\n- In native parallel indexing, the shuffle didn't work if TLS is enabled because it didn't use the escalated http client. This PR fixes `PartialSegmentMergeTask` to use the escalated client. \r\n- `FullResponseHolder` and `BytesFullResponseHolder` were refactored to remove the existing strange inheritance relation.\r\n- Improved `MultiPhaseParallelIndexingTest` to verify that the created segments are well partitioned.\r\n- Added an integration test for native parallel indexing with shuffle.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue with scan queries introduced by #8157, which I believe is caused by variation in JSON serde of the response context, and switches `NUM_SCANNED_ROWS` and

#8338.\r\n\r\nI'm not hugely experienced with maven but it looks like by marking the client-core dependency as provided in indexing-service it's being skipped over in hdfs-storage (when hadoop-client actually needs it). \r\n\r\nThis PR removes references to hadoop-client-core that were introduced in #6828 and bumps the scope of hadoop-client in the indexing-service so that each submodule is depending on the same thing.\r\n\r\nOpen to alternatives if anyone with more expertise in maven knows a better fix.\r\n\r\nInitial testing looks like this fixes the issue but currently getting this to deployed to our test cluster and will update with results.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Deployed on our test cluster, hadoop batch indexing seems to be working again with this change.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR

#8148 \r\n\r\nSame as #8243 but for long/float min/max/sum aggregators\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis patch adds handling of single/multi value column handling by long/float sum/min/max aggregators to do a best effort parsing string as long/float.\r\n\r\n`StringColumn[Long/Float]AggregatorWrapper` and `StringColumn[Long/Float]BufferAggregatorWrapper` classes are introduced that can wrap existing long/float aggregators to handle string columns. Both of the classes are used by `Simple[Long/Float]AggregatorFactory` to be used when input column is known to be of String type.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code

description:\r\nThe issue8291 is submitted by my colleague. It will cause ReferenceCountingSegment only invoke _**increase()**_ but do not invoke _**decrease()**_ correspondly. Then _**getNumReferences()**_ will keep increasing and  meet 65535 limit. Finally it will throw exception and cause all query fail.\r\n\r\nRoot reason:\r\nThe problem only happens when useCache=true in both middle manager node setting and query context. And cache type & cache strategy should meet some requirement also.\r\nIn this scenario, actually SinkQuerySegmentWalker will use CachingQueryRunner for querying. As designed, it will invoke decrease() after the background queryRunner.run() is invoked. All looks perfect.\r\nBut when useCache=true, CachingQueryRunner just retrieve query result from cache directly and  queryRunner.run() is NOT invoked really. Then of course decrease() will not be invoked also. It is a problem.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nmake sure decrease() will be invoked in any case.\r\n\r\nHow we make it in pull request:\r\n1、add one protected EMPTY close() in useCache=true statement of CachingQueryRunner， then it will not impact other features which still use CachingQueryRunner.\r\n2、add CloseableCachingQueryRunner to extend CachingQueryRunner. It will accept one extra Closeable parameter in constructor.\r\n3、overwrite close() in CloseableCachingQueryRunner, in which it will use Closeable to invoke decrease().\r\n4、use CloseableCachingQueryRunner to replace CachingQueryRunner in SinkQuerySegmentWalker

TL;DR\r\n\r\nA refresh of the documentation done in collaboration with @vogievetsky.\r\n\r\nCheck out a render at: https://staging-druid.imply.io/docs/design/\r\n\r\nAnd compare to the current doc pages: https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/design/\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis refresh has two main goals.\r\n\r\nFirst, setting up **Docusaurus**:\r\n\r\n1. Use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a really nice documentation generator that creates much more beautiful pages than we have now. They are also more functional; each one has a left-hand collapsible table of contents showing the outline of the overall docs, and a right-hand table of contents showing the outline of that particular doc page. Compare to the old doc pages, where there's only one non-collapsible ToC, and it's grown so long that it's quite difficult to follow.\r\n2. Make various titles and headers more consistent. The inconsistencies have been around for a while, but became much easier to notice with the new Docusaurus ToCs.\r\n\r\nSecond, an **ingestion doc refresh**:\r\n\r\n1. Includes a new `ingestion/index.md` doc that introduces all the key ingestion spec concepts, and describes the most popular ingestion methods. It is meant to be an introduction to the world of Druid ingestion.\r\n2. Consolidate lots of disparate ingestion docs, which have grown organically over time and have become difficult to follow, into a simpler set of fewer, larger, more cross-referenced pages. Check out the new pages at: https://staging-druid.imply.io/docs/ingestion/index.html. Some prime examples of this consolidation are the new pages `ingestion/data-management.md` and `ingestion-tasks.md`, which represent multiple pages from the current set of docs.\r\n3. Have a bit more 'opinionatedness' in the ingestion pages, pushing new people towards Kafka, Kinesis, Hadoop, and native batch ingestion. They discuss Tranquility but don't present it as something highly recommended (in keeping with its status as something that doesn't get a lot of love these days). And the few remaining references to Realtime Nodes have been redirected to a page that says they're gone now.\r\n\r\n### Other notes\r\n\r\nI think we need to restore some of the `_bin` scripts that are still useful (but which ones?).","created_at":"2019-08-15T07:38:30Z","updated_at":"2019-08-23T22:01:27Z","closed_at":"2019-08-21T04:49:00Z","merged_at":"2019-08-21T04:49:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"d00747774208dbbfcb272ee7d1c30cf879887838","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

Description\r\nThis PR migrates binary `NOTICE` entries to live in `licenses.yaml`, and adds a new script, `docs/_bin/generate-notice-binary.py` that uses `licenses.yaml` and `NOTICE` to generate

Adapted from `generate-license.py`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ distribution/bin/generate-notice-binary.py NOTICE licenses.yaml NOTICE.BINARY\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should make maintaining the notice file a bit easier, but this PR doesn't include anything to automatically check that everything that needs a notice has one in here, so we will still need to manually make sure the `notice` or `notices` are set for a dependency for now.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, all scripts related to performing releases have been moved into `distribution/bin` from `docs/_bin`.","created_at":"2019-08-15T01:03:38Z","updated_at":"2019-08-21T19:46:31Z","closed_at":"2019-08-21T19:46:28Z","merged_at":"2019-08-21T19:46:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"010f70b3710fcbeb7cbed2617a3701ce925c79dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":950723510,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NTA3MjM1MTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Apache","name":"Apache","color":"f7c6c7","default":false,"description":"Items

commit adds support for incremental load in druid lookups. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nFor larger lookups with millions of rows, reloading of the lookup is very hard on the JVM due to GC pressure. After this change, during reload, only entries that were modified after the last db update would be added to the same underlying cache object.\r\nFunnily enough, Druid docs say that this feature is already supported in Druid but that wasn't the case.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\nIn JdbcCacheGenerator, only read newly modified rows from the Database. \r\nin CacheScheduler, added new method createFromExistingCache to add cache entries to the same underlying cache.\r\nadditions to NamespaceExtractionCacheManager interface for creating new cache object from the same underlying ConcurrentMap.\r\n\r\ncurrent limitations: \r\n1. incremental load is not supported for OffHeap lookups\r\n2. Does not handle the deletes from the DB.\r\n\r\nWe at Twitter have been using these changes for more than few months now and the performance of lookup reload has been significantly better.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n *

of https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/8061.\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/8236.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for parallel native indexing with shuffle for perfect rollup.\r\n\r\n#### New configurations in `tuningConfig` for parallel index task:\r\n\r\n- `forceGuaranteedRollup`: parallel indexing is executed in two phases with shuffle if this is set.\r\n- `maxNumSegmentsToMerge`: Max limit for the number of segments that a single task can merge at the same time in the second phase. Used only `forceGuaranteedRollup` is set.\r\n- `totalNumMergeTasks`: Total number of tasks to merge segments in the second phase when `forceGuaranteedRollup` is set.\r\n\r\n#### Refactoring\r\n\r\n- `FiniteFirehoseProcessor` is added to share the duplicate codes to process a firehose\r\n- `ParallelIndexPhaseRunner` is added to share the duplicate codes in the implementations of ParallelIndexTaskRunner\r\n- Added `SubTaskReport` interface to support different types of subtask reports\r\n\r\n#### Multi-phase indexing\r\n\r\nIf `forceGuaranteedRollup` is set, `ParallelIndexSupervisorTask` runs `PartialSegmentGenerateParallelIndexTaskRunner` and `PartialSegmentMergeParallelIndexTaskRunner` for the first and second phases, respectively. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n  - tested by ingesting the

#8217 .\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nImplement a TrustedDomainAuthenticator which allows traffic from pre-configured domain, Ip address to pass.\r\nConfigurable properties for the authenticator -\r\n\r\nImplement a `TrustedDomainAuthenticator` which allows traffic from pre-configured domain, Ip address to pass. \r\n\r\nConfigurable properties for the authenticator - \r\n* `druid.authenticator.<authenticator_name>.domain` (`required` =  `true`): trusted domain name or IP address, Authentication will be skipped for any connection coming from a host whose hostname ends with this domain name. If authentication is expected to be skipped for connections from only a given host, fully qualified hostname of that host needs to be specified.\r\n\r\n* `druid.authenticator.<authenticator_name>.useForwardedHeaders` : (`default`= `false`, `required` =  `false`) When trusted domain authentication is enabled, the clients connecting to druid could pass through many layers of proxy. Some proxies also append its own ip address to 'X-Forwarded-For' header before passing on the request to another proxy. Some proxies also connect on behalf of client. if this config is set to true and if 'X-Forwarded-For' is present, trusted domain authenticator will use left most ip address from X-Forwarded-For header.\r\n\r\n* `druid.authenticator.<authenticator_name>.identity` (`required` =  `true`) - The identity of the requester. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code
