(#8469)\r\n\r\nIn KAFKA-9826, a log whose first dirty offset was past the start of the active segment and past the last cleaned point resulted in an endless cycle of picking the segment to clean and discarding it. Though this didn't interfere with cleaning other log segments, it kept the log cleaner thread continuously busy (potentially wasting CPU and impacting other running threads) and filled the logs with lots of extraneous messages.\r\n\r\nThis was determined to be because the active segment was getting mistakenly picked for cleaning, and because the logSegments code handles (start == end) cases only for (start, end) on a segment boundary: the intent is to return a null list, but if they're not on a segment boundary, the routine returns that segment.\r\n\r\nThis fix has two parts:\r\n\r\nIt changes logSegments to handle start==end by returning an empty List always.\r\n\r\nIt changes the definition of calculateCleanableBytes to not consider anything past the UncleanableOffset; previously, it would potentially shift the UncleanableOffset to match the firstDirtyOffset even if the firstDirtyOffset was past the firstUncleanableOffset. This has no real effect now in the context of the fix for (1) but it makes the code read more like the model that the code is attempting to follow.\r\n\r\nThese changes require modifications to a few test cases that handled this particular test case; they were introduced in the context of KAFKA-8764. Those situations are now handled elsewhere in code, but the tests themselves allowed a DirtyOffset in the active segment, and expected an active segment to be selected for cleaning.\r\n\r\nReviewer: Jun Rao <junrao@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

should fix the flaky `GlobalKTableIntegrationTest.shouldRestoreGlobalInMemoryKTableOnRestart` as well as address the issue on the ticket (avoid unnecessary group coordination overhead).\r\n\r\nThe deeper issue (and root cause of the test's flakiness) is that currently every StreamThread in a global-only topology will hit IllegalStateException upon trying to poll. Once they all died, the KafkaStreams instance goes into the ERROR state despite the global thread being alive and well. \r\n\r\nThe fix is to check whether the topology is global-only and overwrite the num.threads to 0 in that case. This PR also adds a check for topologies with nothing whatsoever, and throws an exception to fail fast.\r\n\r\nedit: turns out this patch also happens to fix a regression introduced in 2.5, when we switched over to using collection subscription (for which an empty subscription is illegal) from the previous pattern subscription (for which an empty subscription is mysteriously considered fine). **This should be cherrypicked back to 2.5**

the Connect worker forwards a REST API request to the leader, it might get back a `RequestTargetException` that suggests the worker should forward the request to a different worker. This can happen when the leader changes, and the worker that receives the original request forwards the request to the worker that it thinks is the current leader, but that worker is not the current leader. In this case. In most cases, the worker that received the forwarded request includes the URL of the current leader, but it is possible (albeit rare) that the worker doesn’t know the current leader and will include a null leader URL in the resulting `RequestTargetException`.\r\n\r\nWhen this rare case happens, the user gets a null pointer exception in their response and the NPE is logged. Instead, the worker should catch this condition and provide a more useful error message that is similar to other existing error messages that might occur.\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test that verifies this corner case is caught and this particular NPE does not occur.\r\n\r\nI recommend this be backported a few branches, as is typical for bug fixes.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

debugging KAFKA-9388, I found the reason that the second test method test takes much longer (10s) than the previous one (~500ms) is because they used the same app.id. When the previous clients are shutdown, they would not send leave-group and hence we are still depending on the session timeout (10s) for the members to be removed out of the group.\r\n\r\nWhen the second test is triggered, they will join the same group because of the same application id, and the `prepare-rebalance` phase would would for the full rebalance timeout before it kicks out the previous members.\r\n\r\nSetting different application ids could resolve such issues for integration tests --- I did a quick search and found some other integration tests have the same issue. And after this PR my local unit test runtime reduced from about 14min to 7min.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

PR updates the algorithm which limits the number of members within a group (`group.max.size`) to fix the following two issues:\r\n1. As described in KAFKA-9885, we found out that multiple members of a group can be evicted if the leader of the consumer offset partition changes before the group is persisted. This happens because the current evection logic always evict the first member rejoining the group.\r\n2. We also found out that dynamic members, when required to have a known member id, are not always limited. The caveat is that the current logic only considers unknown members and uses the group size, which does not include the so called pending members, to accept or reject a member. In this case, when they rejoins, they are not unknown member anymore and thus could bypass the limit. See `testDynamicMembersJoinGroupWithMaxSizeAndRequiredKnownMember` for the whole scenario.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the logic to address the above two issues and extends the tests coverage to cover all the member types.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-21T09:09:08Z","updated_at":"2020-10-06T20:10:00Z","closed_at":"2020-04-27T21:43:30Z","merged_at":"2020-04-27T21:43:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"c5d13dcb6ca2a7564cb5b707941b7c68d3de9289","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8525/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8525/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8525/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/9f34d60a5a7d9141c6b0a8219e59922e327021e5","head":{"label":"dajac:KAFKA-9885","ref":"KAFKA-9885","sha":"9f34d60a5a7d9141c6b0a8219e59922e327021e5","user":{"login":"dajac","id":157182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac","html_url":"https://github.com/dajac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40044750,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDA0NDc1MA==","name":"kafka","full_name":"dajac/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dajac","id":157182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac","html_url":"https://github.com/dajac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dajac/kafka","description":"Mirror

changes made in [KIP-454](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-454%3A+Expansion+of+the+ConnectClusterState+interface) involved adding a `connectorConfig` method to the [ConnectClusterState](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/ecde596180975f8546c0e8e10f77f7eee5f1c4d8/connect/api/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/health/ConnectClusterState.java) interface that REST extensions could use to query the worker for the configuration of a given connector. The implementation for this method returns the Java `Map` that's stored in the worker's view of the config topic (when running in distributed mode). No copying is performed, which causes mutations of that `Map` object to persist across invocations of `connectorConfig` and, even worse, propagate to the worker when, e.g., starting a connector.\r\n\r\nThe changes here just cause the framework to copy that map before sending it to REST extensions, and alter a comment in `KafkaConfigBackingStore` that addresses the mutability of the snapshots that it provides to warn against changes that may lead to bugs like this one.\r\n\r\nAn existing unit test is modified to ensure that REST extensions receive a copy of the connector config, not the original.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-18T05:31:20Z","updated_at":"2021-06-13T22:22:34Z","closed_at":"2020-05-23T22:35:44Z","merged_at":"2020-05-23T22:35:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"40ee580ed23c876dec45eca4770e834d9aed76da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8511/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8511/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8511/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/daa86fc1ee40440ee516f6377f536dd4c53f5ad3","head":{"label":"C0urante:kafka-9888","ref":"kafka-9888","sha":"daa86fc1ee40440ee516f6377f536dd4c53f5ad3","user":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83460713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQ2MDcxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"C0urante/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante/kafka","description":"Mirror

However, there is no guarantee that the broker would receive the latest broker epoch before the controller: When the broker registers with ZK, there are few more instructions to process before this broker \"knows\" about its epoch, while the controller may already get notified and send UPDATE_METADATA request (as an example) with the new epoch.

performing a join with a stream that needs repartitioning, Kafka Streams automatically creates a repartition topic.  If the user does not use `StreamJoined` to name to repartition topic, Kafka Streams uses the generated name of the KStream instance for the repartition topic name.  \r\n\r\nIf the KStream instance requiring the repartition participates in another join, the second repartition topic is created using the name of the operator. This name reuse is what causes the `InvalidTopologyException.`  The error occurs because the `InternalTopologyBuilder` has already registered the repartition source name previously.\r\n\r\nFor example, this topology will cause an error because Kafka Streams will attempt to create two repartition topics (which is correct behavior) but using the _**same name**_ each time which causes the error.\r\n``` java\r\nKStream<String, String> newStream = stream1.map((k, v) -> new KeyValue<>(v, k));\r\nnewStream.join(stream2, (value1, value2) -> value1 + value2, JoinWindows.of(ofMillis(100))).to(\"out-one\");\r\n// using newStream in another join here causes the error\r\nnewStream.join(stream3, (value1, value2) -> value1 + value2, JoinWindows.of(ofMillis(100))).to(\"out-to\");\r\n```\r\nHowever this topology, which is the same except the user has provided repartition topic names, is fine.  Note the use of `StreamJoined.withName` here\r\n```java\r\nKStream<String, String> newStream = stream1.map((k, v) -> new KeyValue<>(v, k));\r\nfinal StreamJoined<String, String, String> streamJoined = StreamJoined.with(Serdes.String(), Serdes.String(), Serdes.String());\r\nnewStream.join(stream2, (value1, value2) -> value1 + value2, JoinWindows.of(ofMillis(100)), streamJoined.withName(\"first-join\")).to(\"out-one\");\r\n// using newStream in another join here is fine because the name of the repartition topic is unique\r\nnewStream.join(stream3, (value1, value2) -> value1 + value2, JoinWindows.of(ofMillis(100)), streamJoined.withName(\"second-join\")).to(\"out-two\");\r\n```\r\nThis bug has been present for some time as I tested this out on `2.0` before we added the optimization layer.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the fix should be to generate a repartition topic name each time to avoid such issues.  But IMHO that ship has already sailed because by introducing a new name generation will cause compatibility issues for existing topologies.  So generating new names is out for now, at least.\r\n\r\nThe proposed fix is:\r\n\r\n1.  For KStream objects needing repartitioning _**and  using generated names**_, reuse the repartition topic node in any additional joins.\r\n2. For KStream instances needing repartitioning _**using user-provided names**_ always create a new repartition topic node for each join as each one will have a unique name\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI've added tests confirming the expected behavior.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n-

integration test RocksDBMetricsIntegrationTest takes pretty long to complete.\r\nMost of the runtime is spent in the two tests that verify whether the RocksDB\r\nmetrics get actual measurements from RocksDB. Those tests need to wait for the thread\r\nthat collects the measurements of the RocksDB metrics to trigger the first recordings\r\nof the metrics.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a unit test that verifies whether the Kafka Streams metrics get the\r\nmeasurements from RocksDB and removes the two integration tests that verified it\r\nbefore. The verification of the creation and scheduling of the RocksDB metrics\r\nrecording trigger thread is already contained in KafkaStreamsTest and consequently\r\nit is not part of this

awesome `TaskAssignorConvergenceTest` revealed some issues with the current assignor, which he nailed down as being due to the state constrained and balanced assignments not converging.\r\n\r\nOne way to get an assignment that is as close to the balanced assignment as possible while still being state constrained is of course to start with the balanced assignment, and move tasks around as necessary to satisfy the state constraint. With this basic approach, the converge test is passing.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes some semi-orthogonal refactoring, most significantly the removal of the  assignment maps; we now just immediately assign tasks to the `ClientState` rather than first sticking them in an intermediate map. \r\n\r\nAlso moves `ValidClientsByTaskLoadQueue` to its own file.\r\n\r\nApologies for the length of this PR due to the above, but it didn't seem reasonable to do things the wrong way in the parts I changed, just so they could be undone in a followup PR along with the other

Finish operations for leaderEpoch-updated partitions up to point ZK Exception occurs.\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9769\r\n\r\nFor example, in such case, we will have the following mechanism :\r\n1 - P1 and P2 succeeds. leaderEpoch for them are incremented because no ZkException occurs\r\n2 - while making follower for P3, ZkException occurs and the leaderEpoch is not updated and thus thepartitionsToMakeFollower += partition isn’t executed. We catch this ZkException in line 1498 and log it as an error. No Exception is thrown.\r\n3 - After catching the exception, makeFollower for P4 is then not executed.\r\n4 - so the partitionsToMakeFollower only contains P1, P2. And fetchers are added to these partitionsToMakeFollower\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Choi <li_andchoi@microsoft.com>\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

patch adds a new test case for validating concurrent read/write behavior in the `Log` implementation. In the process of verifying this, we found a race condition in `read`. The previous logic checks whether the start offset is equal to the end offset before collecting the high watermark. It is possible that the log is truncated in between these two conditions which could cause the high watermark to be equal to the log end offset. When this happens, `LogSegment.read` fails because it is unable to find the starting position to read from.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

KAFKA-9826, a log whose first dirty offset was past the start of the active segment and past the last cleaned point resulted in an endless cycle of picking the segment to clean and discarding it. Though this didn't interfere with cleaning other log segments, it kept the log cleaner thread continuously busy (potentially wasting CPU and impacting other running threads) and filled the logs with lots of extraneous messages.\r\n\r\nThis was determined to be because the active segment was getting mistakenly picked for cleaning, and because the `logSegments` code handles (start == end) cases only for (start, end) on a segment boundary: the intent is to return a null list, but if they're not on a segment boundary, the routine returns that segment.\r\n\r\nThis fix has two parts:\r\n1. It changes logSegments to handle start==end by returning an empty List always.\r\n2. It changes the definition of calculateCleanableBytes to not consider anything past the UncleanableOffset; previously, it would potentially shift the UncleanableOffset to match the firstDirtyOffset even if the firstDirtyOffset was past the firstUncleanableOffset. This has no real effect now in the context of the fix for (1) but it makes the code read more like the model that the code is attempting to follow.\r\n\r\nThese changes require modifications to a few test cases that handled this particular test case; they were introduced in the context of KAFKA-8764. Those situations are now handled elsewhere in code, but the tests themselves allowed a DirtyOffset in the active segment, and expected an active segment to be selected for cleaning.\r\n\r\nAn additional unit test for the logSegments call is added. \r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix.

a mid sized broker follow. I have seen worse, but these add up to around 3.8% on a broker that saw GC overhead in CPU time of around 30%. You could argue that this is relatively small, but it seems worthwhile for a low risk change.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/252189/79058104-33e91d80-7c1e-11ea-99c9-0cf2e3571e1f.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/252189/79058105-38add180-7c1e-11ea-8bfd-6e6eafb0c794.png)","created_at":"2020-04-12T01:03:03Z","updated_at":"2020-04-25T20:55:00Z","closed_at":"2020-04-25T20:55:00Z","merged_at":"2020-04-25T20:55:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"cfc34cace523e6d9698a892b9ec7ba4af33d00ea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8467/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8467/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8467/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/409f4830d20d9c71abc402591395c6eac4231653","head":{"label":"lbradstreet:logs-by-dir-allocations","ref":"logs-by-dir-allocations","sha":"409f4830d20d9c71abc402591395c6eac4231653","user":{"login":"lbradstreet","id":252189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet","html_url":"https://github.com/lbradstreet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":154184520,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTQxODQ1MjA=","name":"kafka","full_name":"lbradstreet/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lbradstreet","id":252189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet","html_url":"https://github.com/lbradstreet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lbradstreet/kafka","description":"Mirror

initially-attempted fix (present as the first commit in this PR) caused the transformed worker configuration to be passed to the `Plugins` instance which performs plugin path scanning, instead of the raw (pre-transform) worker configuration. This had the added benefit that worker configuration validation would take place _before_ plugin path scanning, which in some environments can take a while.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as a side effect, the loading of properties of type `CLASS` from the `WorkerConfig` was broken. No clear fix is apparent due to this circular dependency issue: `Plugins` needs to be instantiated and `compareAndSwapWithDelegatingLoader` invoked before creating the worker config since it loads classes when instantiated, and the config provider logic specified in the worker config needs to be performed on the `plugin.path` property before instantiating the `Plugins` instance. This is especially complicated by the fact that config providers are loaded as plugins.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the new proposal is to simply warn the user whenever it appears they are using a config provider in the value for the `plugin.path` property and link to [KAFKA-9845](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9845).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

Incremental Cooperative Rebalancing, if a worker returns after it's been out of the group for sometime (essentially as a zombie worker) and hasn't voluntarily revoked its own connectors and tasks in the meantime, there's the possibility that these assignments have been distributed to other workers and redundant connectors and tasks might be running now in the Connect cluster. \r\n\r\nThis PR complements previous fixes such as KAFKA-9184, KAFKA-9849 and KAFKA-9851 providing a last line of defense against zombie tasks: if at any rebalance round the leader worker detects that there are duplicate assignments in the group, it revokes them completely and resolves duplication with a correct assignment in the rebalancing round that will follow task revocation.

read from the end of the log interleaved with a concurrent write can result in reading data above the expected limit. In particular, this would allow a read above the high watermark. The root of the problem is consecutive calls to `sizeInBytes` in `FileRecords.slice` which do not account for an increase in size. This patch fixes the problem by using a single call to `sizeInBytes` and caching the result.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

patch reworks the SocketServer to always start the acceptor threads after the processor threads and to always stop the acceptor threads before the processor threads. It ensures that the acceptor shutdown is not blocked waiting on the processors to be fully shutdown by decoupling the shutdown signal and the awaiting. It also ensure that the processor threads drain its newConnection queue to unblock acceptors that may be waiting. However, the acceptors still bind during the startup, only the processing of new connections and requests is further delayed.\r\n\r\nThe flow looks like this now:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval socketServer = ...\r\n\r\nsocketServer.startup(startProcessingRequests = false)\r\n// Acceptors are bound.\r\n\r\nsocketServer.startProcessingRequests(authorizerFutures)\r\n// Acceptors and Processors process new connections and requests\r\n\r\nsocketServer.stopProcessingRequests()\r\n// Acceptors and Processors are stopped\r\n\r\nsocketServer.shutdown()\r\n// SocketServer is shutdown (metrics, etc.)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

if a connector is deleted, its task configurations will remain in the config snapshot tracked by the `KafkaConfigBackingStore`. This causes issues with incremental cooperative rebalancing, which utilizes that config snapshot to determine which connectors and tasks need to be assigned across the cluster. Specifically, it first checks to see which connectors are present in the config snapshot, and then, for each of those connectors, queries the snapshot for that connector's task configs.\r\n\r\nThe lifecycle of a connector is for its configuration to be written to the config topic, that write to be picked up by the workers in the cluster and trigger a rebalance, the connector to be assigned to and started by a worker, task configs to be generated by the connector and then written to the config topic, that write to be picked up by the workers in the cluster and trigger a second rebalance, and finally, the tasks to be assigned to and started by workers across the cluster.\r\n\r\nThere is a brief period in between the first time the connector is started and when the second rebalance has completed during which those stale task configs from a previously-deleted version of the connector will be used by the framework to start tasks for that connector.\r\n\r\nThis fix aims to eliminate that window by preemptively clearing the task configs from the config snapshot for a connector whenever it has been deleted.\r\n\r\nAn existing unit test is modified to verify this behavior, and should provide sufficient guarantees that the bug has been fixed, since the cause of the behavior has been narrowed down to incorrect values in the `taskConfigs` field for the `ClusterConfigState`
