pass a matrix object to the print statement\n- More complex things like print(X[1:10, 1:10]) do not work.

(x=scalar, X=matrix).\n\nI realize the matrix printing may not be the best format.

are all in descriptions. Didn't touch code.\n- Corrected inconsistency of description and examples in argument. \n  - In the explanation of argument 'sv', example 1 and 2 contradicted the statement: \"sum(sv) must be 1\".  \n  - Example 2 (sv = (0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25)) seems like a typo(?), because when `i == 5` in `parfor`, `T2` (line55) would be a zero column, so `P` (line57) would be empty.  \n- Corrected location of 'sample.dml' in the example: From `algorithms/utils/sample.dml` to `./scripts/utils/sample.dml`.\n- Added slightly more wordy explanations, as new users may try to learn dml from sample scripts like this one.\n","created_at":"2016-04-12T04:52:42Z","updated_at":"2016-04-14T18:09:22Z","closed_at":"2016-04-14T18:09:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8bdf9a8ae8a2601accce0b6e03aafbf7670be257","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/111/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/111/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/111/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/74428879b224c8fceb1dbb2c2b115afc3faba55a","head":{"label":"ethanyxu:sample-doc","ref":"sample-doc","sha":"74428879b224c8fceb1dbb2c2b115afc3faba55a","user":{"login":"ethanyxu","id":5972986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzI5ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5972986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanyxu","html_url":"https://github.com/ethanyxu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanyxu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanyxu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanyxu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanyxu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanyxu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanyxu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanyxu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanyxu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanyxu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d6da5090188f220b089ddeab048cac4e61c0d6a6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45896813,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTg5NjgxMw==","name":"systemds","full_name":"apache/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds","description":"An

patch with dml/pydml tests is intended to incrementally improve namespace handling to facilitate defining and reusing functions across multiple scripts.  It includes isolated changes to target a specific scenario where dependent functions (e.g., function1 internally calls function2 defined in same script) but are also imported by another script.  The change to StatementBlock was not required but included to help compare blocks when inspecting variables under IDE debugger.\nPrior to this patch, the internal call would fail as described in [SYSTEMML-590] which is covered under 'testFunctionSourceNS'.  The other 2 tests were included to show this patch does not change expected behavior where imported custom function was not fully qualified (testFunctionWithoutNS) and internal custom function call without namespace ok when run directly (testFunctionDefaultNS).\nA few built-in functions were also ran to verify built-ins still found in

@deroneriksson \n\nI believe this fixes the issue with PR #61 with regards to both keeping the history of the `CustomErrorListener` and allowing all 3 commits to compile.  All of the main work has been squashed into the first commit, and the next two commits only involve the refactoring from `CustomErrorListener` as an inner class of `SyntacticErrorListener` to a full outer class.  Note, that we will still need to commit all 3 commits to the repo to maintain the history.\n\nPlease have a look and see if everything checks out.\n","created_at":"2016-02-18T19:36:45Z","updated_at":"2016-02-19T22:56:27Z","closed_at":"2016-02-19T22:56:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"df330782764e7742202c6a6b72643673f9fc1ea6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/73/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/73/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/73/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/25b9188da5524bd0a2bb1dfea0f17bb1e23f1724","head":{"label":"dusenberrymw:pr-61-fix","ref":"pr-61-fix","sha":"25b9188da5524bd0a2bb1dfea0f17bb1e23f1724","user":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":46521692,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NjUyMTY5Mg==","name":"systemml","full_name":"dusenberrymw/systemml","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw/systemml","description":"Mirror

Notebook covers -\n\n```\nIngestion of multiple Datasets from HDFS.\nExploration of the Data using Spark SQL\nMerging of the data from various data sources for preparing data for building Model\nBuilding Model using GLM.dml of SystemML\nUsing GLM-predict.dml for prediction using larger population\nRelating the prediction back to original dataset\nVisualization of Prediction using R libraries using SparkR.\n```\n\nPlease note that this notebook uses a R interpreter for Zeppelin (https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/208/commits) which is not part of main branch. So the SparkR paragraphs will not work if someone is using Zeppelin main branch. Alternatively one can use the branch related to this PR (PR#208). Also one has to have R and other relevant R packages installed separately on the same machine where Zeppelin process is running. the other R packages needed for the plots are googleVis, ggplot2, maptools, htmltools, knitr, repr (from http://irkernel.github.io/).\n","created_at":"2016-02-12T16:19:17Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T07:09:56Z","closed_at":"2016-02-15T18:45:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"21548626702ddc27ba359bfd4fbebf0853555783","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/69/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/69/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/69/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/9f01a1a3ff5a1b807a67c5cdb3f0ca25fd531596","head":{"label":"sourav-mazumder:patch-3","ref":"patch-3","sha":"9f01a1a3ff5a1b807a67c5cdb3f0ca25fd531596","user":{"login":"sourav-mazumder","id":14955207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTU1MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14955207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder","html_url":"https://github.com/sourav-mazumder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51598996,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTU5ODk5Ng==","name":"incubator-systemml","full_name":"sourav-mazumder/incubator-systemml","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sourav-mazumder","id":14955207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTU1MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14955207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder","html_url":"https://github.com/sourav-mazumder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourav-mazumder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sourav-mazumder/incubator-systemml","description":"Mirror

Notebook covers -\n1. Ingestion of multiple Datasets from HDFS.\n2. Exploration of the Data using Spark SQL\n3. Merging of the data from various data sources for preparing data for building Model\n4. Building Model using GLM.dml of SystemML\n5. Using GLM-predict.dml for prediction using larger population\n6. Relating the prediction back to original dataset\n7. Visualization of Prediction using R libraries using SparkR.\n\nPlease note that this notebook uses a R interpreter for Zeppelin (https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/208/commits) which is not part of main branch. So the SparkR paragraphs will not work if someone is using Zeppelin main branch. Alternatively one can use the branch related to this PR (PR#208). Also one has to have R and other relevant R packages installed separately on the same machine where Zeppelin process is running. the other R packages needed for the plots are googleVis, ggplot2, maptools, htmltools, knitr, repr (from http://irkernel.github.io/).\n","created_at":"2016-02-12T15:46:06Z","updated_at":"2016-02-12T16:20:41Z","closed_at":"2016-02-12T16:20:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/68/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/68/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/68/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/b93cfe5b42494daa8e8df39fa172cf6718d3b9e4","head":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"b93cfe5b42494daa8e8df39fa172cf6718d3b9e4","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45896813,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTg5NjgxMw==","name":"systemds","full_name":"apache/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds","description":"An

SystemML always looks for a configuration file in a default location (in the current directory), and will always emit a warning if it is not found.  Additionally, SystemML allows a user to supply a configuration file location.  In this latter case, SystemML will still attempt to read the default configuration file, emitting a warning if it is not present (which causes confusion), as well as the user-supplied file.  If both are loaded, the user-supplied file will be merged into the default configuration with an overwrite strategy.\n\nAlways looking for a default file, even when a file is explicitly supplied, causes confusion, and may create unintended side effects.  If a user explicitly supplies a configuration file, we should simply use that file, rather than attempting to also read an additional default file at the same time.  In order to provide backwards compatibility, if the user does not supply a file, then we should fall back to the default file location.  If that file is also not found, we should then fall back to the internal defaults.  Note that this means that the configuration settings of a user-supplied file will _not_ be merged with those of a default file, assuming both are found.\n\nAdditionally, in order to supply an additional configuration file, the `-config=path/to/file` flag has to be used, and it only works with the equals sign `=` present, which is unlike all other flags that use spaces.  Instead, we should support `-config path/to/file`.\n","created_at":"2016-01-30T01:41:53Z","updated_at":"2016-04-14T18:21:21Z","closed_at":"2016-04-14T18:21:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"541080dcd2ca1c04e035f520a7a828d2bd39411b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/58/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/58/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/58/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/100fe497a401174885e5e9c9ce27f076f558b785","head":{"label":"dusenberrymw:SYSTEMML-495_Simplify_Configuration_Loading","ref":"SYSTEMML-495_Simplify_Configuration_Loading","sha":"100fe497a401174885e5e9c9ce27f076f558b785","user":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":46521692,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NjUyMTY5Mg==","name":"systemml","full_name":"dusenberrymw/systemml","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw/systemml","description":"Mirror

adds a `.gitattributes` file with a setting that will correctly normalize all files (other than those that are Windows-specific, such as .bat, .exe, etc.) upon checkin to the repo to have the correct Unix-style new line characters, rather than Windows-style carriage returns, while allowing for correct OS-specific new line characters while working locally.  Additionally, this setting will cause Git to correctly maintain the normalization for future commits.  As [seen during review](https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@systemml.incubator.apache.org/msg00254.html) of the first 0.9 release candidate, the lack of this normalization can cause major issues, and the issue is [confirmed in the official Git

the format of the metadata file JSON object to have the commas placed at the end of the lines, rather than at the beginning of the lines.\n\nPreviously, the metadata files written would be formatted with the commas placed at the beginning of the lines, which was somewhat strange looking:\n\n``` json\n{ \n    \"data_type\": \"matrix\"\n    ,\"value_type\": \"double\"\n    ,\"rows\": 1\n    ,\"cols\": 2\n    ,\"nnz\": 2\n    ,\"format\": \"text\"\n    ,\"description\": { \"author\": \"SystemML\" } \n}\n```\n\nThis change places the commas at the end of the lines, as follows:\n\n``` json\n{ \n    \"data_type\": \"matrix\",\n    \"value_type\": \"double\",\n    \"rows\": 1,\n    \"cols\": 2,\n    \"nnz\": 2,\n    \"format\": \"text\",\n    \"description\": { \"author\": \"SystemML\" } \n}\n```\n\nThis applies to matrix and scalar metadata.  Since this is still valid (and perhaps better formatted) JSON, there shouldn't be any issues, and local testing supports this for writes and reads.\n","created_at":"2016-01-19T23:52:39Z","updated_at":"2016-01-21T01:22:48Z","closed_at":"2016-01-21T01:22:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5732f54c957d71e0f0df7ee492ab9d4f85381053","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/48/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/48/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/48/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/935e9f04880bac4c9b5e49ba90c456f4ec24db59","head":{"label":"dusenberrymw:Update_Metadata_File_Formatting","ref":"Update_Metadata_File_Formatting","sha":"935e9f04880bac4c9b5e49ba90c456f4ec24db59","user":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":46521692,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NjUyMTY5Mg==","name":"systemml","full_name":"dusenberrymw/systemml","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dusenberrymw","id":5431337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzEzMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5431337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw","html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dusenberrymw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dusenberrymw/systemml","description":"Mirror

in progress**\n\n---\n\nCurrently, any DML functions that require scalars will not accept 1x1 matrices.  Matrix indexing always returns a matrix, so a statement such as `A[1,1]` from the following simple example will return a single-valued matrix, even though it logically represents a scalar.  Thus, in order to use this value as a scalar, the `as.scalar(...)` function is required.\n\n``` r\nA = matrix(7, rows=10, cols=10)                                                                                                                \nprint( \"A[1,1]: \" + as.scalar(A[1,1]))  // 7\n```\n\nIn this scenario, the required usage of `as.scalar(...)` can cause confusion, and can be viewed as a violation of SystemML's goal of hiding the underlying data representation from the user.\n\nAdditionally, many of the built-in functions, such as `rowVars(...)`, accept matrices without other requirements of dimensionality, and thus will accept a 1x1 matrix, yet will not accept a scalar value.  We should allow any such functions that accept 1x1 matrices to also accept scalar values.\n\n``` r\na = 4\nprint(\"Row variances of scalar are: \" + as.scalar(rowVars(as.matrix(a))))  // 0\n```\n\nIn order to achieve this, we can add implicit casting between scalar values and 1x1 matrices within the parser during the validation stage as needed.\n\nWith this PR, the following can be done:\n\n``` r\nA = matrix(7, rows=10, cols=10)\nprint( \"A[1,1]: \" + A[1,1])  // 7\n```\n\n``` r\na = 4\nprint(\"Row variances of scalar are: \" + rowVars(a))  // 0\n```\n\n---\n\n**Note:  This is still a work in progress**, as there are likely additional fixes/improvements/changes that can be made, such as determining side-effects on other operations, or HOP rewrites such as removing unnecessary

introduces new \"**_variance**_\" and \"**_standard deviation**_\" unary operators to the DML language, including row and column variants for each: `var(X)`, `rowVars(X)`, `colVars(X)`, `sd(X)`, `rowSds(X)`, `colSds(X)`.  The implementation includes parser, HOP, LOP, runtime, and optimizer components.\n\nThe following provides an slightly more-detailed overview, and a full discussion can be found in the design document <sup>**[1]**</sup>:\n- Adds `sd`, `colSds`, and `rowSds` built-in functions for standard deviation to the DML language.\n- Adds `var`, `colVars`, and `rowVars` built-in functions for variance to the DML language.\n- Creates a new `VAR` operation type for the existing `AggUnaryOp` HOP.\n- Compiles the `sd`, `colSds`, and `rowSds` built-in DML functions to the square root of the variance via the `VAR` HOP type wrapped in a `OpOp1.SQRT` HOP type.\n- Creates a new `Var` operation type for the existing `Aggregate` and `PartialAggregate` LOPs.\n- Compiles the `VAR` HOP type to the `Var` LOP type.\n- Creates new runtime opcodes: `\"avar\"`, `\"uavar\"`, `\"uarvar\"`, `\"uacvar\"`.\n- Compiles the `Var` LOP type to new opcodes.\n- Parses the new opcodes into runtime aggregate operators that use the `CM` runtime function with `Variance` type.\n- Creates a new `VAR` aggregate type in the core unary aggregate library.\n- Matches the runtime aggregate operators using the `CM` function of `Variance` type to the `VAR` case.\n- Extends the core unary aggregate library with new variance functions for the `VAR` case.\n- Adds logic for incremental aggregation of variances computed for multiple partitions. <sup>**[2]**</sup>\n- Extends existing optimizer rewrites for column-wise and row-wise aggregation to cover row and column variances.\n- Adds new optimizer rewrites to optimize row and column variance operations under certain conditions.\n\n**[1]**: ~~_To be posted later once the JIRA project is set up._~~  This has been posted to [SYSTEMML-217](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SYSTEMML-217).\n**[2]**: The current implementations of `incrementalAggregate(...)` in `MatrixBlock` still need to be refactored, however, I've elected to postpone that to a future JIRA in order to limit the scope of this one.\n\ncc @mboehm7
