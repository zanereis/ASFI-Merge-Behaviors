What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- Adding support for \"bulk_insert_dataset\" which has better performance compared to existing \"bulk_insert\". \r\n- This implementation uses Datasource for writing to storage. \r\n- Support for key generators to operate on Row(rather than HoodieRecords as per existing \"bulk_insert\") is added.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added support for \"bulk_insert_dataset\" which uses Datasource for writing.\r\n- This path introduces a new datasource called \"org.apache.hudi.internal\" and all supporting cast like DefaultSource, DataSourceWriter(HoodieDataSourceInternalWriter), DataWriterFactory(HoodieBulkInsertDataInternalWriterFactory), DataWriter(HoodieBulkInsertDataInternalWriter), etc for the same.\r\n- This patch also introduces HoodieRowCreateHandle, HoodieInternalRowFileWriter, HoodieInternalRowParquetWriter, etc to assist in writing InternalRows to parquet(and respective factory classes). \r\n- Have added HoodieInternalRow which wraps InternalRow and exposes meta columns. \r\n- Have added HoodieInternalWriteStatus to hold write status (instead of WriteStatus used in HoodieRecord write paths), since this hold Rows instead of HoodieRecords.\r\n- This patch adds changes to KeyGenerator to ensure getRecordKey and getPartitionPath is supported with Row for \"bulk_insert_dataset\". New apis are added to KeyGenerator, but default implementation is added so as to not have any breaking change. All keygenerator implementations have been fixed on this regards. \r\n- Added HoodieDatasetBulkInsertHelper to assist in prepping the dataset before calling into datasource write. For commit, HoodieWriteClient is leveraged. \r\n- Some additional functionalities on top of bulk inserts are not covered in this patch. Have create [HUDI-1014](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1104), [HUDI-1105](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1105) and [HUDI-1106](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1106). Namely, UserDefinedCustomPartitioner, Dedup and drop duplicates. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added tests in

pull request\r\n\r\nJIRA https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1087  \r\nISSUE https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/1790\r\n\r\nThis [pr](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/1677/files) calls ```HiveDecimalWritable.enforcePrecisionScale``` to handle decimal type for Hive realtime querying. But ```HiveDecimalWritable.enforcePrecisionScale``` is only available for Hive 2.x, so when using SparkSQL (which uses ```1.2.1.spark2``` version), it will throw a ```methodNotFound``` error.    \r\n\r\nThis PR replaces ```HiveDecimalWritable.enforcePrecisionScale``` with ```HiveDecimalUtils.enforcePrecisionScale``` which is compatible with both Hive 2.x and Hive 1.2.1.spark2.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Replaced ```HiveDecimalWritable.enforcePrecisionScale``` with ```HiveDecimalUtils.enforcePrecisionScale``` which is compatible with both Hive 2.x and Hive 1.2.1.spark2.\r\n\r\n##

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nThis commit addresses two issues:\r\n      1. Honors end time if less than the most recent completed commit time\r\n      2. Doesnt require a base parquet file to be present in case when the begin and end times match only the the deltacommits.\r\n\r\n    To achieve this:\r\n    - Created a seperate FileSplit for handling incremental queries\r\n    - New RecordReader to handle the new FileSplit\r\n    - FileSlice Scanner to scan files in a File Slice. First takes base parquet file (if present) and applies merged records from all log files in that slice. If base file is not present returns merged records from log files on scanning\r\n    - HoodieParquetRealtimeInputFormat modified to switch to this HoodieMORIncrementalFileSplit and HoodieMORIncrementalRecordReader from getSplit(..) and getRecordReader(..) in case of incremental queries.\r\n    - Includes unit test to test different incremental queries\r\n*(For example: This pull request adds quick-start document.)*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Pending action items before moving to full PR\r\n- Noted a bunch of TODOs. will try to resolve them.\r\n- Still working on testing this fix in an integrated environment. in the process, I plan to test in Docker Demo setup  that provides testing across all query engines.\r\n- Needs changes to HoodieCombinedInputFormat\r\n- May need changes in Spark as well. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n(or)\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end.*\r\n  - *Added HoodieClientWriteTest to verify the change.*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a job locally.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title &

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n1) InputFormat backward compatibility is broken in several places because equality check is done including package name in multiple places https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/hudi-hadoop-mr/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/hadoop/hive/HoodieCombineHiveInputFormat.java#L154. Fix this by using inheritance and using appropriate package name.\r\n\r\n2) For 0.4.x versions, reading worked with ORCInputFormat as well. For 0.4.x, we used shim to read as opposed to throwing error for non-hoodie formats. Bring back same functionality to master.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fix InputFormat class lookup based on package name of source inputformat.\r\n- Do not throw error for non-hoodie input format and delegate reading to shim loader\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\nVerified end-to-end in uber internal hive service deployment.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nImplementation of the HFile base and log file format. This is useful for RFC-15 and RFC-08 among others.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. Includes HFileWriter and HFileReader\r\n2. Includes HFileInputFormat for both snapshot and realtime input format for Hive\r\n3. Unit test for new code\r\n4. IT for using HFile format and querying using Hive (Presto and SparkSQL are not supported)\r\n\r\nAdvantage:\r\nHFile file format saves data as binary key-value pairs. This implementation chooses the following values:\r\n1. Key = Hoodie Record Key (as bytes)\r\n2. Value = Avro encoded GenericRecord (as bytes)\r\n\r\nHFile allows efficient lookup of a record by key or range of keys. Hence, this base file format is well suited to applications like RFC-15, RFC-08 which will benefit from the ability to lookup records by key or search in a range of keys without having to read the entire data/log format.\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\nHFile storage format has certain limitations when used as a general purpose data storage format.\r\n1. Does not have a implemented reader for Presto and SparkSQL\r\n2. Is not a columnar file format and hence may lead to lower compression levels and greater IO on query side due to lack of column pruning\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n  - Added e2e integration tests for HFile format\r\n  - Added unit test for HFileWriter and HFileReader.\r\n  - Added unit test for HFileInputFormat.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- When updating partition path to an existing record in global bloom, the location is set to empty. So, this in turn results in latest file id to be picked up. But we want the same fileId where actual record is found to be tagged. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fix Global bloom to ensure HoodieRecordLocation is set in record that needs to be deleted when partition path is getting updated. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nFixing deletes for inserts in same write batch.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nIf same record is both inserted and deleted in same batch(possible when listening to events via deltastreamer), precombine will favor delete record. But then, in our OverwriteWithLatestAvroPayload, only combineAndGetUpdateValue checks for delete flag, where as getInsertValue does not. Hence the issue is that, for these cases, deleted records are still seen in read query. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  -

What is the purpose of this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes [HUDI-539](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-539).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Make `HoodieROTablePathFilter` implement `Configurable`\r\n\r\nTo follow through the code and see why the table filter needs to implement Configurable please go through the following links:\r\n1. [This](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v2.4.4/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/InMemoryFileIndex.scala#L125) is how Spark creates the filter\r\n2. Filter is instantiated via [reflection](https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/FileInputFormat.java#L159)\r\n3. Which calls a [setConf](https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/util/ReflectionUtils.java#L133) method coming from the [Configurable](https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/util/ReflectionUtils.java#L72-L74) type\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing unit tests, such as TestHoodieROTablePathFilter.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull-request relocates jetty during the packaging of `hudi-spark-bundle`.\r\n\r\nI'm testing Hudi in Databricks and found there is a transitive dependency conflict around Jetty.  (Databricks runtime 6.6)[https://docs.databricks.com/release-notes/runtime/6.6.html] provides Jetty 9.3; Hudi has a dependency on Jetty 9.4 (specifically, `SessionHandler.setHttpOnly()` doesn't exist in 9.3).  (Databricks runtime 7.0)[https://docs.databricks.com/release-notes/runtime/7.0.html) includes Jetty 9.4, but it also includes Spark 3.0.0; Hudi requires 2.x.\r\n\r\nRelocating Jetty during packaging solves the problem and allows Hudi to operate with its own version, independent of what Databricks provides.  This allows `hudi-spark-bundle` to work within Databricks out-of-the-box with no further alterations.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Modify `packaging/hudi-spark-bundle/pom.xml` to relocate Jetty during packaging\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.  There are no modifications to code functionality.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit (used `[MINOR]` tag due to simple nature of the change)\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

pull request\r\n\r\nRelates to #1720 \r\nThis pull request adds test case to verify table can be created normally without partition keys, when sync non-parititioned table to hive.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- *Add test code in HoodieSparkSqlWriterSuite.*\r\n- *Two pom.xml involved. One is hudi-spark/pom.xml, adding the tests dependency of hudi-hive-sync module, because of HiveTestService. The other is for the parent pom.xml, I free the JTA dependency. The test seem to rely on the jta package, which can lead to a test failure. I  wonder if these changes have any impact.*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Committer

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nThis pull request fix deltastreamer use kafkasource (such as JsonKafkaSource / AvroKafkaSource)  with offset reset strategy:latest can't consume data because the checkpoint string store in .commit file .commit file will always be an empty string.\r\n\r\nFor example, i want to inject data from kafka into a new hudi table. \r\nFrom `org.apache.hudi.utilities.deltastreamer.DeltaSync#readFromSource`, the first time consume `resumeCheckpointStr` will be `Option.empty()`, and the `lastCkptStr` used in `org.apache.hudi.utilities.sources.Source#fetchNewData` will also be `Option.empty()`.\r\n\r\nFetch new data code like this:\r\n```java\r\nprotected InputBatch<JavaRDD<GenericRecord>> fetchNewData(Option<String> lastCheckpointStr, long sourceLimit) {\r\n    OffsetRange[] offsetRanges = offsetGen.getNextOffsetRanges(lastCheckpointStr, sourceLimit);\r\n    long totalNewMsgs = CheckpointUtils.totalNewMessages(offsetRanges);\r\n    if (totalNewMsgs <= 0) {\r\n      return new InputBatch<>(Option.empty(), lastCheckpointStr.isPresent() ? lastCheckpointStr.get() : \"\");\r\n    } else {\r\n      LOG.info(\"About to read \" + totalNewMsgs + \" from Kafka for topic :\" + offsetGen.getTopicName());\r\n    }\r\n    JavaRDD<GenericRecord> newDataRDD = toRDD(offsetRanges);\r\n    return new InputBatch<>(Option.of(newDataRDD), KafkaOffsetGen.CheckpointUtils.offsetsToStr(offsetRanges));\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen get next offset ranges in `org.apache.hudi.utilities.sources.helpers.KafkaOffsetGen#getNextOffsetRanges` code like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Determine the offset ranges to read from\r\nif (lastCheckpointStr.isPresent() && !lastCheckpointStr.get().isEmpty()) {\r\n    fromOffsets = checkupValidOffsets(consumer, lastCheckpointStr, topicPartitions);\r\n} else {\r\n    KafkaResetOffsetStrategies autoResetValue = KafkaResetOffsetStrategies\r\n                .valueOf(props.getString(\"auto.offset.reset\", Config.DEFAULT_AUTO_RESET_OFFSET.toString()).toUpperCase());\r\n    switch (autoResetValue) {\r\n        case EARLIEST:\r\n            fromOffsets = consumer.beginningOffsets(topicPartitions);\r\n            break;\r\n        case LATEST:\r\n            fromOffsets = consumer.endOffsets(topicPartitions);\r\n            break;\r\n        default:\r\n             throw new HoodieNotSupportedException(\"Auto reset value must be one of 'earliest' or 'latest' \");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n// Obtain the latest offsets.\r\ntoOffsets = consumer.endOffsets(topicPartitions);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause `lastCkptStr` is `Option.empty()`, fromOffsets and toOffsets all will be consumer's endOffsets, `totalNewMsgs` size is 0 and first time consume checkpoint string return value is an empty string. \r\n\r\nNext consume operation will get this empty string checkpoint, in `KafkaOffsetGen` offset range will always be handled to reset as latest and return another empty string checkpoint.\r\n\r\nBy watching, checkpoint will be normal only if kafka latest offset change between `fromOffsets` and `toOffsets` get end offset value.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Modify checkpoint string return value of JsonKafkaSource & AvroKafkaSource method fetchNewData(), when offsetRanges total message count <= 0.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as : \r\nRun TestKafkaSource\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ]

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nFor Delete API, I noticed \"hoodie.delete.shuffle.parallelism\" isn't used as opposed to \"hoodie.upsert.shuffle.parallelism\" is used for [upsert](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/hudi-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/table/action/commit/WriteHelper.java#L104), this creates the performance difference between delete by upsert API with \"EmptyHoodieRecordPayload\" and delete API for certain cases.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-993 has more detail.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Let [deduplicateKeys](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/hudi-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/table/action/commit/DeleteHelper.java#L51-L57) method use \"hoodie.delete.shuffle.parallelism\"\r\n* Repartition inputRDD as \"hoodie.delete.shuffle.parallelism\" in case \"hoodie.combine.before.delete=false\"\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [X] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [X] Commit message is descriptive of the

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR creates a cleaner interface for HUDI to integrate different type of base file formats (ORC, HFILE, etc).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThe type of the base file format is chosen during the initial creation of HUDI dataset. The name of the base file format is written to the hoodie.properties file and is available to reset of the modules via HoodieTableConfig.\r\n\r\n*Writer side*: HoodieStorageWriter  \r\n*Reader side*: HoodieStorageReader \r\n*InputFormat side*: HoodieInputFormat and HoodieRealtimeInputFormat\r\n\r\nTo test the interface, I have also implemented support for HFile base file format. \r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n1. HUDI-960 and HUDI-961 are being implemented to abstract the DataBlock in the Log files. Currently the MOR table log blocks are still being saved as Avro formatted.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nAll existing tests should work and pass.\r\n\r\nHoodie Table tests have been parameterized to run with various base file formats.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella
