language \"when two tasks defer based on the same trigger\" is a bit confusing. Many tasks can reuse the same trigger class.  But two tasks can't defer using the same trigger _instance_. I think what's important to call out here, and what I try to make clearer, is that the exact same instance of the trigger may have multiple copies of itself running.\r\n\r\nAdditionally I clarify cleanup is not _only_ called \"when this happens\" (that is, when trigger is \"suddenly removed\"), but called every time the trigger instance exits, no matter the reason.\r\n\r\ncc @andrewgodwin

#10288\r\n\r\nI've tried to remove warnings during `GCSToBigQueryOperator` as described in issue #10288.\r\nAs a result, I copied almost all code from `bq_hook.create_external_table` and `bq_hook.run_load` which made the operator's `execute` method very sophisticated.\r\n\r\nThat's why I just switched from `cursor` method calls to `BigQueryHook` methods. In my opinion, these methods should not be deprecated.\r\n\r\nWe need someplace for complex dict creation, like `configuration` for `bq_hook.insert_job()` or `table_recource` for `bq_hook.create_empty_table()`. In my opinion, better to keep this code in BigQueryHook and don't move to

There was a review for adding an updated view for displaying the duration column in a more readable way.\r\n\r\nTo be determined if the same application to the TI views are desired as this PR has done so. Otherwise this is just to be a tool to translate some timedelta, or float/int, into the smallest grouped unit of measure to declare how long the duration has been running.\r\n\r\nOne open question is, is it preferred to make it optionable to apply this change to display the duration as this readable way vs the original timedelta way.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10408007/145073449-dc50e6f8-795c-4a72-b1ad-aa77f24c3896.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull

tests did not follow the best test writing practices used in the project:\r\n* Instead of mocking, class inheritance was used to override method implementations\r\n* No environment variables were used

you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

An alternative mechanism is used to provide OUT parameters; instead of needing the `cursor` object (which is not available to us using the DB API hook abstraction), the user must instead pass a Python type reference (e.g., `int`) as the value of the parameter.\r\n2. The return value is the \"unwrapped\" bindvars (basically the OUT parameters as you would expect). This follows from (1) since we do not use `cursor.var` to create a bind variable in the first place.\r\n\r\nIn addition, an optional `procedure` argument has been added to `OracleOperator`. This can be used instead of `sql` to call a stored procedure directly from the operator.\r\n\r\nThis functionality builds on

`return_value`.\r\n\r\nPossible use case:\r\nIf we need to run pipeline only when some files exist in a certain directory. Then callable in `ShortCircuitOperator` could return all files in the directory. If there are no files then downstream tasks will be skipped (`[] == False`) otherwise downstream tasks just will take the list of files and process

#7858\r\n\r\nAdding the ability to configure the `ShortCircuitOperator` to respect trigger rules for downstream tasks.  Currently this operator ignores all trigger rules and forcibly skips all downstream tasks.  However, there are use cases in which downstream tasks from the `ShortCircuitOperator` have trigger rules applied such that said tasks should execute even if upstream tasks are skipped by the operator (e.g. multiple branches that execute in parallel, one branch can be short-circuited at some point, and the branches converge).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new parameter, `ignore_downstream_trigger_rules`, which allows users to have the `ShortCircuitOperator` perform a \"hard short\" (i.e. blindly skip all downstream tasks; the current behavior) or a \"soft short\" (i.e. the immediate, downstream task(s) are skipped only and the Scheduler is left to handle the trigger rules appropriately).\r\n\r\nThe unit tests for the `ShortCircuitOperator` were refactored as part of this change as well.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more

runner setgid command was executed after importing several airflow\r\nimports, which - when executed for the first time could take quite\r\nsome time (possibly even few seconds). The setgid command should be\r\ndone as soon as possible, in case of any errors in the import, it\r\nwould fail and the setgid could be never set.\r\n\r\nAlso this caused the test_start_and_terminate test to fail in CI\r\nbecause the imports could take arbitrary long time (depending on\r\nparallel tests and whether the imported modules were already\r\nloaded in the process so setting the gid could be set after more\r\nthan 0.5 seconds.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes it twofold:\r\n\r\n* setgid is moved to be first instruction to be executed (also\r\n  signal handling was moved to before the potentially long\r\n  imports)\r\n* the test was fixed to wait actively and only fail after the\r\n  timeout of 1s (which should not happen before of the fix above)\r\n\r\nAdditionally the test was using `task test` command rather than task run,\r\nand in some circumstances when you tried to run it locally,\r\nwhen FORK was disabled (MacOS) the same test could fail with\r\na different error because --error-file flag is not defined for\r\n`task test` command but it is automatically added by the runner.\r\n\r\nThe task command has been changed to `run'\r\n\r\nFixing this tests caused occasional test_on_kill failure\r\nwhich suffered from similar problem and had similar sleep\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\nThanks to that the test will be usually faster as no significant delays\r\nwill be introduced.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

BigQueryToMySqlOperator](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/17198)\r\n\r\nThis fixes an issue with the BigQueryToMsSqlOperator that is similar to what was encountered with the BigQueryToMySqlOperator. Specifically, this PR:\r\n\r\n- Consolidates \"_bq_get_data\" from both operators into a single function with the updated logic from the BigQueryToMySqlOperator\r\n- Updates the deprecated \"get_tabledata\" function to call \"list_rows\" using key word arguments instead of positional\r\n- Adds a few missing type hints\r\n\r\nThanks in advance to maintainers.

feedback.\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-02T23:52:10Z","updated_at":"2021-12-30T10:56:45Z","closed_at":"2021-12-30T10:56:45Z","merged_at":"2021-12-30T10:56:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"af4a2b0240fbf79a0a6774a9662243050e8fea9c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"turbaszek","id":9528307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9528307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek","html_url":"https://github.com/turbaszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"vikramkoka","id":25178089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTc4MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25178089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka","html_url":"https://github.com/vikramkoka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/19988\r\n\r\nSplitting this `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` query into two queries (`CREATE TABLE LIKE ..` followed by `INSERT INTO`) because the former doesn't play nicely with MySQL.\r\n\r\nThis PR is inherently difficult to test/validate, but I ran the proposed queries against the metadata database in our development environment (where we first ran into this issue) and was able to replicate the issue and verify the fix:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// replicating the issue:\r\n\r\nMySQL [airflow] > create table _airflow_moved__2_2__task_instance as select source.* from task_instance as source;\r\nERROR 1786 (HY000): Statement violates GTID consistency: CREATE TABLE ... SELECT.\r\n\r\n// Validating that splitting the query fixes the issue\r\n\r\nMySQL [airflow] > create table _airflow_moved__2_2__task_instance like task_instance;\r\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.063 sec)\r\n\r\nMySQL [airflow] > INSERT INTO _airflow_moved__2_2__task_instance select source.* from task_instance as source left join dag_run as dr on (source.dag_id = dr.dag_id and source.execution_date = dr.execution_date) where dr.id is null;\r\nQuery OK, 22900 rows affected (2.110 sec)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTomorrow I can create a patched image with these changes and validate the fix in our development environment.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request
