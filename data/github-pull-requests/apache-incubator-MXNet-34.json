Calling setenv concurrently with getenv leads to random crashes which have been reported in several ocassions but so far haven't been fixed.\r\n\r\nThis patch avoids using getenv and setenv and it should address those random crashes while improving handling of the library intialization in the LibraryInitializer object.\r\n\r\nFixes #13438\r\nFixes #14979\r\n\r\nFixes minor issues with #15755 \r\n\r\nAggregated dynamic library code in LibraryInitializer.\r\nVerified Dtor is called on exit.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Instead of changing OMP_NUM_THREADS it directly set_thread_max to 1, even though OMP is disabled.\r\n-

Description ##\r\nThis PR builds on top of https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15489, which was reverted by https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15755.\r\n\r\nIt includes the following additional changes:\r\n- Changes to Makefile and CMake flows to build sample library as part of MXNet build\r\n- Modifications to CI to stash/un-stash the library binary from build stage to test stage\r\n- Loads the binary as part of unit test\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

[JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-05T07:06:42Z","updated_at":"2019-08-07T05:29:44Z","closed_at":"2019-08-07T05:29:44Z","merged_at":"2019-08-07T05:29:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"ce62873ae24299242a9c809fd7b83060a0374163","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":998884732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTg4ODQ3MzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Quantization","name":"Quantization","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"Issues/Feature

Description ##\r\nSorry that I wrote a bug in the two APIs `MXEnginePushAsyncND` and `MXEnginePushSyncND`, whose argument should be an array pointer of NDArrayHandle.\r\n\r\nIssue: #15774 \r\nmaster branch: #15751 \r\nv1.5.x branch: #15775 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Modify the type of arguments to 'NDArry**'\r\n- [x] Update the unittest\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-05T04:24:23Z","updated_at":"2019-08-08T03:15:49Z","closed_at":"2019-08-08T03:15:49Z","merged_at":"2019-08-08T03:15:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"79d8d8656691c19502b7b71bf8c7d9001cdc3a4a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":206159502,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDYxNTk1MDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":738857750,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3Mzg4NTc3NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/API%20change","name":"API

PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA-978 issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-978) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nCurrent `mx.np.random.uniform` does not support parameters (low and high) as `Ndarray`, as the current version is implemented by wrapping `mxnet.ndarray.random.uniform`, which behaves in a different way **when the output shape is given by the user** compared with native Numpy. \r\nFor example: \r\n```\r\nlow = np.zeros((1,4))\r\nhigh = np.ones((1,4))\r\nshape = (2,4,4)\r\n```\r\n`mxnet.ndarray.random.uniform(low, high, shape)`  would have output tensor of shape 1x4x2x4x4, however, result from `numpy.random.uniform(low, high, shape)` would have shape 2x4x4.\r\n\r\nAnother major difference is that,  numpy allows parameters to have different shapes as long as they are broadcastable.\r\nFor example: \r\n```\r\nlow = np.zeros((1,4))\r\nhigh = np.ones((4,4))\r\nshape = (2,4,4)\r\n```\r\nThis setting would cause `Operator _sample_uniform inferring shapes failed.` with `mxnet.ndarray.random.uniform`.\r\n\r\nThis pull request implements a uniform distribution generator with numpy behavior and GPU support.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] New backend for random.uniform (np_uniform_op.*) implemented.\r\n- [x] Current np.random.uniform() in python frontend is renamed to __deprecated_uniform().\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- When both low and high are python scalars and `size` is not defined, a scalar tensor would be returned. This is different from native Numpy, which would return python scalar if both parameters are python scalar.\r\nFor

been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nChanged the function signature to take operator as a parameter.\r\nNow I can verify if that operator is an op that needs 4D tensor specifically and only then pass 4D data.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nMissed this because when I run benchmark tests they run without failure. \r\nJust that input is 4d instead of default 2d

free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nLarge Index Support APIs

Description ##\r\ntest CI/CD\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nThis PR targets the mkldnn-v1.0 branch and intends to:\r\n- [x] upgrade mkldnn submodule from v0.20.0 to v1.0.1\r\n- [x] update make and cmake build\r\n- [x] set MXNET_USE_MKLDNN=100 to skip the compilation for legacy integration code\r\n- [x] remove mklml and iomp5 stuffs from build/ci/pip\r\n- [x] skip mkldnn specific unit tests\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-30T16:14:55Z","updated_at":"2019-08-11T09:57:13Z","closed_at":"2019-08-11T09:57:13Z","merged_at":"2019-08-11T09:57:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"5e5fe0459850e4e3bfb2c41511dbbd686bb05f28","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

memory leaks caused by multiple calls to Extract functions.\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\nMultiple calls to the Extract function can cause **memory leaks**, so we need to use the singleton pattern to create only one instance of executor.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [x] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-30T12:20:34Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T19:25:38Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f9d57e3d0814301c429477ad8469bb4a705d3649","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":273991937,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzM5OTE5Mzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/C++","name":"C++","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Related

Description ##\r\nDifferentiable [svd](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.svd.html)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- add np.linalg.svd\r\n- add forward and backward tests\r\n\r\n##

Description ##\r\nImplementation of numpy `take` operator in mxnet.\r\nFix a bug that backward computation of `ndarray.take` does not check argument `mode`.\r\n\r\nThe version that cherry-pick on new numpy branch, old pr -> #15567.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\nImplementation of numpy `identity` operator in mxnet.\r\nThe version that cherry-pick on new numpy branch, old pr -> #15511.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- add `tril` op\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nWelcome @reminisce, @haojin2, and others for

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

a run-time error caused by mismatch of output dimensions.\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\n\r\nThe dimensions output with origin code and model is **(2, 1024, 1, 1)**, which may lead to the following errors:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nterminate called after throwing an instance of 'dmlc::Error'\r\n  what():  [10:34:56] /mnt/feature_extract/3rdparty/mxnet-cpp-package/include/mxnet-cpp/ndarray.hpp:379: Check

Description ##\r\nPR intends to add support for higher order gradient for `softsign`, `hard_sigmoid`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA-978 issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-978) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] higher order gradient for a `softsign`, `hard_sigmoid`.\r\n- [x] unit test for the same.\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-28T09:02:54Z","updated_at":"2021-06-16T23:13:44Z","closed_at":"2021-06-16T23:13:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1cd74aadc8fa43b9bc862fcf309acde1e0340345","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":993234718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTMyMzQ3MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Backend","name":"Backend","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

Description ##\r\nHi, there.\r\nI add the contrib operators into cpp-package.\r\nThe prefix of their name is `_`. For example, the name of ROIAlign is `_contrib_ROIAlign`.\r\nThe number of lines of `cpp-package/include/mxnet-cpp/op.h` is around 30 thousand after this PR, 16 thousand before this PR.\r\nI'm not sure whether to divide the contribution operators into a new header file, like `contrib_op.h`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] update `dmlc-core` for adding the type name of `dim_t (int64_t)`.  https://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core/pull/540\r\n- [x] support type name for `mxnet::Tuple<T>`\r\n- [x] support more data types and add more operators in `cpp-package/scripts/OpWrapperGenerator.py`\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-27T05:11:30Z","updated_at":"2019-07-29T18:43:07Z","closed_at":"2019-07-29T18:43:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5eeb49839340192d1f2497eaae8a56af97bbc683","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15673/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15673/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/15673/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/5c6ab0c0864c1792321c5ae89ef0a0b3a8fe9132","head":{"label":"zhreshold:fix-install-error","ref":"fix-install-error","sha":"5c6ab0c0864c1792321c5ae89ef0a0b3a8fe9132","user":{"login":"zhreshold","id":3307514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDc1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3307514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold","html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":69486423,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2OTQ4NjQyMw==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"zhreshold/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhreshold","id":3307514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDc1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3307514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold","html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n\r\n**Break out each docs package generation to separate pipelines.**\r\n  ✅Python - porting the mx-theme to be local to the repo to facilitate modification as part of this project's PRs; this is from the \"beta site\"\r\n  ✅R - using the same theme as Python; also from the \"beta site\"; found to be not reproducible or current, so disabled for now.\r\n  ✅C/CPP - currently co-mingled Doxygen microsite output\r\n  ✅Julia - julia docs output to microsite\r\n  ✅Scala - scaladocs output to microsite\r\n  ✅Java - javadocs output to microsite\r\n  ✅Clojure - lein output to microsite\r\n  ✅Jekyll website for main pages \r\n\r\nLegend:\r\n✅Artifacts generating in CI\r\n❌WIP\r\n\r\n## Jenkins Updates\r\n* [New docs folder pipelines to generate artifacts for each docs package](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/docs-pipelines/) - also has an MXNet binary build pipeline that can be used to share the latest binary as an archived artifact.\r\n* [Publish job](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/test-website-publish/) - takes artifacts from the docs pipelines, collates the website and publishes it to incubator-mxnet-site.\r\n  * using the last successful build URLs for each pipeline assures that the website gets published even if one docs package is failing\r\n* Dockerfile updates - to speed up testing, each docs package has a custom dockerfile that only installs dependencies required for that specific package rather than installing everything (as is done now).\r\n* New Python and R sites use Conda, so miniconda Python deps are installed with conda now.\r\n* New support for Jekyll: Docker container and related runtime functions\r\n\r\n## Preview\r\nThe publishing job uses CI artifacts generated from my fork of mxnet and pushes to my fork of mxnet-site, and you can see the output on a dev server here:\r\nhttp://54.211.76.74/\r\n\r\n## TODO when this PR is approved\r\n\r\n* Add notifications for when docs package builds fail.\r\n* Convert test pipelines to production website deployment flows.\r\n* Upload old version artifacts.\r\n* New PR triggering of a website test\r\n* Switch to GPU builds for the Python docs, so the outputs are in the tutorials\r\n\r\n## Comments\r\n* Stash operations vs. archiving - recommendations in the docs suggest that large artifacts should be archived; stash is super slow; archived artifacts seems to be faster and can be used between pipelines. This is helpful for the MXNet binary and for the Scala package, both of which are used by various other docs packages. However, there's an implication with the master server. Archived artifacts are stored there, so if the pipeline is related to PR validation, this would be unwieldy. If related to publishing final artifacts for specific versions, well, that's probably ok.\r\n* It seems that efficiency in development and testing can be gained by checkpointing the docker containers after the dependencies are installed.\r\n* A version/branch parameter would be useful for the Jenkins pipelines for generating docs artifacts from different branches.\r\n* Publishing scripts seem to need a security refactor, or we don't bother offering stand-alone access to them; running local versus on Jenkins.\r\n* A bug bash is needed on the new Python docs - I turned off \"warnings as errors\" just so I could get this thing working, but that needs to be turned back on.","created_at":"2019-07-26T19:28:53Z","updated_at":"2019-08-16T08:08:56Z","closed_at":"2019-08-16T08:08:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d5bb994345da440e9135f244fb31b70b08e5c43d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ThomasDelteil","id":3716307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTYzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3716307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil","html_url":"https://github.com/ThomasDelteil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":588394144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODgzOTQxNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Doc","name":"Doc","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":823354603,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjMzNTQ2MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/CI","name":"CI","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

In order to use standalone int8 batch norm instead of fused fp32 batch norm, one should `export MXNET_DISABLE_MKLDNN_FUSE_CONV_BN=1` before using `imagenet_gen_qsym_mkldnn.py` to quantize the model.\r\n3. Suggest to use fuse bn if it can be fused, since it's faster and more accurate. Otherwise use standalone int8 bn.\r\n\r\n### Limitation ###\r\n1. Currently int8 bn only support s8 input, since mkldnn batch norm only support s8 input\r\n2. Currently int8 bn cannot support `calib_mode = none`, since when calculating the thresholds on the fly with s8 input, errors are large. One can run with `calib_mode=naïve/entropy`, should have a similar accuracy with fp32 model.\r\n\r\n### Performance ###\r\nI tested several models on skylake, which can be used for reference.\r\n\r\nModels | FP32 Acc |  INT8 (fuse fp32 bn)  Acc | INT8 (standalone int8 bn) Acc\r\n-|-|-|-\r\nResnet50 V1 | 0.765 | 0.760 | 0.751\r\nMobilenet1.0 | 0.722 | 0.720 | 0.677\r\nInception V3 | 0.782 | 0.782 | 0.772\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-26T07:42:22Z","updated_at":"2019-08-08T10:20:20Z","closed_at":"2019-08-08T10:20:20Z","merged_at":"2019-08-08T10:20:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"b6972bb055fc44481b072db3abb90e26ee27c787","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":993234718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTMyMzQ3MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Backend","name":"Backend","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

Description ##\r\nImplement basic slicing in symbolic interface\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Add **npx_slice** to support the same kind of slicing in ndarray\r\n- Add **npx_reshape** to support reshape with special flags  \r\n    - -1 to infer this dimension from the other given dimensions\r\n    - -2 copy the current dimension from the input to the output\r\n    - -3 skip the current dimension if and only if the current dimension is of size 1, report an error otherwise\r\n    - -4 copy all remaining dimensions from the input to the output\r\n    - -5 use the product of the next two consecutive dimensions in the output\r\n    - -6 split current dimension in the output into the next two  dimensions in the input\r\n\r\n- Implement basic slicing in __symbol.py_ : \\_\\_getitem\\_\\_, basic slicing means slicing with \r\n    - an integer \r\n    - a pyslice\r\n    - a tuple of integers and pyslices\r\n\r\nA flag `_output_is_list` is added to symbol class in the frontend to differentiate the cases in which a symbol with only one output Node is conceptually a list, eg: `split(x, 1)`\r\n\r\n- Overload the `Group` function in Symbol\r\n- Overload the `save`, `save_json_string`, `load`, `load_json_string` to specially take care of the newly added flag\r\n\r\n## Comments \r\nBased on the current implementation, any operator that generates a list-like output should register their name in the list `python/mxnet/base.py:_NP_OUTPUT_IS_LIST_OPERATORS`\r\n\r\nThank @reminisce and @haojin2 for

Description ##\r\nFixes #15636 \r\nNewly add PDF Random ops - https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14617\r\nCaused the opperf.py to error out due to parameter issues.\r\nHence added new param `sample` to handle that\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] added param\r\nHad to add a param Sample (of type NDArray) so as to cater to all the random_pdf_* functions.\r\nMoreover, I tried playing with different shapes and dimensions. Based of various functions and their definitions, it turns out (2,) is the one-size-fits-all solution. Different functions have different requirement and hence its tough to come up with larger shapes that won't give error on any of these functions.\r\n \r\n## Comments ##\r\nRan `python benchmark/opperf/opperf.py` successfully without error on CPU & GPU\r\n\r\n## Error resolved ##\r\nIf you checkout master and run `python benchmark/opperf/opperf.py`\r\nWill give you following

Description ##\r\nThis PR introduces a graph pass that eliminates redundant common expressions in the graph. \r\n\r\nFor example, let's look at the graph created from a following Python code:\r\n```\r\na = mx.sym.Variable()\r\nout = (a + 5) * (a + 5)\r\n```\r\nThis graph will compute `a+5` twice, which is wasteful. After the pass introduced in this PR, the actual executed graph will be equivalent to\r\n```\r\na = mx.sym.Variable()\r\nb = a + 5\r\nout = b * b\r\n```\r\nwhich computes the `a+5` only once.\r\n\r\n@eric-haibin-lin FYI\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on

Description ##\r\nAs title. Making up for some omitted test during development.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] np.transpose unit test\r\n- [x] npx.relu unit test\r\n- [x] npx.sigmoid unit test\r\n- [x] np.reshape unit test\r\n- [ ] np.maximum unit test\r\n- [ ] np.minimum unit test\r\n- [x] np.flatten unit test\r\n- [ ] np.broadcast_to unit test\r\n- [ ] np.meshgrid unit test\r\n- [ ] np.broadcast_arrays unit test\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis factors out code in a separate PR as requested here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14779\r\n\r\nThe refactor extracts logic to get the product shapes for the two fully\r\nconnected branches, flattened and unflattened inputs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-22T18:30:03Z","updated_at":"2019-07-30T19:06:15Z","closed_at":"2019-07-30T19:06:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e53a9564c20c19a613691bc400176f90ddd0feb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThere is a behavior regression on LinearRegressionOutput after this CR: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/commit/3f3ba92ae1468d08de088d2291ca14e2d5dc5515#diff-726d19e2c39201681813130c8e2ac154\r\n\r\nThe previous CR changes the default TShape::ndim() to -1 instead of 0 but LinearRegressionOutput layer is not updated to handle new behavior of TShape.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ x ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ x ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ x ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ x ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ x ] cpp-package/examples/test_regress_label.cpp (test whether bind still works when regress_label is not provided to LinearRegressionOutput

Description ##\r\nAdd NaiveEnginePerThread to support multi-thread inference. To address the engine issue for https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/15576\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-19T06:19:58Z","updated_at":"2019-09-16T07:00:53Z","closed_at":"2019-07-22T05:46:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"89cdf1562b9aa8451492cf026993000d14b1d6af","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":852161716,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTIxNjE3MTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Thread%20Safety","name":"Thread

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-17T18:41:19Z","updated_at":"2019-07-22T01:42:15Z","closed_at":"2019-07-22T01:41:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8ef759f369ab97a8081e7a599dea0ff855e62cbe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":850606468,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTA2MDY0Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Profiler","name":"Profiler","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"MXNet

Description ##\r\nIn the [cpp example of image classification](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/example/image-classification/predict-cpp), `MXPredCreateMultiThread` is used to perform multi-threaded inference with naive engine. The `req_completed_` variable in naive engine is not thread-safe, which is fixed in this PR.\r\n\r\nThe problem is reported in #8966.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2,
