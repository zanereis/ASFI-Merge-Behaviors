In the case of empty partition, consumer.seek() should not be called - letting it fallback to the \"auto.offset.reset\" behaviour. The user should be notified by it.\r\n\r\n**Implementation comments:**\r\n\r\n- System.out.println was used instead of log.warn - since the whole class uses syso for interacting with the user.\r\n- There was no test for empty partition on reset to offset [streamsResetter.resetOffsetsTo()]. Test was added.\r\n- Added test for empty partition when resetToDatetime() is called - that was the cause of the bug.\r\n- MockConsumer doesn't have an implementation of offsetsForTimes() method - it throws an exception when called, breaching Liskov Substitution Principle. This method is used by resetToDatetime(). Since I couldn't find Mockito in the project dependencies to make a Spy, I decided to extends the MockConsumer class as a nested class and especialize the method.\r\n- Looking at Gradle, I saw that the min. java version is 1.8 - thus is decided to use 1.8 implementation of Optional instead of 1.9 - which would be a lot cleaner specially for the Optional.ProcessOrElse(). \r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer

[KAFKA-12259](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12259).\r\n\r\nProblem: when calling the connect status endpoint, a 500 error is returned, e.g.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"error_code\": 500,\r\n  \"message\": \"Could not read properties from file /tmp/somefile.properties\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhen any of the connector's has an exception from the config provider. This is because the `AbstractHerder` is trying to use resolved config. However, only the `connector.class` is needed from the config to infer if this connector is of source or sink type. The endpoint should still return the status of the connector instead of a 500 error.\r\n\r\nThis change uses raw config from the config backing store to retrieve the connector class to avoid any variable resolution.\r\n\r\nUnit tests have been updated to reflect this change.\r\n\r\nwhen any of the connector's has an exception from the config provider. \r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

log recovery begins as soon as we instantiate `LogManager`, but when using a Raft-based metadata quorum we won't have configs until after we catch up on the metadata log.  We therefore defer log recovery until we actually invoke `startup()` on the `LogManager` instance.  This timing difference has no effect when using ZooKeeper because we immediately invoke `startup()` on the instantiated instance, but it gives us the necessary flexibility for accurate log recovery with updated configs when using a Raft-based metadata quorum.\r\n\r\nThe `LogCleaner` is currently instantiated during construction just after log recovery completes, and then it is started in `startup()`.  As an extra precaution, since we are no longer performing recovery during construction, we both instantiate and start the log cleaner in `startup()` after log recovery completes.\r\n\r\nWe also convert `LogManager` to use a `ConfigRepository` to load topic configs (which can override the default log configs) instead of having a hard-coded dependency on ZooKeeper.  We retrieve the topic configs when we invoke `startup()` -- which again is effectively no different from a timing perspective than what we do today for the ZooKeeper case.\r\n\r\nOne subtlety is that currently we create the log configs for every topic at this point -- if a topic has no config overrides then we associate a copy of the default configuration with the topic inside a map, and we retrieve the log configs for that topic's partitions from from that map during recovery.  This PR makes a change to this series of events as follows.  We do not associate a copy of the the default configuration with a topic in the map if the topic has no configs set when we query for them.  This saves some memory -- we don't unnecessarily copy the default config many times -- but it also means we have use the default log configs for that topic later on when recovery for each of its partitions begins.\r\n\r\nThe difference is that the default configs are dynamically reconfigurable, and they could potentially change between the time when we invoke `startup()` and when log recovery begins (log recovery can begin quite some time after `startup()` is invoked if shutdown was unclean).  Prior to this patch such a change would not be used; with this patch they could be if they happen before recovery begins.  This actually is better -- we are performing log recovery with the most recent known defaults when a topic had no overrides at all. Also, `Partition.createLog` has logic to handle missed config updates, so the behavior is eventually the same.\r\n\r\nThe transition of the broker state from `STARTING` to `RECOVERY` currently happens within the `LogManager`, and it only occurs if the shutdown was unclean.  We move this transition into the broker as it avoids passing a reference to the broker state into the `LogManager`.  We also now always transition the broker into the `RECOVERY` state as dictated by [the KIP-631 broker state machine](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-631%3A+The+Quorum-based+Kafka+Controller#KIP631:TheQuorumbasedKafkaController-TheBrokerStateMachine).\r\n\r\nFinally, a few clean-ups were included. One worth highlighting is that `Partition` no longer requires a `ConfigRepository`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

is option #2 for the fix, which is a bit more ideal since no additional admin client calls are made. See #10027 for option 1 that is simpler but results in additional admin client calls.**_\r\n\r\nWhen a source connector is configured to create missing topics has multiple tasks that generate records for the same topic, it is possible that multiple tasks may simultaneously describe the topic, find it does not exist, and attempt to create the task. One of those create topic requests will succeed, and the other concurrent tasks will receive the response from the topic admin as having not created the task and will fail unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nThis change corrects the logic by moving the `TopicAdmin` logic to create a topic to a new `createOrFindTopics(…)` method that returns the set of created topic names and the set of existing topic names. This allows the existing `createTopics(…)` and `createTopic(…)` methods to retain the same behavior, but also allows the `WorkerSourceTask` to know from its single call to this new method whether the topic was created or was found to exist.\r\n\r\nThis adds one unit test and modifies several unit tests in `WorkerSourceTaskWithTopicCreationTest` that use mocks to verify the behavior, and modifies

KafkaEventQueue, which is used by the KIP-500 controller to manage its event queue. Compared to using an Executor, KafkaEventQueue has the following advantages:\r\n\r\n* Events can be given \"deadlines.\"  If an event lingers in the queue beyond the deadline, it will be completed with a timeout exception.  This is useful for implementing timeouts for controller RPCs.\r\n\r\n* Events can be prepended to the queue as well as appended.\r\n\r\n* Events can be given tags to make them easier to manage.  This is especially useful for rescheduling or cancelling events which were previously scheduled to execute in the future.","created_at":"2021-02-03T00:00:50Z","updated_at":"2021-02-04T22:46:58Z","closed_at":"2021-02-04T22:46:58Z","merged_at":"2021-02-04T22:46:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"d98df7fc4d968e46a130d23e2c01ef861924d7d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10030/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10030/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10030/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/809725cd0214ebf9cc400db54750ca56177c15a3","head":{"label":"cmccabe:event_queue","ref":"event_queue","sha":"809725cd0214ebf9cc400db54750ca56177c15a3","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

is option 1 for the fix, which is simpler but less ideal because it results in an extra admin client call. See #10032 for option 2 that is a bit more complicated but results in no extra admin client calls._**\r\n\r\nWhen a source connector is configured to create missing topics has multiple tasks that generate records for the same topic, it is possible that multiple tasks may simultaneously describe the topic, find it does not exist, and attempt to create the task. One of those create topic requests will succeed, and the other concurrent tasks will receive the response from the topic admin as having not created the task and will fail unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nThis change corrects the logic after the create topic method returns false (signifying that it did not create the task) to check again whether the topic exists (i.e., was created since the worker task last described the topic) and to continue if it does exist and fail only if the topic did not exist after the second check. This is not as efficient as would be ideal, but this ensures that tasks do not fail in this race condition and that tasks will continue to fail if the topic could not be created and did not exist after the create topic request did not create the topic.\r\n\r\nModified one unit test that mocks the behavior, and added a new test with the new behavior.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

involving `BrokerToControllerChannelManager` are simplified by being able to leverage `MockClient`. This patch introduces a `MockBrokerToControllerChannelManager` implementation which makes that possible.\r\n\r\nThe patch updates `ForwardingManagerTest` to use `MockBrokerToControllerChannelManager`. We also add a couple additional timeout cases, which exposed a minor bug. Previously we were using the wrong `TimeoutException`, which meant that expected timeout errors were in fact translated to `UNKNOWN_SERVER_ERROR`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

broker reconfiguration needs to occur for both ZooKeeper-based brokers and brokers that use a Raft-based metadata quorum.  `DynamicBrokerConfig` currently operates on `KafkaServer`, but it needs to operate on `BrokerServer` (the broker implementation that will use the Raft metadata log) as well.

a source task produces records for a topic that doesn't exist on the Kafka cluster and automatic topic creation is disabled on the broker and not configured à la [KIP-158](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-158%3A+Kafka+Connect+should+allow+source+connectors+to+set+topic-specific+settings+for+new+topics) on the connector, the task hangs indefinitely until and unless the topic is created. Even if the task is scheduled for shutdown by the worker, it continues to hang; the `SourceTask` instance isn't stopped and the producer isn't closed.\r\n\r\nOne possible approach to handle this situation is to proactively close the producer for the task when it is abandoned after exceeding the graceful shutdown timeout period. This can increase the likelihood of duplicate records for tasks that are blocked on shutdown for other reasons (high throughput, for example), as offsets will not be committed for any outstanding batches. However, given that the Connect framework's overall delivery guarantees of Connect source connectors still remain intact with this approach (either at-least-once or at-most-once, but not exactly-once), the tradeoff seems acceptable in order to prevent resource leaks that, if stacked over a long enough period, will require worker restarts to deal with.\r\n\r\nAn existing unit test for the `WorkerSourceTask` class is expanded to ensure that the producer is closed when the task is abandoned, and a new integration test is added that guarantees that tasks are still shut down even when their producers are trying to write to topics that do not exist.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage

expiration instead of just the leader.\r\n- To address `KAFKA-12252`, a conditional check is added in the herder tick thread to only cut rebalance polling short for key rotation if the worker is the leader.\r\n\r\nUnit tests for the distributed herder are added for both bugs. The first ensures that if a worker becomes the leader after reading a session key from the config topic, it wakes up from polling for rebalance in time for key rotation. The second ensures that if a worker loses leadership, it stops taking key expiration into account when calculating the time to poll for rebalance.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

objects are able to retrieve topic configs when creating their log, and currently they do so with an implementation of `trait TopicConfigFetcher` that uses ZooKeeper.  ZooKeeper is not available when using a Raft-based metadata log, so we need to abstract the retrieval of configs so it can work either with or without ZooKeeper.  This PR introduces `trait ConfigRepository` with `ZkConfigRepository` and `CachedConfigRepository` implementations.  `Partition` objects now use a provided `ConfigRepository` to retrieve topic configs, and we eliminate `TopicConfigFetcher` as it is no longer needed.\r\n\r\n`ReplicaManager` now contains an instance of `ConfigRepository` so it can provide it when creating `Partition` instances.\r\n\r\n`KafkaApis` needs to be able to handle describe-config requests; it currently delegates that to `ZkAdminManager`, which of course queries ZooKeeper.  To make this work with or without ZooKeeper we move the logic from `ZkAdminManager` into a new `ConfigHelper` class that goes through a `ConfigRepository` instance.  We provide `KafkaApis` with such an instance, and it creates an instance of the helper so it can use that instead of going through `ZkAdminManager`.\r\n\r\nExisting tests are sufficient to identify bugs and regressions in `Partition`, `ReplicaManager`, `KafkaApis`, and `ConfigHelper`.  The `ConfigRepository` implementations have their own unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage

receive metadata from the Raft metadata quorum very differently than they do from ZooKeeper today, and this has implications for ReplicaManager.  In particular, when a broker reads the metadata log it may not arrive at the ultimate state for a partition until it reads multiple messages.  In normal operation the multiple messages associated with a state change will all appear in a single batch, so they can and will be coalesced and applied together.  There are circumstances where messages associated with partition state changes will appear across multiple batches and we will be forced to coalesce these multiple batches together.  The circumstances when this occurs are as follows:\r\n\r\n- When the broker restarts it must \"catch up\" on the metadata log, and it is likely that the broker will see multiple partition state changes for a single partition across different batches while it is catching up.  For example, it will see the `TopicRecord` and the `PartitionRecords` for the topic creation, and then it will see any `IsrChangeRecords` that may have been recorded since the creation.  The broker does not know the state of the topic partitions until it reads and coalesces all the messages.\r\n- The broker will have to \"catch up\" on the metadata log if it becomes fenced and then regains its lease and resumes communication with the metadata quorum.\r\n- A fenced broker may ultimately have to perform a \"soft restart\" if it was fenced for so long that the point at which it needs to resume fetching the metadata log has been subsumed into a metadata snapshot and is no longer independently fetchable.  A soft restart will entail some kind of metadata reset based on the latest available snapshot plus a catchup phase to fetch after the snapshot end point.\r\n\r\nThe first case -- during startup -- occurs before clients are able to connect to the broker.  Clients are able to connect to the broker in the second case.  It is unclear if clients will be able to to connect to the broker during a soft restart (the third case).\r\n\r\nWe need a way to defer the application of topic partition metadata in all of the above cases, and while we are deferring the application of the metadata the broker will not service clients for the affected partitions.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, it is arguable if the broker should be able to service clients while catching up or not.  The decision to not service clients has no impact in the startup case -- clients can't connect yet at that point anyway.  In the third case it is not yet clear what we are going to do, but being unable to service clients while performing a soft reset seems reasonable.  In the second case it is most likely true that we will catch up quickly; it would be unusual to reestablish communication with the metadata quorum such that we gain a new lease and begin to catch up only to lose our lease again.\r\n\r\nSo we need a way to defer the application of partition metadata and make those partitions unavailable while deferring state changes.  This PR adds a new internal partition state to ReplicaManager to accomplish this.  Currently the available partition states are simple `Online`, `Offline` (meaning a log dir failure) and `None` (meaning we don't know about it).  We add a new `Deferred` state.  We also rename a couple of methods that refer to \"nonOffline\" partitions to instead refer to \"online\" partitions.\r\n\r\n**The new `Deferred` state never happens when using ZooKeeper for metadata storage.** Partitions can only enter the `Deferred` state when using a KIP-500 Raft metadata quorum and one of the above 3 cases occurs.  The testing strategy is therefore to leverage existing tests to confirm that there is no functionality change in the ZooKeeper case.  We will add the logic for deferring/applying/reacting to deferred partition state in separate PRs since that code will never be invoked in the ZooKeeper world.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

I'm passing in a SchemaBuilder for schema, and this will always throw an exception since it's doing an equals comparison. The reason that I need to pass in a builder is because my schema contains possibilities for a graph, and the only way to represent this is with SchemaBuilder since ConnectSchema is not

PR adds a set of annotations that can be used to generate one or more Kafka clusters for integration testing. The primary motivation for this is to reuse existing integration tests for both Zk and Raft based Kafka clusters. A secondary motivation is to refactor the complex test hierarchy that exists and instead provide reusable functionality to tests through helper classes.\r\n\r\n# Annotations\r\n\r\nA new `@ClusterTest` annotation is introduced which allows for a test to declaratively configure an underlying Kafka cluster.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n@ClusterTest\r\ndef testSomething(): Unit = { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis annotation has fields for cluster type and number of brokers, as well as commonly parameterized configurations. Arbitrary server properties can also be provided in the annotation:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@ClusterTest(clusterType = Type.Zk, securityProtocol = \"PLAINTEXT\", properties = {\r\n  @ClusterProperty(key = \"inter.broker.protocol.version\", value = \"2.7-IV2\"),\r\n  @ClusterProperty(key = \"socket.send.buffer.bytes\", value = \"10240\"),\r\n})\r\nvoid testSomething() { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nMultiple `@ClusterTest` annotations can be given to generate more than one test invocation for the annotated method.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n@ClusterTests(Array(\r\n    @ClusterTest(securityProtocol = \"PLAINTEXT\"),\r\n    @ClusterTest(securityProtocol = \"SASL_PLAINTEXT\")\r\n))\r\ndef testSomething(): Unit = { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nA class-level `@ClusterTestDefaults` annotation is added to provide default values for `@ClusterTest` defined within the class. The intention here is to reduce repetitive annotation declarations and also make changing defaults easier for a class with many test cases.\r\n\r\n# Dynamic Configuration\r\n\r\nIn order to allow for more flexible cluster configuration, a `@ClusterTemplate` annotation is also introduced. This annotation takes a single string value which references a static method on the test class. This method is used to produce any number of test configurations using a fluent builder style API.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@ClusterTemplate(\"generateConfigs\")\r\nvoid testSomething() { ... }\r\n\r\nstatic void generateConfigs(ClusterGenerator clusterGenerator) {\r\n  clusterGenerator.accept(ClusterConfig.defaultClusterBuilder()\r\n      .name(\"Generated Test 1\")\r\n      .serverProperties(props1)\r\n      .ibp(\"2.7-IV1\")\r\n      .build());\r\n  clusterGenerator.accept(ClusterConfig.defaultClusterBuilder()\r\n      .name(\"Generated Test 2\")\r\n      .serverProperties(props2)\r\n      .ibp(\"2.7-IV2\")\r\n      .build());\r\n  clusterGenerator.accept(ClusterConfig.defaultClusterBuilder()\r\n      .name(\"Generated Test 3\")\r\n      .serverProperties(props3)\r\n      .build());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis \"escape hatch\" from the simple declarative style configuration makes it easy to dynamically configure clusters.\r\n\r\n\r\n# JUnit Extension\r\n\r\nOne thing to note is that our \"test*\" methods are no longer _tests_, but rather they are test templates. We have added a JUnit extension called `ClusterForEach` which knows how to process these annotations in order to generate test invocations. Test classes that wish to make use of these annotations need to explicitly register this extension:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n@ExtendWith(value = Array(classOf[ClusterForEach]))\r\nclass ApiVersionsRequestTest {\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# JUnit Lifecycle\r\n\r\nThe lifecycle of a test class that is extended with `ClusterForEach` follows:\r\n\r\n* JUnit discovers test template methods that are annotated with `@ClusterTest`, `@ClusterTests`, or `@ClusterTemplate`\r\n* `ClusterForEach` is called for each of these template methods in order to generate some number of test invocations\r\n\r\nFor each generated invocation:\r\n* Static `@BeforeAll` methods are called\r\n* Test class is instantiated\r\n* Non-static `@BeforeEach` methods are called\r\n* Kafka Cluster is started\r\n* Test method is invoked\r\n* Kafka Cluster is stopped\r\n* Non-static `@AfterEach` methods are called\r\n* Static `@AfterAll` methods are called\r\n\r\n`@BeforeEach` methods give an opportunity to setup additional test dependencies before the cluster is started. For example, in [SaslApiVersionsRequestTest](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9986/files#diff-ba6b8459d0e1cb7e5672a259b8e58fa066ca3d656f71c79d3da809d6da6c4a33), a MiniKDC is started before Kafka comes up (in order to provide a SASL backend). As seen in the example `@BeforeEach` (and other places) can have parameters which are provided through JUnit dependency injection.\r\n\r\n# Dependency Injection\r\n\r\nA few classes are introduced to provide context to the underlying cluster and to provide reusable functionality that was previously garnered from the test hierarchy. \r\n\r\n* ClusterConfig: a mutable cluster configuration, includes cluster type, number of brokers, properties, etc\r\n* ClusterInstance: a shim to the underlying class that actually runs the cluster, provides access to things like SocketServers\r\n* IntegrationTestHelper: connection related functions taken from IntegrationTestHarness and BaseRequestTest\r\n\r\nIn order to have one of these objects injected, simply add it as a parameter to your test class, `@BeforeEach` method, or test method. \r\n\r\n| Injection | Class | BeforeEach | Test | Notes\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| ClusterConfig | yes | yes | yes* | Once in the test, changing config has no effect |\r\n| ClusterInstance | yes* | no | yes | Injectable at class level for convenience, can only be accessed inside test |\r\n| IntegrationTestHelper | yes | yes | yes | - |\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n@ExtendWith(value = Array(classOf[ClusterForEach]))\r\nclass SomeTestClass(helper: IntegrationTestHelper) {\r\n \r\n  @BeforeEach\r\n  def setup(config: ClusterConfig): Unit = {\r\n    config.serverProperties().put(\"foo\", \"bar\")\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @ClusterTest\r\n  def testSomething(cluster: ClusterInstance): Unit = {\r\n    val topics = cluster.createAdminClient().listTopics()\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Gradle\r\n\r\nIn order to overcome some compilation issues, the core module test compile phase is now using the Scala compile for both Java and Scala sources. This is because the new annotations and JUnit extension are written in Java, but depend on some Scala classes in \"core\".\r\n\r\n```gradle\r\n    test {\r\n      java {\r\n        srcDirs = []\r\n      }\r\n      scala {\r\n        srcDirs = [\"src/generated/java\", \"src/test/java\", \"src/test/scala\"]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince most of the core module test sources are Scala already, this should have little impact on build time. \r\n\r\n# KIP-500\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, one of the main motivations of this work is to allow for easy reuse of test code between Raft and Zk modes. This will be accomplished using the `clusterType` field on the annotations. For example:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n@ClusterTest(clusterType=Type.Both)\r\ndef testSomething(): Unit = { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould generate two invocations: one for Zk and one for Raft. \r\n\r\nOnce more of the KIP-500 code is merged into trunk, we will add a Raft-based test invocation context.

stabilize the task assignment across restarts of the JVM we need some way to persist the process-specific UUID. We can just write it to a file in the state directory, and initialize it from there or create a new one if no prior UUID exists. \r\n\r\nThis also adds a state directory-level lock -- partly to protect the \"process file\" where we write the UUID, and partly to address an issue that has been plaguing users for a long time: with this top-level lock, we can now strictly enforce that only one instance of Streams is running on the same physical state directory. This configuration has never been supported, but it's never been explicitly protected against, leading to often murky symptoms such as tasks being stuck uninitialized. With this change, we will fail fast if another process holds the lock for this state

some previously-flaky PlaintextAdminIntegrationTests.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the flakiness appears to have been lack of test isolation between those tests and other tests which manipulate log levels (which are effectively global to the JVM). In general there are quite a few tests which manipulate log4j and/or make assertions on log4j global state, so introduce some of helpers to try to get test isolation across the whole of the broker code.\r\n\r\n1. `logLock` in `TestUtils` provides the mutual exclusion. We can't use `synchronized` on an `Object` because some tests change the logging in their `@Before(Class)` and restore in ``@After(Class)`.\r\n2. `TestUtils.withLogLock` encapsulates the isolation logic, and it used by most of the log-changing tests, rather than them using `logLock` directly.\r\n3. `LogCaptureAppender` now uses `withLogLock` too, and there's no reason not to apply the same state management pattern via `captureLogging`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-26T10:02:38Z","updated_at":"2024-12-01T18:37:10Z","closed_at":"2024-12-01T18:37:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

pull request back-ports to 2.6 the changes I contributed in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9947.\r\n\r\nPreviously, `StateDirectory` used `PosixFilePermissions` to configure its directories' permissions which fails on Windows as its file system is not POSIX-compliant. This PR updates `StateDirectory` to fall back to the `File` API on non-POSIX-compliant file systems. The File API doesn't allow as much control over the permissions so they're as close as the API permits.\r\n\r\nThe unit tests have been updated to also verify the behaviour on non-POSIX-compliant file systems.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

patch contains the new handling of `meta.properties` required by the KIP-500 server as specified in KIP-631. When using the self-managed quorum, the `meta.properties` file is required in each log directory with the new `version` property set to 1. It must include the `cluster.id` property and it must have a `node` matching that in the configuration.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of `meta.properties` for the Zookeeper-based `KafkaServer` does not change. We treat `meta.properties` as optional and as if it were `version=0`. We continue to generate the clusterId and/or the brokerId through Zookeeper as needed.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

we implement KIP-511, we put the logic to extract the `SoftwareName` and the `SoftwareVersion` from the `ApiVersionsRequest` in the `SocketServer` to avoid having to wire the `ChannelMetadataRegistry`

is a continuation of a refactor started in #9952. The logic in `GroupCoordinator` is loose and inconsistent in the handling of the `groupInstanceId`. In some cases, such as in the JoinGroup hander, we verify that the groupInstanceId from the request is mapped to the memberId precisely. In other cases, such as Heartbeat, we check the mapping, but only to validate fencing. The patch consolidates the member validation so that all handlers follow the same logic. \r\n\r\nA second problem is that many of the APIs where a `groupInstanceId` is expected use optional arguments. For example:\r\n```scala\r\ndef hasStaticMember(groupInstanceId: Option[String]): Boolean\r\n\r\ndef addStaticMember(groupInstanceId: Option[String], newMemberId: String): Unit\r\n```\r\nIf `groupInstanceId` is `None`, then `hasStaticMember` is guaranteed to return `false` while `addStaticMember` raises an `IllegalStateException`. So the APIs suggest a generality which is not supported and does not make sense.\r\n\r\nFinally,  the patch attempts to introduce stronger internal  invariants inside `GroupMetadata`. Currently it is possible for an inconsistent `groupInstanceId` to `memberId` mapping to exist because we expose separate APIs to modify `members` and `staticMembers`. We rely on the caller to ensure this doesn't happen.  Similarly, it is possible for a member to be in the `pendingMembers` set as well as the stable `members` map. The patch fixes this by consolidating the paths to addition and removal from these collections and adding assertions to ensure that invariants are maintained. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

FetchRequest and FetchResponse to use topic IDs rather than topic names. \r\nSome of the complicated code is found in FetchSession and FetchSessionHandler.\r\nWe need to be able to store topic IDs and maintain a cache on the broker for IDs that may not have been resolved. On incremental fetch requests, we will try to resolve them or remove them if in toForget.\r\n\r\nWe also need to check the topic IDs of the cachedPartitions. If the topic ID changed from when the partition was cached, the strategy here is to remove it from the session since we are operating on a stale partition.\r\n\r\nI have added tests to handle some of the edge cases where brokers have different IBP versions and some may have topic IDs while others do not.\r\n\r\nNewest benchmarks can be found below.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from
