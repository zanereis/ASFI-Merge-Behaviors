a symbolic operator for random number generation.\n\nOnly two types of random numbers are supported at the moment:\n1. Uniform U(0,1) random numbers.\n2. Normal N(0,1) random numbers.\n### Example\n\nTo use it, you currently need to supply the `num_output` argument to specify the size of the output.\nHere is an example Python code\n\n```\nimport mxnet as mx\n\nR = mx.sym.Random(num_output=32, random_type=\"gaussian\")\nA = mx.sym.Activation(data=R, act_type=\"relu\")\n\nA_exec = A.bind(ctx=mx.cpu(), args={})\nA_exec.forward()\nprint A_exec.outputs[0].asnumpy()\n```\n### This PR may not be ready for merging yet, for the following reasons:\n\nI have not found a way to do shape inference automatically because there are no inputs to this operator and the current `InferShape` interface seems to be purely feedforward.  I would appreciate any comment on how shape inference can be done automatically.\n### Rationale for Random layer\n\nI would like to use this operator for drawing random parameters of other layers, for example using `weights=R`, where `R` is a Random layer.  To make this convenient, in principle, the downstream layers (say, a fully connected layer) know the size of their parameter array and could \"backpropagate\" the shape information to the output of the Random layer, but this seems not supported by the InferShape interface at the moment.

the [_softplus_ activation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_%28neural_networks%29), named in [(Dugas et al., NIPS 2000)](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/1920-incorporating-second-order-functional-knowledge-for-better-option-pricing.pdf), defined as f(x)=log(1+exp(x)).\n\nOne note: I may have misunderstood how the pairs of functions and their gradients in `mshadow_op.h` are supposed to be used.  It seems there are two use cases which differ:\n1. Use case one: e.g. `tanh`, `sigmoid`, and now `softplus` have gradient functions which are not actually their gradient but instead the functions that when evaluated on the output of the basic operator result provides the gradient.  For example, if `a=tanh(x)` then `g=tanh_grad(a)` is the gradient of `tanh` at x.\n2. Use case two: e.g. `log` has a gradient `log_grad` which follows the canonical definition of the gradient, i.e. 1/x.\n\nIt may be worthwhile to replace the `_grad` suffix where needed with something that indicates the first use, for example `_gradfromresult` or similar.\n","created_at":"2015-11-27T23:13:54Z","updated_at":"2015-12-02T05:32:31Z","closed_at":"2015-11-28T21:31:20Z","merged_at":"2015-11-28T21:31:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"5aa9bc3bb4df725f26955fcf8c199063648e4eb8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/740/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/740/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/740/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/3310f5831589038337f261c8ddd4773f3675baef","head":{"label":"nowozin:softplus","ref":"softplus","sha":"3310f5831589038337f261c8ddd4773f3675baef","user":{"login":"nowozin","id":7673114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NzMxMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7673114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowozin","html_url":"https://github.com/nowozin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowozin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowozin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowozin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowozin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowozin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowozin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowozin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowozin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nowozin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"30d886f6c68766a60b829710423292a6f333511c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,
