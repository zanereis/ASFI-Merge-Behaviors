This almost always turns out to be a dependency conflict, that leads to automated downgrate or upgrade of installed airflow version. This is - obviously - undesired (you should be upgrading airflow consciously rather than accidentally). However there is no way to do it implicitly - `pip` might decide to upgrade or downgrade airflow as it sees fit. From the point of view - airflow is just one of the packages and has no special meaning.\r\n\r\nThe only way to \"keep\" airflow version is to specify it together with other requirements, pinned to the specific version. This PR updates our examples to do this and explains why airflow is added there.\r\n\r\nThere is - of course - another risk that the user will forget to update the version of airflow when they upgrade, however, sinc this is explicit action performed during image extension, it is much easier to diagnose and notice. We also warn the users that they should upgrade when airflow is upgraded.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

of the ongoing OTel implementation.  Should not contain any logic changes, just moving things around into a more modular \"plugin\" style layout like we have elsewhere instead of the \"monolithic\" [stats.py](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/stats.py) we currently have.\r\n\r\n@howardyoo and @potiuk: This is (my proposal for) the change we discussed yesterday.\r\n\r\n**Motivation**\r\n`airflow/stats.py` currently contains the metrics interface as well as implementations of the interface for StatsD and Datadog, some protocols, and validators (along with their interface).   This PR does not change any logic, simply moves related content into relevant modules.  For example All StatsD-specific code now lives in `airflow/metrics/statsd-logger.py`.  This is to make the stats.py file a bit cleaner, make adding OTel easier, and possibly make removing the StatsD easier later if we choose to go that route.\r\n\r\nWhen I add the OpenTelemetry code, it will live in `airflow/metrics/otel-logger.py`and simply import and implement the interfaces from `stats.py` and `metrics/protocols.py` instead of adding it to the existing growing monolith in `stats.py`.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nPasses `breeze static-checks --all-files` and `breeze testing tests --run-in-parallel` locally.\r\n\r\ncc:  @o-nikolas  @vincbeck @vandonr-amz @syedahsn

#30778\r\n\r\ncurretly for the operators sub class of `BaseOperator`, we provide the field value to super as `conn_id`  which is a template field, and the field is rendered in execution time and everything works fine, but in the `rendered-templates` view, we have the original field name with the jinja template before rendering.\r\n\r\nThis PR add a new field for `BaseOperator` to specify the conn field name, and use it directly from the ancestor with needing to provide it to parent class, then we can add the new conn field name to `template_fields` to render it.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-04-21 02-49-25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21311487/233516440-8b55d9f1-dcc2-4ec0-865f-e0964d0b94f4.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![Screenshot from

recent improvements, package wheel job has become one\r\nof the longest jobs to run. So far it sequentially build airlfow,\r\nprepared documentation for packages, build the packages\r\ninstalled both airflow and packages and tested imports for them, then it\r\nwas removing installed airlfow, removed airflow and run the same tests\r\nwith 2.3 airflow version to check for compatibility.\r\n\r\nThis change splits it into two parallel jobs. There is a small\r\nduplication (3 minutes of preparing the whl packages) but then\r\nthe \"compatibility\" job does not need Airflow and few other\r\nsteps to be run (such as preparing docs or airlfow) and overall\r\nwe just get few minutes longer to repeate the wheel package\r\npreparation but then each of the two jobs will take a bit more\r\nthan half the time of the original way, which will greately improve\r\nfeedback time for the users (in most cases the two jobs will complete\r\nunder 12 minutes, where the original job needed 21 minutes to complete.\r\n\r\nBased on #29223 so only last commit counts\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

This index seems to have great positive effect when querying this table in a setup with many millions such rows. Existing index `ti_state_lkp` is not heavily utilized, as the `start_date` column (not part of the existing index) needs to be selected, hence a sequential scan will be performed in a very large table. Including the `start_date` column makes a use of `INDEX ONLY SCAN`, which improves performance dramatically in such situations.\r\n\r\nThis change is applicable to PostgreSQL database backends only, as other databases do not support this feature.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more

PR aims to deprecate `DatabricksSubmitRunDeferrableOperator` and \r\n`DatabricksRunNowDeferrableOperator` and add a param `deferrable` in\r\n`DatabricksSubmitRunOperator` and `DatabricksRunNowOperator`. \r\nThe default value of the `deferrable` param is false.\r\n\r\nSince at most of the places for the async operator, we have deferrable param.\r\nso this will make the Databricks provider more consistent with other providers. \r\nIn future, we can remove the deprecated one so we will have fewer operators which is good.\r\nThis will also give a more logical easy way to navigate and figure out\r\n if the operator supports the deferrable mode or not and \r\nI can set deferrable=True/False dynamically for all operator in my dag \r\nif `deferrable` attr exist in the operator \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

used to have helper limits for eager upgrade of our packages but with 23.1 updated in #30663 pip has a much improved resolver that does not need that much of a help and can resolve our dependnecies pretty fast on its own, so we can remove all the dependecy limts that aimed to limit the dependency resolution time.\r\n\r\nAlso we used to have a mechanism to track backtracking issues and find out which of the new dependencies caused excessive backtracking. This seems to be not needed so we can remove it from CI and breeze.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

degraded/timeout scenario, in which case we really want to stop the app no matter what. It's nice to have an option to do that from the operator directly.\r\n\r\nNOTE: If extra jobs are launched after the stop/delete operator is called, then it's not going to work properly, and will likely end on a timeout in the waiter, but to support that we'd need to go back and forth between get_jobs and cancel_jobs, possibly never converging. \r\nI'm assuming that this is good enough for

#9461, #29088\r\n---\r\n- This PR removes the deprecated `delegate_to` parameter from GCP operators, hooks, sensors, transfers, and triggers, as well as from firebase hook. \r\n- It also removes the parameter from Microsoft Azure, Presto, Trino, and gsuite transfers that interact with Google Cloud.\r\n- The `delegate_to` param will still be available only in gsuite and marketing platform hooks, operators, sensors, and transfers that don't interact with Google Cloud (see reasoning in #9461).\r\n\r\n\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

we do not set the tries parameter in Databricks \r\nwhile initialising the hook from the trigger. This is problematic \r\nif the Databricks API throw error in the trigger and the error is retriable.\r\nIn this case, currently, we have a retry limit and the delay is fixed. \r\nThis PR allows the user to modify the retry limit and the delay as required.\r\nIn addition, I'm also pushing the job id in xcom for `DatabricksSubmitRunDeferrableOperator`\r\nso that other tasks can use the existing job_id from xcom if require.\r\nalso, add logs while waiting for completion \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

was no explicit information in our documentation on how to write logs from your tasks. While for classic operators, that is easy and straightforward as they all have log property which is the right logger coming from LoggingMixin, for taskflow code and custom classes it is is not straightforward that you have to use `airflow.task` logger (or a child of it) or that you have extend LoggingMixin to use the built-in logging configuration.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Overview\r\nThis PR aims to improve the time it takes to load/import the kubernetes executor module.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nExecutors are imported in more places now that various compatibility checks are in core Airflow code (re: AIP-51). Also, decreasing import times is very important for the work of executors vending CLI commands (see #29055), since the CLI code in Airflow is particularly sensitive to slow imports (because all code is loaded fresh each time you run an individual Airflow CLI command).\r\n\r\n### The changes\r\n\r\n1. Move some expensive typing related imports to be under TYPE_CHECKING.\r\n1. Refactor expensive classes (other than the `KubernetesExecutor`) out of the `kubernetes_executor.py` module into a utils module so they are only loaded at runtime. Classes moved include `KubernetesJobWatcher`,  `AirflowKubernetesScheduler`, `ResourceVersion`\r\n1. Also move some imports closer to their usage.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nI benchmarked these changes by writing a script to import the executor module in a fresh python runtime and timing how long that takes (you can test this yourself quickly from a bash shell by doing something like `time python -c 'from airflow.executors.local_executor import KubernetesExecutor'`). Then doing that in a loop for several samples (with some randomness in the order for fairness) both on main and on my development branch. \r\n\r\n### Results\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-04-21 17-16-13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65743084/233751454-2479ac2c-9500-465a-968b-83e54bbfce01.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

I'm going to continue our discussion of PRs here, as [previous PR](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30623)s have been corrupted by my bad work 😭 \r\n\r\nThis PR attaches the logGroomer sidecar pod when using a standalone dag processor. This is to prevent scheduler logs from growing infinitely in the logs directory of that dag processor pod.\r\n\r\nIn fact, one of the Airflow clusters my team uses had about 3.5 TiB of scheduler logs accumulated in the emptyDir of a dag processor pod, which reduced the ephemeral-storage availability on that node to the point of pod eviction, resulting in a pod eviction.\r\n\r\nairflow@airflow-test-dag-processor-78f9bfdb88-hmckb:/opt/airflow/logs$ ls\r\nscheduler\r\nairflow@airflow-test-dag-processor-78f9bfdb88-hmckb:/opt/airflow/logs$ du -sh\r\n3.5T\t     .\r\nWe haven't figured out why the standalone dag processor was accumulating scheduler logs, but we think it's a good idea to attach a logGroomer sidecar like any other scheduler pod or worker pod to prevent this from happening in the first place.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we've modified the helm chart to attach a logGroomer to the standalone dag processor.\r\n\r\nRead the [Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines) for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code changes, an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvement+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License

serverless currently has a `delete` operator that stops the app and deletes it, but there is no operator to just stop an app.\r\n\r\nSince the delete operator contains a stop step, to avoid duplicating the code, I made it inherit from the new stop operator.\r\nUsually, [composition is preferred over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance), but in this case, since they are operators, I cannot really create an operator inside another because an operator is an object that is more complex than just the action it executes. Creating an operator inside an other operator creates new tasks in the DAG, requires a different task_id, etc.\r\n\r\ntagging for visibility: @vincbeck @syedahsn @ferruzzi

base SqlExtractor. This provides base upon which extractors gathering data from operators which derive from `SQLExecuteQueryOperator` are build. This means\r\n - passing SQL to SQL parser with right options, like dialect\r\n - handling resulting data, constructing column level lineage facet\r\n - constructing query and querying database for schema for the used tables\r\n - handling errors \r\n\r\nThen those, like `PostgresExtractor`, `TrinoExtractor` or `RedshiftSqlExtractor` only need to define specifics for the particular database they work on, like how to get particular hook or what's the OpenLineage namespace for this particular database.\r\n\r\nRight now this PR cleanly derives on https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30713, and does not change files that previous PR changed - only adds `dbapi_utils.py` `sql_extractor.py` and corresponding

airflow community,\r\nthis is my third PR and be happy to work on the scheduler runtime again. We faced an issue with slow scheduler execution time by having millions of queued dag_runs for one DAG.\r\n\r\nOur DAG which runs millions of task is triggered external and has no interval or timetable. We think that DAGs which are running with interval or timetable will not create huge amount of dag_runs in queued state. But the idea is to improve the performance for the dag_runs for DAGs which have no interval or timetable by skipping the execution of calc_num_active_runs and _should_update_dag_next_dagruns if there is not timetable or interval. This also helped us to improve the scheduler execution time.\r\n\r\nSo I´m still new to Airflow coding and try to get thinks right. I hope it is possible to understand the idea behind the improvement. I´m open and looking for a nicer code to check for this, maybe you have nicer code solution to check for a DAG which has timetable or interval.\r\n\r\n@vandonr-amz fyi, as discussed with

are runnig the tests in parallel test types in order to speed\r\nup their execution. Howver some test types and subsets of tests\r\nare taking far longer to execute than other test types.\r\n\r\nThe longest tests to run are Providers and WWW tests, and the\r\nlongest tests from Providers are by far Amazon tests, then\r\nGoogle. \"All Other\" Provider tests take about the same time\r\nas Amazon tests - also after splitting the provider tests,\r\nCore tests take the longest time.\r\n\r\nWhen we are running tests in parallel on multiple CPUs, often\r\nthe longest running tests remain runing on their own while the\r\nother CPUS are not busy. We could run separate tests type\r\nper provider, but overhead of starting the database and collecting\r\nand initializing tests for them is too big for it to achieve\r\nspeedups - especially for Public runners, having 80 separate\r\ndatabases with 80 subsequent container runs is slower than\r\nrunning all Provider tests together.\r\n\r\nHowever we can split the Provider tests into smaller number of\r\nchunks and prioritize running the long chunks first. This\r\nshould improve the effect of parellelisation and improve utilization of\r\nour multi-CPU machines.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to do that:\r\n\r\n* Split Provider tests (if amazon or google are part of the\r\n  provider tests) into amazon, google, all-other chunks\r\n\r\n* Move sorting of the test types to selective_check, to sort the\r\n  test types according to expected longest running time (the longest\r\n  tests to run are added first)\r\n\r\nThis should improve the CPU utilization of our multi-CPU runners\r\nand make the tests involving complete Provider set (or even sets\r\ncontaining amazon, google and few other providers)\r\nexecute quite a few minutes faster on average.\r\n\r\nWe could also get rid of some sequential processing for the Public PRs\r\nbecause each test type we will run will be less demanding overall. We\r\nused to get a lot of 137 exit codes (memory errors) but with splitting\r\nout Providers, the risk of exhausting resources be two test types\r\nrunning in paralel are low.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

We faced an issue with slow scheduler execution time by having millions of queued dag_runs for one DAG. \r\n\r\nThis PR will add at 2 points in the code a caching of the dag. This saved a lot of scheduler runtime during scheduling many dag_runs for the same dag. The code currently reads the dag out of the DB and if you have a lot of short running tasks this is executed a lot. E.g. we wanted to schedule a DAG with:\r\nmax_active_tasks=60,\r\nmax_active_runs=180,\r\nand most tasks with an execution time of 2 sec and 1 million in queued state.  With the caching we were able to increase scheduler performance. Because the time on our slow DB to query the dag took between 50ms and 250ms and if you execute this only once or 60 times during one scheduler loop run this makes a big change.\r\n\r\n@vandonr-amz fyi, as discussed with @jens-scheffler-bosch","created_at":"2023-04-18T11:40:12Z","updated_at":"2023-10-28T17:28:59Z","closed_at":"2023-05-18T22:48:16Z","merged_at":"2023-05-18T22:48:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"e065f6a9f84a4af7080af1fa9116958a7890c0fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

airflow community,\r\nthis is my first PR and be happy to work on the scheduler runtime. We faced an issue with slow scheduler execution time by having millions of queued dag_runs for one DAG. This is the first PR and more is in the queue.\r\n\r\nThis PR will add .all() to query to match the pydantic definition of function and return only list of dag_runs. This optimize the scheduler runtime because without this change the query is executed 2 times in function _start_queued_dagruns in airflow/jobs/scheduler_job_runner.py. So this saves execution time in the scheduler. \r\n\r\n@vandonr-amz fyi, as discussed with @jens-scheffler-bosch

packages for \"Other\" test type are calculated, the list of all test folders is generated and they are compared with the packages previously selected by the \"predefined\" test types. This is done via `find` method that returns the folders in arbitrary order, mostly depending on the sequence the folders were created.\r\n\r\nIn case the tests from some packages have some side-effects that impact tests in other packages (obviously not something that is desired), this might end up that the tests succeed in one environment, but fail in another. This happened for example in case of #30362 that had cross-package side-effect later fixed in #30588. There - results of \"Other\" test type depended on where the tests were executed.\r\n\r\nThis PR sorts the find output so it is always in consistent order. we are using ASCII for package names and the test types are derived in the same Docker CI image with the same LOCALE, so it should guarantee that the output of packages for \"Other\" test type should be always consistent.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Unit tests are using template rendering and the rendering uses a lot of CPU for `helm template command`. We have a lot of those rendering tests (>800) so even running the tests in parallel on a multi-cpu machine does not lead to a decreased elapsed time to execute the tests.\r\n\r\nHowever, each of the tests is run entirely independently and we should be able to achieve much faster elapsed time if we run a subset of tetsts on separate, multi-CPU machine. This will not lower the job build time, however it might speed up elapsed time and thus get a faster feedback.\r\n\r\nThis PR achieves that.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

context, I'm a pretty new developer, but I personally had a bit of a hard time parsing the [Quick Start](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start.html) instructions with them in one giant code block and instead thought they were actually some sort of configuration file. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85081861/232335344-a1828b47-9657-423f-8be5-ac38375e2bc9.png)\r\n\r\nThe four changes that I'm suggesting in this all relate to the instructions found in the code block, they are - \r\n\r\n1. Breaking the code block up by step\r\n\r\n2. Including a note about setting the AIRFLOW_HOME variable before installation. This is pretty small but I think was part of what contributed to me being confused that this is not a config file as I'm not too used to setting environment variables for an application I haven't installed before.\r\n\r\n3. On step two, making a note/more explicit how the URL and constrain file ties together. That language of \"Install Airflow using the constraints file\", once I understood what was happening made total sense, but having the text be a bit more verbose would have saved me some time. My understanding at this time, which could be wrong (in which case I think that text still needs to be updated) is that our URL being passed will determine what constraint file to use.\r\n\r\n4. Making a note that the PYTHON_VERSION is being extracted as well as setting it manually if the user is running python 3.11 on their machine.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
