Description ##\r\nFallback dispatch mode when using MKLDNN LRN\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Fallback dispatch mode when using MKLDNN LRN\r\n- [ ] Add mkldnn unit test\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-12T21:37:41Z","updated_at":"2018-07-12T22:33:00Z","closed_at":"2018-07-12T22:33:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"84244ef11488bf983e1f3bb483e7a5e11a348d7e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11678/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11678/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11678/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/3ae21aee8773b09a81fe7d3970bf965cfb0292c5","head":{"label":"azai91:fallback-lrn","ref":"fallback-lrn","sha":"3ae21aee8773b09a81fe7d3970bf965cfb0292c5","user":{"login":"azai91","id":8272546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzI1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8272546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91","html_url":"https://github.com/azai91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":109348168,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDkzNDgxNjg=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"azai91/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"azai91","id":8272546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzI1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8272546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91","html_url":"https://github.com/azai91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/azai91/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nAfter adding kSubgraphExec, some logic in CachedOp is no longer valid. For example, an op executor that requires async execution may not contain output arrays. On the other hand, calling `CreateEngineOp` on op executors without output arrays can fail. This PR tries to fix this problem.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ## \r\nDocs building made easy... at least for Ubuntu.\r\nTested on a vanilla Ubuntu 16.04 instance.\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Fixes #11662 - adds Clojure docs build info\r\n- [x] Adds info on building R, Scala, or Doxygen docs manually\r\n- [x] Clarifies current Mac building situation\r\n- [x] Shows how to turn on or turn off building different API's docs\r\n- [x] MAKES DOCS BUILDING SUPER EASY!\r\n\r\n## Usage ##\r\n- Clone mxnet or your fork on your Ubuntu instance\r\n- Run the following to setup your instance's dependencies and build MXNet:\r\n```\r\ncd $MXNET_ROOT/docs/build_version_doc\r\n./setup_docs_ubuntu.sh\r\n```\r\nNote: you might want to turn on web server redirects - the script outputs directions on how to do this.\r\n- Run this after making updates or pulling the latest (be in `$MXNET_ROOT` directory):\r\n```\r\nmake docs USE_OPENMP=1\r\n```\r\n- View or serve the docs generated in `docs/_build/html/`. You can create a deploy.sh script like this to make it easy for you to build new docs & serve:\r\n```\r\nmake docs USE_OPENMP=1\r\nsudo rm -rf /var/www/html\r\nsudo cp -a docs/_build/html /var/www/\r\n```\r\nNote: if you run this on an existing server with old repo of mxnet laying around you might need to do the following from `$MXNET_ROOT`:\r\n```\r\ngit fetch upstream\r\ngit rebase upstream/master\r\ngit submodule update --recursive\r\ngit submodule init\r\nmake clean\r\n```\r\nThen run the `setup_docs_ubuntu.sh` script.","created_at":"2018-07-12T17:34:01Z","updated_at":"2018-07-25T00:13:37Z","closed_at":"2018-07-17T17:38:16Z","merged_at":"2018-07-17T17:38:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"926475586bddab13e80be26fef121ed57bc327dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11670/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11670/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11670/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/4a0b57db5e9443613bc7da6ca79c2d0ddaf916b1","head":{"label":"aaronmarkham:clojure_doc_build","ref":"clojure_doc_build","sha":"4a0b57db5e9443613bc7da6ca79c2d0ddaf916b1","user":{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105819747,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU4MTk3NDc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"aaronmarkham/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Activation\r\n- [x] Convolution\r\n- [x] Deconvolution\r\n- [x] LRN \r\n- [x] Pooling \r\n- [x] Softmax\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @zheng-da

Description ##\r\nAdded a new tensor operator called diag() replicating numpy.diag().\r\n\r\nThe only difference to numpy.diag() is that for invalid k numpy diag returns an empty array while mxnet is going to LOG FATAL.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This is my first operator, please be gentle

Description ##\r\nCurrently, CachedOp is used to execute the graph in a Gluon hybrid block when the block is hybridized. It's registered as an operator, but it doesn't have a full set of operator attributes. So it can't be used as a regular operator and can't be used in a normal NNVM computation graph. This PR is to extend CachedOp and make it a normal operator. The main motivation is to use it as a default subgraph operator, as proposed in [Unified integration with external acceleration libraries](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Unified+integration+with+external+acceleration+libraries).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove

Description ##\r\nCurrently, Airbnb is developing applications that use mxnet(particularly `gluon`). We use the `mxnet.contrib.onnx` package, which supports importing to gluon from ONNX format. As this is an extremely important part of our pipeline, we want to add support to multi-gpu imports, which is currently not supported.\r\n\r\nThis is actually a very simple change, because `_load_init()` already supports, directly, a `Context` object or an iterable of them. However, the current implementation for `import_to_gluon` suggests a `str` of `'CPU'` or `'GPU'`. This is not only different from other parts of the mxnet codebase, but also does not allow us to specify which gpu's we want to load the model into. I am aware that this is to comply with ONNX, but the abstraction should be handled at the abstraction layer, not the core utility for importing ONNX to gluon.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-652], where 652 refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Modified gluon model loading from ONNX to allow multi-context argument.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Currently, mxnet uses `ctx` as an arg for a large portion of the core library. There doesn't seem to be any significant reason for why the `contrib.onnx` code uses `str` instead, rather than it being a minor oversight that passed PR's.\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-10T22:48:07Z","updated_at":"2018-07-11T06:08:22Z","closed_at":"2018-07-11T05:48:35Z","merged_at":"2018-07-11T05:48:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"f665c132c52baeeaa7d0ac3901bbb7a03e488012","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11637/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11637/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11637/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/75e382abc9e384ba63b556786507212e4a797bd6","head":{"label":"OneRaynyDay:allow-multi-gpu-load-from-onnx","ref":"allow-multi-gpu-load-from-onnx","sha":"75e382abc9e384ba63b556786507212e4a797bd6","user":{"login":"OneRaynyDay","id":7191678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTE2Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7191678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneRaynyDay","html_url":"https://github.com/OneRaynyDay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneRaynyDay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneRaynyDay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneRaynyDay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneRaynyDay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneRaynyDay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneRaynyDay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneRaynyDay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneRaynyDay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneRaynyDay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":139502632,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzk1MDI2MzI=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"OneRaynyDay/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"OneRaynyDay","id":7191678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTE2Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7191678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneRaynyDay","html_url":"https://github.com/OneRaynyDay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneRaynyDay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneRaynyDay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneRaynyDay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneRaynyDay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneRaynyDay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneRaynyDay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneRaynyDay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneRaynyDay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneRaynyDay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/OneRaynyDay/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nPreviously there were no unit tests for trainer with dist kvstore. #11429 introduced a bug for dist kvstore in trainer, where it calls `pull(ignore_sparse=False)` which is NOT implemented for dist kvstore. This PR corrects the API call and adds unit test for it. Now `ignore_sparse` is set to False for non-distributed kvstore. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nThis is to fix the flaky test: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10973. Prereq PR: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11470.\r\n`cublasSgemm` and `cublasDgemm` are currently used for linear algebra operations when cudnn is disabled for the Convolution and Deconvolution operators. The test_deconvolution test on gpu fails on the input gradients comparison for conv and deconv operators. When looking at the failures, the difference in the gradients are as big as 0.1. Replacing `cublasSgemm` with `cublasSgemmex` while keeping all other code the same, causes the failure to go away. Also, the failure doesnt happen on CPU with openblas or MKLDNN or on gpu with cudnn enabled. If both APIs work as documented, both cases should have seen the failure. My guess is that `cublasSgemm` is doing the conversion of float32 to float16 before doing the conversion, causing the precision issues. Digging through the cublas documentation, I couldn't find enough information on the computation for `cublasSgemm`.\r\nPlease see: http://lutgw1.lunet.edu/cuda/pdf/CUBLAS_Library.pdf  2.8.11 (cublassgemmex) and 2.7.1 (cublassgemm).\r\n \r\n@DickJC123 @ptrendx any inputs on if there should be any difference in behavior of two apis when all tensors have float32 dtype.\r\n\r\nThe important changes are in the file: `src/operator/linalg_impl.h`\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-10T15:44:25Z","updated_at":"2018-07-28T00:50:59Z","closed_at":"2018-07-28T00:50:59Z","merged_at":"2018-07-28T00:50:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"bd3fc88716d7312c93a2de9214c8682f19cb172b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11630/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11630/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11630/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/5cbadda482f1ac84148fd831d7a42a2963a7f854","head":{"label":"anirudh2290:fix_deconv_flaky_test_final","ref":"fix_deconv_flaky_test_final","sha":"5cbadda482f1ac84148fd831d7a42a2963a7f854","user":{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":90307467,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MDMwNzQ2Nw==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"anirudh2290/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nThis PR aims to check whether models trained on earlier versions of MXNet are loading fine on the latest version or the latest release candidate. It also aims to do a check for consistency in the inference  results on these trained models.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-651) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\nThe PRs purpose itself is to add more tests for backwards compatibility. \r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- A README.md has been added to explain the what Model Backwards Compatibility is and how it can be run.\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### TODO ###\r\n- Check the tasks using an actual Jenkins Slave. @marcoabreu Can you help me out with that ? \r\n- Backfill the S3 bucket with models trained on earlier versions of MXNet.","created_at":"2018-07-10T05:33:33Z","updated_at":"2020-09-14T18:06:09Z","closed_at":"2018-07-31T09:50:14Z","merged_at":"2018-07-31T09:50:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"a56a569e22b9241c7be59edd03b5afee0d6d42b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11626/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11626/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11626/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/ca01aa2bd9a183af10a4c3ae7ca5194c395b4ffb","head":{"label":"piyushghai:mbcc","ref":"mbcc","sha":"ca01aa2bd9a183af10a4c3ae7ca5194c395b4ffb","user":{"login":"piyushghai","id":7931019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzEwMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7931019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai","html_url":"https://github.com/piyushghai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":138212977,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzgyMTI5Nzc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"piyushghai/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"piyushghai","id":7931019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzEwMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7931019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai","html_url":"https://github.com/piyushghai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/piyushghai/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nUpdate CODEOWNERS\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-07T03:58:28Z","updated_at":"2018-07-07T21:32:16Z","closed_at":"2018-07-07T21:32:16Z","merged_at":"2018-07-07T21:32:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"c92254720184ba6dd1f084588ea0e2f8b8f41d0e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11598/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11598/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11598/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/4fad39f1116484d982c548ca35a80deb9c556269","head":{"label":"anirudh2290:update_codeowners","ref":"update_codeowners","sha":"4fad39f1116484d982c548ca35a80deb9c556269","user":{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":90307467,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MDMwNzQ2Nw==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"anirudh2290/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis is an approach for us to do integration test on Scala. As more of the examples are adding in the Scala CI, we need a separation between tests to make sure it test different things. However, this solution is not perfect due to this fact:\r\n\r\nI have placed `verify` stage on the `example` module and change the unit test to integration test. If we run the verify stage, the unit test will still be run though it takes us 1 ~ 2 minutes to finish them.\r\n\r\n@nswamy @marcoabreu @yzhliu @andrewfayres  \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-07T01:48:50Z","updated_at":"2018-07-17T21:57:37Z","closed_at":"2018-07-12T05:19:10Z","merged_at":"2018-07-12T05:19:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"b786ead562590300519a3f0725dafe7d40325edd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11596/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11596/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11596/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/cd3017a4862efcacbeb02d0e3b51c7cac7ad7c0d","head":{"label":"lanking520:integration-ci","ref":"integration-ci","sha":"cd3017a4862efcacbeb02d0e3b51c7cac7ad7c0d","user":{"login":"lanking520","id":11890922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11890922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520","html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123362138,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjMzNjIxMzg=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"lanking520/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lanking520","id":11890922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11890922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520","html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nSingle machine All Reduce Topology-aware Communication\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Proposed communication method shows speed-up compared to both existing methods (parameter server and NCCL) on small batch sizes for ResNet-50, VGG-16, Inception-v3 and AlexNet.\r\n- [x] Communication method queries the single-machine multi-GPU link topology, and determines a suitable communication pattern to use.\r\n- [x] Use feature by `MXNET_KVSTORE_USETREE=1`, default is 0.\r\n- [x] Add knobs for tuning this communication method.\r\n- [ ] In future, will add auto-tuner to automatically choose between single-machine communication protocols (parameter server, NCCL, method proposed here).\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- [Design Proposal](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Single+machine+All+Reduce+Topology-aware+Communication)\r\n- There are comments from several reviewers are here:

Description ##\r\nAdded new operators \"depth_to_space\" and \"space_to_depth\" to mxnet\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Added new operators \"depth_to_space\" and \"space_to_depth\"\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nRan Tests

Description ##\r\nBucketSentenceIter has bug  \r\nwhen there are buckets with no item.  \r\nIt keeps invalid buckets as self.buckets  \r\nbut self.data contains only valid buckets and  \r\nit leads to the mismatch with sentence length of symbol and actual data shape.  \r\nI fixed the problem by checking valid buckets and handed it to self.buckets.\r\nThis fixes issue  #11430.\r\n\r\n\r\n##

Description ##\r\nThis is to fix the flaky test https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11171\r\nThere was a race condition when we invalidate MKLDNN memory in NDArray. The original code invalidates MKLDNN memory in the memory planning phase (AsArray) as well, which is called outside the threaded engine. The static memory allocation mode of CachedOp shares the same NDArrays in different model executions. Therefore, the NDArrays may still be used in the threaded engine from the previous model execution, while the same CachedOp is executed for the next execution and the same NDArrays are used in memory planning. With MKLDNN enabled, NDArrays were modified in the memory planning phase, which leads to race condition.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-06T07:39:38Z","updated_at":"2018-09-29T21:32:10Z","closed_at":"2018-07-11T16:49:23Z","merged_at":"2018-07-11T16:49:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"b264f6f51a5a34c2884e34b7f366f68627237308","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11577/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11577/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11577/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/b09b8af859361b69db65e805ebbc3b8386cc384b","head":{"label":"zheng-da:fix_mkldnn_racecond1","ref":"fix_mkldnn_racecond1","sha":"b09b8af859361b69db65e805ebbc3b8386cc384b","user":{"login":"zheng-da","id":70481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da","html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":103710066,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDM3MTAwNjY=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"zheng-da/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zheng-da","id":70481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da","html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThe mxnet L2 norm implementation is currently prone to under/overflow when called on NDArrays with very small or large elements. This PR adds a stable L2 norm reducer and switches the dense `norm` operator to make use of it.\r\n\r\nThe implementation follows the [Blas nrm2 reference implementation](http://www.netlib.org/blas/snrm2.f).\r\n\r\nAs  a final rescaling step is necessary  at the end of the reduction, this PR also introduces a new `Finalize` method for Reducers. This method is a noop for all previous reducers. A separate PR needs to add the `Finalize` method to the maximum and minimum reducers in mshadow.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Improve numerical stability for L2 norm in `norm()` operator\r\n- [x] Improve numerical stability of sum in broadcast reduce\r\n\r\n### Comments ###\r\n- The test_norm() test was currently disabled (https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11509). It is enabled in this PR. Maybe using a different norm2 implementation will fix the flakiness of the test..\r\n- I tried avoiding the need to add the `Finalize` method to all existing reducers (i.e. maximum, minimum, sum, product, nansum, nanprod) using [SFINAE](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae) but it didn't get it to work immediately (the Finalize() would correctly be skipped if it the respective reducer didn't implement it, but for unknown reasons was also skipped if the reducer implemented it). As there are not many reducers, I added the method for now. The SFINAE approach  was as  follows:\r\n\r\n``` C++\r\ntemplate <typename Reducer, typename DType>\r\nauto reducer_finalize(DType val, DType residual, int) -> decltype(Reducer::Finalize, void()) {\r\n   Reducer::Finalize(val, residual);\r\n}\r\n\r\ntemplate <typename Reducer, typename DType>\r\nauto reducer_finalize(DType val, DType residual, long) -> decltype(void()) {}\r\n```","created_at":"2018-07-05T23:17:59Z","updated_at":"2018-07-11T17:21:42Z","closed_at":"2018-07-11T05:30:54Z","merged_at":"2018-07-11T05:30:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"43ad56c8b6c28c44daadc2ba93530f2dacdd51e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11573/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11573/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11573/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/19a8d8a04955989a60a29ca549736d9491c0b346","head":{"label":"leezu:stablenrm2","ref":"stablenrm2","sha":"19a8d8a04955989a60a29ca549736d9491c0b346","user":{"login":"leezu","id":946903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu","html_url":"https://github.com/leezu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":82283296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MjI4MzI5Ng==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"leezu/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"leezu","id":946903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu","html_url":"https://github.com/leezu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/leezu/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-05T22:53:05Z","updated_at":"2018-07-11T20:29:03Z","closed_at":"2018-07-05T22:57:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6432e10cbd4a73212e0c77bf149c12cd1b8cafbe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11570/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11570/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11570/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/825708e1db494669214682509ba11100cb606562","head":{"label":"lanking520:example-rnn","ref":"example-rnn","sha":"825708e1db494669214682509ba11100cb606562","user":{"login":"lanking520","id":11890922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11890922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520","html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123362138,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjMzNjIxMzg=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"lanking520/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lanking520","id":11890922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11890922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520","html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the proposal of adding a set of control flow operators to MXNet. [Link](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Optimize+dynamic+neural+network+models+with+control+flow+operators) to proposal.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Add while_loop operator in `src/operator/control_flow.cc`\r\n\r\n## TODO ##\r\n- [x] Add a JIRA_ID\r\n- [x] Add more testcases\r\n- [x] Re-examine all `TODO(Junru)` in changes","created_at":"2018-07-05T18:39:25Z","updated_at":"2018-07-27T01:14:27Z","closed_at":"2018-07-19T00:09:10Z","merged_at":"2018-07-19T00:09:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"54632bcb38064a0ed1f23dd652897562d3a0036a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11566/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11566/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11566/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/bd48b7781ee2ca9ccd7b8fb0674e45e2011332e5","head":{"label":"junrushao:while_loop_pr","ref":"while_loop_pr","sha":"bd48b7781ee2ca9ccd7b8fb0674e45e2011332e5","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":139630847,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzk2MzA4NDc=","name":"mxnet","full_name":"junrushao/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis PR contains examples written from the new API.\r\n@nswamy @yzhliu @andrewfayres\r\nAll examples pushed here are tested locally on my Mac. It lives in the new package called `org.apache.mxnetexamples`\r\n\r\nBe aware: GAN MNIST Example is specifically designed to run on GPU. Disable the CPU\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nSometimes datasets may be hosted on servers that serve invalid SSL certificates. If so, this allow disabling the SSL certificate verification. The default behavior is not changed.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Add verify_ssl option to

Description ##\r\nConstructing a weird `CachedOp` directly in C++, in rare cases might lead to rebuilding `full_graph` in `CachedOp` without updating `bwd_ograd_dep_`. This potentially causes crash when `OpReqType` of one of `outputs` of `grad_graph_` is `OpReqType::kNullOp`. This PR enhances the capability of `CachedOp` to handle this case.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Manually check node existence in CachedOp\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This change is fully backward

Description ##\r\nFix issue #8044 \r\n\r\ntracked at: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-620\r\n\r\n**Solution:**\r\nBump up atol value from 1e-4 to 1e-2\r\n\r\nThe following 3 tests related to batchnorm training can all pass  10000 runs:\r\n```\r\ntests/python/unittest/test_operator.py:test_batchnorm_training\r\ntests/python/gpu/test_operator_gpu.py:test_batchnorm_training\r\ntests/python/mkl/test_mkldnn.py:test_batchnorm\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Finding 1:**\r\nUsing fp32 with atol=1e-2 or fp64 with atol=1e-3 both works, chose the former one.\r\nTried different numeric_eps=1e-3, didn't work for all cases\r\n\r\n**Finding 2:**\r\nReason of failing due to batchnorm result slightly different than result calculated by numeric gradient. Current implementation of batchnorm should be correct.\r\n\r\n**Finding 3:**\r\nVerified  the gradient of 3 different batchnorm implementation are close but they are all different than numeric gradient. (CPU, GPU without cuDNN, GPU with cuDNN)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**\r\n1. Current batchnorm implementation is correct and result is consistent across all implementations (mkldnn, w/ cudnn, w/o cuddn)\r\n2. The batchnorm gradient is slightly different than numeric gradient calculated using finite differential method. Difference is less than rtol=0.16. atol=1e-2, it's large comparing to other operators, but acceptable in this case due to large precision loss in batchnorm.\r\n3. Enable this test with larger atol is better than just disable it. (it could caught #11448 if enabled), it serves more like a sanity check to prevent the gradient results are far too off from numeric calculations.\r\n4. Batchnorm errors can also be caught in test_batchnorm_with_type where consistency between each implementation is compared. \r\n\r\nSee comments in #8044 for detailed results.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist

Description ##\r\n From feedback from the Clojure package PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11205, this changes the automatic generation of the ndarray and symbol code from a manual step to an automatic compile-time (AOT) step. The generated code is no longer checked into git as well.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Move ndarray and symbol code generation to compile time\r\n- Remove generated code files from git\r\n- Remove the alias to generate-code from the project file since it is now automatic\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nTo test this change:\r\n\r\n### with lein test\r\n1) Make sure there are no files in the `src/org/apache/clojure_mxnet/gen` directory\r\n2) Run `lein test`\r\n3) Tests should run fine and the generated files should be present in `src/org/apache/clojure_mxnet/gen` but ignored by git\r\n\r\n## with jars\r\n1) Make sure there are no files in the `src/org/apache/clojure_mxnet/gen` directory\r\n2) Run `lein install` to create target jar\r\n3) cd `examples/imclassification`\r\n4) run `lein run` to run the example with the installed jar\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-02T22:51:08Z","updated_at":"2018-07-03T02:30:50Z","closed_at":"2018-07-03T02:30:50Z","merged_at":"2018-07-03T02:30:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"e94146f2ef2a803433aa8e0e3bcb1b59a12630dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11534/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11534/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11534/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/eb4ba9da2cd0358bd01b59a5697710b1d4cce0be","head":{"label":"gigasquid:automatic-code-generation","ref":"automatic-code-generation","sha":"eb4ba9da2cd0358bd01b59a5697710b1d4cce0be","user":{"login":"gigasquid","id":340299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDI5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid","html_url":"https://github.com/gigasquid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":113923015,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTM5MjMwMTU=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"gigasquid/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gigasquid","id":340299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDI5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid","html_url":"https://github.com/gigasquid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gigasquid/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis PR is a copy of https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/10451.\r\n\r\nThis PR reconstructs MXNet IR system to support control flow operators and adds one control flow operator: foreach. It takes a Python function as input and run the function over the elements in the input array. foreach is similar to scan in TensorFlow.\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the proposal of adding a set of control flow operators to MXNet.\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Optimize+dynamic+neural+network+models+with+control+flow+operators\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change","created_at":"2018-07-02T18:44:30Z","updated_at":"2020-05-05T01:59:37Z","closed_at":"2018-07-02T22:26:52Z","merged_at":"2018-07-02T22:26:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"030fbc3c7baec4a0f0cce78a45aa1da00eea0b48","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11531/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11531/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11531/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/392a7e4c1f03ab3ba91196191fe18b21b5891f36","head":{"label":"zheng-da:foreach1","ref":"foreach1","sha":"392a7e4c1f03ab3ba91196191fe18b21b5891f36","user":{"login":"zheng-da","id":70481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da","html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":103710066,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDM3MTAwNjY=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"zheng-da/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zheng-da","id":70481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da","html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/use

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-02T18:09:43Z","updated_at":"2018-07-02T20:53:38Z","closed_at":"2018-07-02T20:53:33Z","merged_at":"2018-07-02T20:53:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"490e9517ce882c1ccbbd4f7ea24a2e3bf79b4eb5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11529/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11529/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11529/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/40e04ef75db539f450141464a26ce0b82d751ded","head":{"label":"apache:piiswrong-patch-2","ref":"piiswrong-patch-2","sha":"40e04ef75db539f450141464a26ce0b82d751ded","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11516\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- So far, GCC and G++ are properly handled by CCache and we have proper cache hits. The problem here is that NVCC still produces cache misses.\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-02T01:33:28Z","updated_at":"2018-11-29T17:21:57Z","closed_at":"2018-11-29T17:21:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f4ec95e045b846dc0d0f38b6f7f5d4eec76a7824","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707583550,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1ODM1NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Build","name":"Build","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NzQ4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-testing","name":"pr-awaiting-testing","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"PR

coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\n\r\nThere hasn't been an update on installation instructions for Ubuntu in a while. Many new packages are out and not referenced, so I'm trying to fix that.\r\n\r\n- Fixed a lot of old info in the Ubuntu instructions.\r\n- Added a table of different pip packages and what versions they support.\r\n- Added recommended installations.\r\n- Added scripts for quick installation.\r\n- Reorganized sections for clarity.\r\n- Untangled some R instructions - these were sort of inter-mingled with the standard instructions.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- I didn't mark mkl as experimental. LMK if I should change that.\r\n- I made an assumption that I don't want to show CUDA 9.1 packages... since NVIDIA isn't even offering it...\r\n- I assume that CUDA 9.2 and cuDNN 7.1.4 is what is desired.\r\n- I assume that `pip install mxnet-cu92mkl` is recommended for inference.\r\n- I assume that `pip install mxnet-cu92` is recommended for training.\r\n- Once any comments settle down on this PR, I can apply these kind of changes on macOS.\r\n- I didn't try to vet the standard install instructions; this section might need updating, and I would like to see it simplified.","created_at":"2018-06-30T00:13:39Z","updated_at":"2018-07-03T13:53:41Z","closed_at":"2018-07-03T13:53:41Z","merged_at":"2018-07-03T13:53:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"552c7152513c7ddda03f6350c1ae8505a65136d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11503/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11503/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11503/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/a971d1eb2c7662d7830259f8be4f9fe41df5e2f1","head":{"label":"aaronmarkham:ubuntu_install","ref":"ubuntu_install","sha":"a971d1eb2c7662d7830259f8be4f9fe41df5e2f1","user":{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105819747,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU4MTk3NDc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"aaronmarkham/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nPrevious int64 data type for CSVIter PR was merged but forgot a special test for it.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Unit test for int64 data type support for CSVIter\r\n\r\n## Comments
