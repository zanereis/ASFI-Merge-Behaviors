Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the following situation:\r\nAs an operator one wants to be able to start a VM while another volume migration job is being already executed (when both actions are executed by same host). On vmware this is only possible when the setting `vmware.create.full.clone` is set to false, due to historic limitations in vmware. As a backwards compatible solution this PR adds a setting to override the behaviour when ` vmware.create.full.clone` is set to true. when the new setting `vmware.allow.parallel.command.execution` is set to true parallel execution of storage commands is allways allowed.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document -->\r\nunit test added and tested manually;\r\nIn an environment with 1 host and 2 primary storages\r\n\r\n1. using the settings `vmware.create.full.clone` on individual primary storages, with the setting `vmware.allow.parallel.command.execution` set to false.

Description\r\n\r\nThe API `listApis` currently has too many redundant calls to the DB, which causes slowness on the ACS login. This PR aims to improve the time of login on ACS by refactoring the classes that implement the `APIChecker` interface. In my local lab, the login usually took 13 seconds, without login cache. With this new version, the login took around 2 seconds, with no login cache as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes: #5266\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [x] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI created multiple accounts with the roles based on the following table.

Description\r\n\r\nWhile trying to update a disk offering through the UI, the tag fields are always sent, even when they are not changed. This causes a bug when active volumes are using a disk offering in storage pools with tags. As ACS would interpret this as an update on the tags as well. This PR aims to fix this problem, only sending the tags if they are different from the current tags, allowing the user to update the name and/or description of disk offerings, as it is already allowed through CloudMonkey.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that

with the following use cases:\r\n- updating only the name\r\n- updating only the description\r\n- updating only the name and description fields\r\n\r\nAll of the tests worked as expected, the UI only sent the the fields that were changed.\r\n\r\nThen, while trying to update the name and/or description fields, and changing the tags as well, the API was sending the tags parameters, as expected.","created_at":"2022-05-24T15:15:54Z","updated_at":"2022-06-27T11:24:38Z","closed_at":"2022-06-27T11:24:38Z","merged_at":"2022-06-27T11:24:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"e1fb2be835fc2e9da877c89a5414ecca6b260db3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":739374767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzkzNzQ3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:UI","name":"component:UI","color":"ea62a8","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/23/labels","id":7233557,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AbmAV","number":23,"title":"4.18.0.0","description":"released","creator":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":323,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-08T08:55:48Z","updated_at":"2024-06-10T07:59:31Z","due_on":"2023-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2023-03-15T18:50:04Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/6410/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/6410/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/6410/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/ceac6c52a3f2e682a138f725168c1be34e35c3f5","head":{"label":"scclouds:update-name-description-disk-offering","ref":"update-name-description-disk-offering","sha":"ceac6c52a3f2e682a138f725168c1be34e35c3f5","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds/cloudstack","description":"Apache

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, ACS does not validate host tags on running VMs that have their computing resources increased via Scale VM command. Therefore, if a service offering with host tags deploys on a host with the same host tags, it is permitted to live scale this VM to another service offering with another host tags. This PR aims to fix this bug, verifying the host tags on a VM live scaling.\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThis was tested in a local lab with the following scenario:\r\n\r\n1.

Description\r\n\r\nPR #5984 recently implemented the `listVirtualMachinesUsageHistory` API, which provides historical data of VM stats. However, the current ACS UI only shows VM stats from the most recent data collection.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements new features in the UI which allow ACS users to view the historical stats of each VM individually.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n###

the VMWare hypervisor, when trying to create IOPS-limited VMs, either using Compute or Disk offerings, the IOPS limits were not respected in the hypervisor. This behavior has been corrected, in order to be able to limit, in VMWare, the IOPS limit of a VM, as long as the option to limit IOPS via hypervisor is used.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue we found in the smoke test `test/integration/smoke/test_network_ipv6.py`.\r\nsometimes the test failed with error below\r\n```\r\nFAIL: Test to verify IPv6

unsuccessful\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter investigation, we found the egress traffic is dropped by `nft`.\r\n\r\na correct nft chain looks like\r\n```\r\nroot@r-282-VM:~# nft list chain ip6 ip6_firewall fw_chain_egress\r\ntable ip6 ip6_firewall {\r\n\tchain fw_chain_egress {\r\n\t\tcounter packets 0 bytes 0 accept\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, some VRs have the following nft chain\r\n```\r\nroot@r-280-VM:~# nft list chain ip6 ip6_firewall fw_chain_egress\r\ntable ip6 ip6_firewall {\r\n\tchain fw_chain_egress {\r\n\t\tcounter packets 0 bytes 0 drop\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is because the ingress rule does not have correct `default_egress_policy`\r\n```\r\nroot@r-280-VM:~# cat /etc/cloudstack/ipv6firewallrules.json\r\n{\r\n  \"0\": {\r\n    \"already_added\": false,\r\n    \"default_egress_policy\": true,\r\n    \"dest_cidr_list\": [],\r\n    \"guest_ip6_cidr\": \"fd17:ac56:1234:1a96::/64\",\r\n    \"id\": 0,\r\n    \"protocol\":

\"already_added\": false,\r\n    \"default_egress_policy\": false,\r\n    \"dest_cidr_list\": [\r\n      \"::/0\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"guest_ip6_cidr\": \"fd17:ac56:1234:1a96::/64\",\r\n

 \"::/0\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"traffic_type\": \"Ingress\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"id\": \"ipv6firewallrules\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nin mose time, the Egress rule is processed before Ingress rule.\r\nBut when the Ingress rule is processed at first, the nft chain will be wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features,

Description\r\n\r\nWhen one is using API  [listServiceOfferings](https://cloudstack.apache.org/api/apidocs-4.16/apis/listServiceOfferings.html) passing the parameter `virtualmachineid` (like when scaling up a VM via UI), only the available offerings for the VM are listed. If the current VM's offering has host tags, only offerings with compatible host tags are listed. Offerings that do not have host tags can be used in any host; therefore, independent of the host tags of the current VM's offering, they also should be available for the VM.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to change  API listServiceOfferings to also list offerings without host tags when filtering the VM.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIt was tested in a local lab.\r\n\r\nI created 3 compute offerings:\r\n1.

Description\r\n\r\nUsing KVM hypervisor, the free memory stats of the user VMs that are returned by ACS do not correspond to those observed directly in the VMs (when using the `free -m` command, for example).\r\n\r\nIt was identified that the problem was in the memory stats collection process performed by Libvirt. This happens because the period that Libvirt would get memory stats updates for each VM was never set. Thus, even if ACS periodically requested the stats for the hosts, the data obtained were always the same.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves the mentioned problem. A new Agent configuration parameter called `vm.memballoon.stats.period` was created. This parameter allows operatos to set the time interval in which Libvirt will get memory stats updates. The default value of this parameter is 60 seconds, the same default value as the `vm.stats.interval` parameter. However, in a cloud containing multiple Management Servers, operators can set the value of `vm.memballoon.stats.period` lower than the `vm.stats.interval`, so that each Management Server always gets updated memory stats for all user VMs (since each Management Server can request stats at different instants).\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIn a local lab, I tested multiple combinations for all the related Agent properties (`vm.memballoon.stats.period`, `vm.stats.interval`, and `vm.memballoon.disable`). In all cases tested, the memory stats of the user VMs were obtained properly.\r\nAlso, I added unit

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, the listLoadBalancerRuleInstances API has no logs, which makes troubleshooting harder.\r\nThis PR aims to add several logs with context on the processing performed by this API. This will allow cloud operators to better analyze possible errors or inconsistencies that may occur when using the API.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently when ACS fails to load the beans for some component, such as cloud-usage, an exception will be thrown but it is not logged, making the system restart indefinitely. Without any logs, it can be hard to figure out what is happening; to fix that, a try-catch block and a new log were added in the bootstrap of the agent.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes

Description\r\n\r\nThe classes AgentProperties and AgentPropertiesFileHandler were previously created to map the existing properties of the agent.properties file to facilitate their use; however, only a few properties were mapped at the time.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to build on those changes. All of the properties of the agent.properties file were mapped in the AgentProperties class.\r\nWhile executing the mapping, I found some properties that were used in the code, but were not documented in the \"agent.properties\" file. These properties were also documented, and registered accordingly in the properties file.\r\n\r\nThe way the properties were accessed in the code was changed, and now the values are obtained through the AgentPropertiesFileHandler class. Also, Unit Tests were added and modified according to necessity. \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThis was manually tested in a local lab, by altering properties and performing main actions: creating and deleting VMs, creating new Volumes and snapshots, etc.\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-02T19:29:47Z","updated_at":"2022-12-22T11:00:50Z","closed_at":"2022-12-22T11:00:50Z","merged_at":"2022-12-22T11:00:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"0fe2e6950e9f94b0099cbb8d1e7f3c245b96f9c9","assignee":{"login":"GutoVeronezi","id":38945620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTQ1NjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38945620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi","html_url":"https://github.com/GutoVeronezi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"GutoVeronezi","id":38945620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTQ1NjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38945620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi","html_url":"https://github.com/GutoVeronezi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584072971,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzI5NzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:kvm","name":"component:kvm","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073391,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMzOTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:virtual-router","name":"component:virtual-router","color":"ffaaeb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":592559219,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTI1NTkyMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:networking","name":"component:networking","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1092869943,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDkyODY5OTQz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:agent","name":"component:agent","color":"80e5e2","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/23/labels","id":7233557,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AbmAV","number":23,"title":"4.18.0.0","description":"released","creator":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":323,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-08T08:55:48Z","updated_at":"2024-06-10T07:59:31Z","due_on":"2023-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2023-03-15T18:50:04Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/6348/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/6348/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/6348/comments","statuses

Description\r\n\r\nRelease 4.16.0.0 introduced a feature for migrating system VM volumes (#4385). However, it was enabled only for VMWare.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to enable the feature for KVM too.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIt was tested in a local lab.\r\n\r\n(I tested the process for each system VM type)\r\n\r\nTo test the SSVM and CPVM, I enabled a zone to create them. When they were created, I disabled the zone. I accessed the system VMs and created files to validate later. I stopped them and migrated the volumes. I checked the references in database and storage and then I started the system VMs. After that, I accessed them again and verified the files. The migration performed successfully, the data was kept and the system VMs were working fine.\r\n\r\nTo test the VR, I created a network. I accessed the VR and created a file to validate later. I stopped the VR and migrated the volume. I checked the reference in database and storage and then I started the VR. After that, I accessed it again and verified the file. The migration performed successfully, the data was kept and the VR was working fine.","created_at":"2022-04-29T22:49:29Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T04:33:04Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T04:33:04Z","merged_at":"2022-08-09T04:33:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"b0e780a35eb226c07f0006f4c051a7fd46c8e430","assignee":{"login":"shwstppr","id":153340,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzM0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr","html_url":"https://github.com/shwstppr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"shwstppr","id":153340,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzM0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr","html_url":"https://github.com/shwstppr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073853,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:api","name":"component:api","color":"1DB401","default":false,"description":""},{"id":592559219,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTI1NTkyMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:networking","name":"component:networking","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":739374767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzkzNzQ3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:UI","name":"component:UI","color":"ea62a8","default":false,"description":""},{"id":904051781,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MDQwNTE3ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"a9b50e","default":false,"description":"Warning...

I created a new VM;\r\n2. I migrated this VM, with its volumes, to another host;\r\n3. I readed the logs to see if they were improved.\r\n4.

href=\"https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/esapi4java-core-2.3.0.0-release-notes.txt\">https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/esapi4java-core-2.3.0.0-release-notes.txt</a></p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Because this release of ESAPI fixes several vulnerabilities, it is <em>extremely important</em> that you actually read the release notes. Failure to do so likely will cause previous ESAPI users to miss some critical remediation steps!</p>\n<p>Finally, note  that the file &quot;<strong>esapi-2.3.0.0-configuration.jar</strong>&quot; (see below) contains the default ESAPI configuration files under 'configuration/' (ESAPI.properties, validation.properties, etc.) and the file &quot;esapi-2.3.0.0-configuration.jar.asc&quot; is a GPG signature of that jar file made by 'Kevin W. Wall (GitHub signing key) <a href=\"mailto:kevin.w.wall@gmail.com\">kevin.w.wall@gmail.com</a>'.</p>\n<h2>2.2.3.1</h2>\n<p>Release notes for ESAPI release 2.x.y.z are located at:\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/esapi4java-core-2.2.3.1-release-notes.txt\">https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/esapi4java-core-2.2.3.1-release-notes.txt</a>\nThis was a very minor point release.</p>\n<p>Note the file &quot;esapi-2.2.3.1-configuration.jar&quot; contains the default ESAPI configuration files under 'configuration/' (ESAPI.properties, validation.properties, etc.) and the file &quot;esapi-2.2.3.1-configuration.jar.asc&quot; is a GPG signature of that jar file made by Kevin W.

Main update are:\n-- AntiSamy, from 1.5.11 to 1.6.2.\n-- As a result of the AntiSamy upgrade, the transitive dependency xercesImpl was updated from 2.12.0 to 2.12.1 which should address CVE-2020-14338.\n-- Apache batik-css, updated from 1.13 to 1.14.</p>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/master/documentation/esapi4java-core-2.2.3.0-release-notes.txt\">ESAPI 2.2.3.0 release notes</a> for details.</p>\n<p>Note the configuration jar and its detached signature are also attached.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on PR #6281, it aims to clean the UI label files by removing all labels that are no longer being used. There are more than three thousand labels on en.json; therefore, I used some scripts to help me with that. The following steps were used to determine which labels where unused:\r\n\r\n1. The first script took each key from the English json and searched for that snippet in all the JS, VUE and HTML files in the UI folder, saving in another file all the keys that were used.\r\n2. The second script took all the keys in en.json that weren't in the first script's output and saved them to another file. Which therefore contained all the keys that were not being used according to the first script.\r\n3. The third script was made to ensure that all the keys discovered in the second script were not really being used, for that purpose it took each of the keys discovered in the second script and called `grep -r -l -i '<key>'`, saving in another file all the results found.\r\n4. The fourth step was manual, I looked at the fourth script output file searching for keys that had some grep result (there were some). I mean, looking for keys that were being generated in runtime via string concatenation.\r\n5. The fifth step was to create a last script to remove from the original json all keys that were verified that were not really being used and delete them.\r\n6. I tested it, trying to navigate through all the parts of the UI to verify that everything was OK, I found two places that used labels implicitly and re-added them into the json.\r\n7. Finally, after validating that all the used labels were there, I made a final simple script to remove any keys from the other languages' json that weren't in the updated English file.\r\n\r\nPs: the `el_GR.json` file wasn't properly formatted (it had a space between every key and its ':'), so when it was loaded/dumped it was reformatted into right format. That's why it shows that every line in it was changed. \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature

Description\r\n\r\nUsing the VMWare hypervisor with Veeam integration enabled, ACS uses a hard-coded timeout of 600 seconds (10 minutes) to monitor restore process status in Veeam. If the restore does not finish in this time, ACS throws an exception; however, the restore process continues in Veeam. This PR aims to externalize a global configuration to allow operators to define the timeout value in Veeam restore backups process. Thus, making it adaptable to different needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt was tested in a local lab:\r\n\r\n1. I created a new huge VM and attached this VM to a Backup Offering;\r\n2. I performed a manual backup;\r\n3. I tried to restore this VM using the backup;\r\n4.
