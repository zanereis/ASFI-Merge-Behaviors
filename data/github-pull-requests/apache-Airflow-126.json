as https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/21157\r\n\r\nTaskListener API's contract promises to pass TaskInstance object to listener plugin. However, what happens is not 100% true - the object being passed is one that maps to current SQLAlchemy session.\r\n\r\n`_run_raw_task` before merging the TI operates on detached TaskInstance object, then merges it to current session. Since there is no attached object in the SQLAlchemy identity map, SQLAlchemy creates it, and it's this object that's being passed to the SQLAlchemy event listeners.\r\n\r\nThe problem with that is that when creating new SQLAlchemy object, SQLAlchemy takes care about setting only database-mapped fields. The ones that are purely on the python side, like task aren't being set on the new object.\r\n\r\nThis PR manually sets `task` on the new SQLAlchemy object, so that `on_task_instance_success` and `on_task_instance_failed` receives proper TaskInstance with task field set.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

on #27027.~~ Merged; rebased to main.\r\n\r\nThis involves a few things:\r\n\r\n* The mapped task group needs to implement parse-time and run-time ti count accessors, similar to the mapped operator.\r\n* Since a non-mapped operator can be in a mapped task group and thus needs to be expanded, the parse-time and run-time ti count accessors are \"raised\" from MappedOperator to AbstractOperator (so they can be used by BaseOperator). These now also considers an operator's parent task groups.\r\n* If a ti count accessor is called on a non-mapped operator that's not in any mapped task group, the accessor should return a special value of a sort. Since None is already used, we raise an exception in this case instead (simply called NotMapped). For consistency, the previous case where None was returned (upstreams not available) is also changed to raise an exception instead (reusing NotFullyPopulated). This means the ti count accessors now always return an int, and raise an exception whenever the count is not available.\r\n* All of the above result in a coherant interface in AbstractOperator that can be used in DagRun to perform ti count revision.","created_at":"2022-10-20T09:05:32Z","updated_at":"2022-11-21T16:23:34Z","closed_at":"2022-11-10T08:17:18Z","merged_at":"2022-11-10T08:17:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"a16aa730686c99916f5bc5550ed52259499b2468","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769805151,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5ODA1MTUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:serialization","name":"area:serialization","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2172800071,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwMDcx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:new-feature","name":"type:new-feature","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

One of the challenges of running Celery workers in containerized environment is detecting system termination of a raw task instance. \r\nFor example, if running task hits Airflow celery worker container memory limit and terminated by OOM killer, the only way for a DAG author to discover that task failed because of the memory pressure - is to guess it from the log entry \"Task exited with return code negsignal.SIGKILL\". \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2447492/196821258-e320070a-bca9-40c4-bfe3-b1f82abe7983.png)\r\n\r\nThis message is a bit cryptic and from the point of the engineer responsible for Airflow infrastructure management (who is often a different person from the DAG authors) it would be much nicer to setup the dashboard that could display such events and setup alerts for them. Of course, it is possible to parse the log entries of all tasks, but this is a fragile invariant which would require additional tooling.\r\n\r\n**Proposed solution:**  Introduce a metric for task instances raw task execution return codes. The proposed structure is a counter with the name: `ti.raw_task_return_code.<dag-id>.<task-id>.<return code>`. This will allow to both detect the changes in the frequency of particular return codes (like SIGKILL or SIGTERM) across the whole Airflow deployment and to scope down failures to particular tasks.\r\n\r\n*TODO:* Update documentation - I expect to have some discussion around the idea of this metric in this PR, so I want to have a consensus on the name/implementation before putting it in the docs.

DAG name falls back to `dag_id` if `display_name` is not specified by the user.\r\n- Directly using non-ascii characters in `dag_id` breaks couples of functionalities (see issues:

Airflow 2.3 Connection could be represented as JSON object which perfectly work without any changes in `SystemsManagerParameterStoreBackend.get_conn_value`\r\n\r\n- Add appropriate info in AWS SSM Parameter Store Secrets Backend doc\r\n- Add tests that it actually works with SSM Parameter Store SB (also helps if something changed in the future)\r\n- Add changes in deprecated method `SystemsManagerParameterStoreBackend.get_conn_uri` so it return always URI even if it stored as JSON objects. I do not know but might be better just remove this method since it should not use internally in Airflow since 2.3 however it might use in some user

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/27080\r\n\r\nBefore this [PR](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/23711) which added the standalone Dag Processors to the helm chart, the git sync logic was:\r\n- if `dags.gitSync.enabled` then:\r\n  1. add `git_sync_container-init` and  `git_sync_container` to scheduler pods containers\r\n  2. load the volume `dags` from:\r\n     -  a PVC if `dags.persistence.enabled`: claim existing PVC if `dags.persistence.existingClaim` is defined or create a new PVC if not\r\n     -  `emptyDir` volume if not\r\n  4. mount the volume `dags` to scheduler container as readOnly\r\n  5. mount the volume `dags` to `git_sync_container`\r\n- elif `dags.persistence.enabled` then:\r\n  -  load the volume `dags` from an existing PVC if `dags.persistence.existingClaim` is defined or create a new PVC if not\r\n  - add this volume to schedulers container\r\n \r\nSo when `dags.gitSync.enabled` we always had a `git_sync_container` running in the schedulers pods, and the `dags.persistence.enabled` is used to specify the volume type\r\n\r\nAfter the PR, we create the `git_sync_container` in the scheduler pods only if:\r\n- executor is one of the Local Executors and `gitSync` is enabled\r\n- or `dagProcessor` is not enabled and `gitSync` is enabled\r\n\r\nwhich I find logical ([code](https://github.com/gmsantos/airflow/blob/main/chart/templates/scheduler/scheduler-deployment.yaml#L221-L223))\r\n\r\nBut we create the `git_sync_container` in the `dag-processor` only if `gitSync` is enabled and `dags.persistence` is not enabled ([code](https://github.com/gmsantos/airflow/blob/main/chart/templates/dag-processor/dag-processor-deployment.yaml#L189-L191))\r\n\r\nI think we can always create `git_sync_container` in the `dag-processor` pod when it is enabled and `gitSync` is enabled, and we use `dags.persistence` to switch between PVC and emptyDir","created_at":"2022-10-18T22:14:12Z","updated_at":"2023-03-02T00:13:36Z","closed_at":"2023-03-02T00:13:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bec39d338b9bfa2e08f5a1fec36d12bcac4175b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

PR expands `listeners` API to be notified about DagRun state changes.\r\n\r\nPR https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/20443 introduced `Listener API` to Airflow, enabling users and developers to write `Pluggy` plugins. Here the same mechanism is used to provide notifications about `DagRun` states - whether `DagRun` started, succeeded or failed. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR adds lifecycle methods for plugins - when Airflow `Job` - whether `SchedulerJob`, `BackfillJob` or `LocalTaskJob` runs, it notifies plugin that it starts or finishes. \r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Maciej Obuchowski

Following which, the groups created for task_id and map_index are compared and the grouping that results in a smaller number of groups will be used.\r\n\r\nThis means that a sql query that would look like\r\n`\r\nSELECT ...\r\nFROM ...\r\nWHERE (task_instance.dag_id, task_instance.task_id, task_instance.run_id, task_instance.map_index) IN ((...), 20,000+ more tuples...)\r\n` \r\nwould instead look like this:\r\n`\r\nSELECT ...\r\nFROM ...\r\nWHERE (task_instance.dag_id = <dag_id1> AND task_instance.run_id = <run_id1> AND task_instance.map_index = <map_index1> AND task_instance.task_id IN (task_id1, ...) \r\nOR (task_instance.dag_id = <dag_id1> AND task_instance.run_id = <run_id2> AND task_instance.map_index = <map_index1> AND task_instance.task_id IN (task_id1, ...)\r\nOR (...)\r\n... \r\n`\r\n\r\nthis significantly improves the query time, such that clearing a dag with downstream and recursive set and running over 20,000+ task instances is much faster.\r\n\r\nto test this in breeze:\r\n`\r\n pytest tests/sensors/test_external_task_sensor.py -k test_clear_overlapping_external_task_marker\r\n`\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull

I was using the Trino provider package of airflow. While using I found out that I am not able to set `session_properties` for the Trino connector.  So I am creating this PR to fix this. This way if the user needs to add session_properties from Airflow UI they can add it like below\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"catalog\": \"hive\", \"protocol\": \"https\", \"session_properties\": \"{'hive.insert_existing_partitions_behavior':'OVERWRITE', 'scale_writers':'true','task_writer_count':'1','writer_min_size':'32MB'}\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14219201/142755452-28c0a44b-ac7c-4059-adff-453d35b4d5e9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nLet

PR adds a trigger UI based on ideas and discussion from [AIP-50 Trigger DAG UI Extension with Flexible User Form Concept](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-50+Trigger+DAG+UI+Extension+with+Flexible+User+Form+Concept) based on current FAB UI infrastructure. (Note: Initially it was a PoC PR, now functionally complete).\r\n\r\nDue to the feedback received on [AIP-50](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-50+Trigger+DAG+UI+Extension+with+Flexible+User+Form+Concept) the PR is based on the [`Params` toolings](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/params.html) already available and leverages with minimal changes 80% of desired scope. Also the parallel implementation of https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/27805 was integrated.\r\n\r\nCoverage/Scope of this PR:\r\n- AIP-50 Part 1+3 (fully covered): Specifying Trigger UI on DAG Level + Standard Implementation for Forms\r\n    - By defining `params` or usage of existing `params` dict a form as UI is generated dynamically\r\n    - Existing JSON schema is used as good as possible with slight extensions for purpose of form rendering\r\n    - Compared to the initial idea to have a \"new\" form as dialog, the proposed PR now extends the existing JSON entry UI by:\r\n        - If `params` are defined on a DAG a form is generated\r\n        - If no `params` are defined the previous JSON based entry is presented\r\n        - Why? Benefits? Part 2 was implemented slightly different than proposed in AIP-50 - see below.\r\n    - Small derivations compared to current AIP-50:\r\n        - Field type and rendering of field is not only made depending on Schema but also auto-discovered for common data types (string, number, list, object, boolean) which adds an easy entry for existing DAGs w/o needs of change == for free.\r\n        - Field type `hidden` was implemented by using the JSON schema attribute `constant` which assumes that only one constant value is permitted, no additional flag needed.\r\n        - Advanced section of a entry form was generalized allowing to define any/multiple sections of the form (not limited to one \"Advanced\")\r\n- AIP-50 Part 2: not included, will be a future PR.\r\n- AIP-50 Part 4 (fully covered): Examples:\r\n    - Two examples added within this PR\r\n        - One simple example as \"showcase\"\r\n        - One \"Tutorial\" with a lot of examples for large coverage and template for users to be able to copy\r\n- AIP-50 Part 5 (fully covered): Documentation\r\n    - Extended the existing page [Params](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/params.html) to add details about UI, options and supported parameters etc.\r\n\r\nrelated: #26215 #27805\r\ncloses: #11054 \r\n\r\nFYI @clellmann @wolfdn @AutomationDev85","created_at":"2022-10-14T18:33:01Z","updated_at":"2023-10-28T08:23:43Z","closed_at":"2023-01-30T16:23:58Z","merged_at":"2023-01-30T16:23:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"5e470c1fc422a05815a595cdf2544ebc586405cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2057471696,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDU3NDcxNjk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/changelog:skip","name":"changelog:skip","color":"a8f731","default":false,"description":"Changes that should be skipped from the changelog (CI, tests, etc..)"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

all, this is my first PR to Airflow, so bear with me in case I've missing something :)\r\n\r\nI'd like to update the `TriggerDagRunOperator` to add support for TaskFlow and allow reading the conf from the xcom directly, without having to encapsulate it in a wrapper function.\r\nAt the moment, in fact, the TriggerDagRunOperator performs the `conf` param type-validaton in the init, and this fails if we try to pass an xcom object directly with Taskflow as the xcom is deserialized only after the validation. The only solution to use it at the moment is to encapsulate it in a function, and manually run it:\r\n```python\r\n@dag\r\ndef taskflow_dag(**kwargs):\r\n    @task\r\n    def foo():\r\n        return {\"foo\":\"bar\"}\r\n\r\n    @task\r\n    def trigger_wrapper(myconfig):\r\n        TriggerDagRunOperator(..., conf=myconfig).execute(kwargs)\r\n\r\n    myconfig = foo()\r\n    trigger_wrapper(myconfig)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhile I would like to be able to do:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@dag\r\ndef taskflow_dag(**kwargs):\r\n    @task\r\n    def foo():\r\n        return {\"foo\":\"bar\"}\r\n\r\n    myconfig = foo()\r\n    TriggerDagRunOperator(..., conf=myconfig) # this fails now because myconfig is deserialized after the init\r\n```","created_at":"2022-10-13T15:03:28Z","updated_at":"2022-11-09T19:56:40Z","closed_at":"2022-11-06T17:07:26Z","merged_at":"2022-11-06T17:07:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"2462d57eccd8353b9a9d32a91d75c027e137fd7c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

So, I just opened this PR instead.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe Airflow CLI and UI don't show Variables or Connections that are stored in a secrets backend. This can be really confusing if you don't already know that. This PR adds a warning to CLI commands and a warning banner to the list connections and list variables views in the UI when a user has enabled a secrets backend. The warning just explains that connections and variables stored in secrets backends won't be displayed using the CLI or UI.\r\n\r\nCloses: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/10867","created_at":"2022-10-13T13:40:02Z","updated_at":"2023-01-24T00:11:37Z","closed_at":"2023-01-24T00:11:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"84d8762e5d1b7fb61d31204b744df18b30560fbd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale PRs per the .github/workflows/stale.yml policy file"},{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":1672279581,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjcyMjc5NTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:CLI","name":"area:CLI","color":"e99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

making it so we can omit the prefix in `get_connection_form_widgets`, we left `get_ui_field_behaviour` alone because, even though maybe it's unlikely and probably not a great idea, it's *possible* that a user would want to add an extra field that shares a name with an existing conn attr _and_ want to provide a placeholder for that field.\r\n\r\nBut, after turning my attention back to this area, I think I arrived a at a reasonable way to solve this, which should make things easier for users when trying to implement extra fields for hooks.\r\n\r\nWhat we do is, check the placeholders when processing the hook in the providers manager, and if there are any fields which are not conn attrs and are not prefixed already, we add the prefix.  We don't need to worry about \"hidden fields\" or \"relabeling\" because these are only used with the built-in conn attrs.\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-11T18:33:27Z","updated_at":"2022-10-18T06:48:38Z","closed_at":"2022-10-14T19:25:06Z","merged_at":"2022-10-14T19:25:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"e58e42446292174ab0302ea7cd26628aa60882eb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1993586993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTkzNTg2OTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/kind:documentation","name":"kind:documentation","color":"1ED98E","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2172800850,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwODUw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:improvement","name":"type:improvement","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

a task is set to `deferred` or `up_for_reschedule`, we decrement the try number to keep it all in the same file.

to replace `unittests.TestCase` by native `pytest` classes for **all** charts tests.\r\n\r\nAll changes are straight forward:\r\n- Get rid of `unittests.TestCase`\r\n- Replace decorator `parameterized.expand` by `pytest.mark.parametrize`. I cant see any benefits if compare to builtin `pytest`.\r\n- Rename ClassName**Test** to **Test**ClassName\r\n- Replace `unittests.TestCase.assertRaises` by `pytest.raises`\r\n\r\nExcept two modules\r\n- `tests/charts/test_pod_template_file.py` - move fixture out of the class\r\n- `tests/charts/test_rbac.py` - `unittests.TestCase.assertCountEqual` has no equivalent in `pytest`, so i replace by compare sorted lists\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTested locally in breeze and did not have any differences if compare to current (local) main\r\n\r\n_This PR (run 5 times)_\r\n```\r\n792 passed, 1
