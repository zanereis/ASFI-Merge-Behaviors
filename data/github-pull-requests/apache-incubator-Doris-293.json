bin的优化中，在RecycleDatabaseInfo中增加了保存tableid的变量，用于支持根据id区分不同的同名table。但是这个信息在之前版本的元数据中是没有的，导致旧版本的fe升级到新的版本（VERSION_114）后，原有回收站中的database不能正确恢复，属于 https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/13067 pr代码的新旧版本的兼容性bug。\r\n\r\n建议将该代码合并到包含 https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/13067 相关的分支中\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nWhen unique key with MOW table has sequence column,  the query result may be wrong with predicates. There are two problems: \r\n1. The sequence column needs to be removed from primary key index when comparing key.\r\n2. The sequence column needs to be removed from min/max key.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n3. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n5. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n6.

Proposed changes\r\nIt is a painful work to read profile, especially there are multi-parallel instances.\r\nThis tool helps us to grasp the main information of profile in a graphical view.\r\n\r\nThe profile is represented by a tree. \r\nSql operation nodes contains operation type(join, scan...), its node id, its fragment id. The number on the arrow edge means how many rows output by child node. This tool will sum the output rows of the same node in multi-parallel instances, that is if there are 4 parallel instance, and each ScanNode on `lineitem` table output 10 rows, the label on the arrow beginning with ScanNode(lineitem) is 40.\r\n\r\nHere is a demo for tpch Q2\r\n[tpch q2 profile viewer](https://github.com/englefly/profile_viewer/blob/main/q2.nrf.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #14389\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nRemote Storage support single file when Cooldown.\r\nIn old cooldown, one replica will create one remote file, it will create too many replicas in remote storage, because remote storage already support replicas.\r\nIn this case, several replicas in local files will upload to one file in remote storage.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nIn old case, 1 tablet has 3 replicas,  they are on BE1, BE2, BE3, when cooldowning, each replica will be uploaded as one replica on remote storage. As result, 1 tablet will create 3 replicas on remote storage.\r\nBut, remote storage has its own replica controller, 1 replica is enought.\r\nSo, this pr will create a policy, cooldown will create only 1 replica instead of 3 replicas.\r\n\r\nThis pr realize FE, FE will get replica cooldownType in tabletReport which is used to dicide which BE will used to upload file, others will only get meta from remote, but not upload file.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-18T07:19:08Z","updated_at":"2023-01-28T02:07:17Z","closed_at":"2023-01-28T02:07:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fe6c7b92d76a916453e09b5d419538086ac63e63","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1992285151,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTkyMjg1MTUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/meta-version-change","name":"kind/meta-version-change","color":"e11d21","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nWhen executing `create table as select` stmt,\r\nthe varchar/char/string type of column in created table will be unified to `string` type.\r\n\r\nBecause when select from external table (mysql/pg, etc), the length of varchar in external database\r\nis calculated by \"char\" length, not \"byte\" length.\r\nSo if there is a column with `varchar(10)` in external table, then there will be a same `varchar(10)`\r\nin created table. But the byte length of data in external table may be larger than 10, causing failure of CTAS.\r\n\r\nChange to string will not impact performance of the capacity of disk storage.\r\nAnd notice that if a string type column is the first column, it will be changed to `varchar(65535)`,\r\nbecause we do not allow string type column as sort key column.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis PR is to make sharing hash table for broadcast more robust:\r\n1. Add a session variable to enable/disable this function.\r\n2. Do not block the hash join node's close function.\r\n3. Use shared pointer to share hash table and runtime filter in broadcast join nodes.\r\n4. The Hash join node that doesn't need to build the hash table will close the right child without reading any data(the child will close the corresponding sender).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Problem Summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n5. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n6.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n~~Issue Number: close #xxx~~\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nAccording to the description in [https://www.gnu.org/server/mirror.html](https://www.gnu.org/server/mirror.html), using the address `http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/` to download GNU packages is recommended. It can boost the download speed worldwide.\r\n\r\n> Downloading from mirrors\r\nFirst, for users/downloaders: the address http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/ multiplexes between the mirrors, trying to choose one that is nearby and up to date. E.g., http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/emacs/ goes to a mirror's directory of [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). We recommend using this generic ftpmirror.gnu.org address wherever possible in links, documentation, etc., to reduce load on the main GNU server.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-17T07:28:11Z","updated_at":"2022-11-18T16:04:57Z","closed_at":"2022-11-18T16:04:53Z","merged_at":"2022-11-18T16:04:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"eb76160b488541f6fb2db76e7d925e8f58214b8c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates
