pull request includes changes for running Python Combine load tests with Flink Streaming and optimizes the flink cluster creation script with high mem options.  Two small load tests are performed:\r\n\r\n* **Small Fanout 1**: This test runs with a fanout of 1.\r\n* **Small Fanout 2**: This test runs with a fanout of 2.\r\n\r\nThese tests were previously failing and are now enabled in this PR after addressing stability issues.  Two large load tests with fanout 4 and 8 remain disabled, which should be addressed by #33251.\r\n\r\nTested the changes with https://github.com/apache/beam/actions/runs/12107984164\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#33238\r\n\r\nThis problem happens whenever a StreamWriter is created after the table's schema is updated. The new StreamWriter [ignores the previously updated schema](https://github.com/googleapis/java-bigquerystorage/blob/main/google-cloud-bigquerystorage/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/bigquery/storage/v1/StreamWriter.java#L576-L591) and ends up using the base schema, dropping the new columns. \r\nSuch a case can happen when a pipeline decides to increase its parallelism (e.g. autosharding of threads or autoscaling of workers) **after** a schema update happens. The increased parallelism creates new stream writers that continue using the base schema, ignoring the updated schema. \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by fetching the stream's schema whenever we create a new append client. Existing tests are modified to cover this case, and new tests are added for schema update with dynamic destinations.","created_at":"2024-11-26T22:24:09Z","updated_at":"2025-01-08T16:43:20Z","closed_at":"2025-01-08T16:43:20Z","merged_at":"2025-01-08T16:43:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"b4c3a4ff927c052d503378aeb1584c82fe457c47","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1836391716,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM2MzkxNzE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/java","name":"java","color":"001cf2","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1839326366,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM5MzI2MzY2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/build","name":"build","color":"cf8af7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842356709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyMzU2NzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/io","name":"io","color":"9ee534","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842938092,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyOTM4MDky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/gcp","name":"gcp","color":"9ee534","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/milestones/26","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/milestone/26","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/milestones/26/labels","id":11717345,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAwi8tc4Assrh","number":26,"title":"2.62.0

PreCommit Flink Container workflow\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new PreCommit workflow to test Flink container functionality across Go, Python, and Java SDKs. The workflow runs combine load tests in each language to verify the Flink container's functionality.\r\n\r\n### Key Features\r\n- Runs on pull requests targeting Flink-related changes\r\n- Tests container functionality with three SDKs:\r\n  - Go Combine test\r\n  - Python Combine test\r\n  - Java Combine test\r\n- Uses self-hosted runner with Ubuntu 20.04\r\n- Includes automatic Flink cluster setup and teardown\r\n- Maintains consistent test parameters across languages\r\n\r\n### Implementation Details\r\n- Triggers on:\r\n  - PRs affecting Flink runners\r\n  - Push to master/release branches\r\n  - Manual workflow dispatch\r\n- Uses Docker environments for each SDK\r\n- Sets consistent parallelism and test parameters\r\n- Includes proper error handling and cleanup\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n- Timeout set to 45 minutes for complete workflow\r\n- Individual test steps timeout at 10 minutes\r\n- Cluster teardown happens even if tests fail\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Related PRs\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

issue with `DATETIME`: `BigQueryAvroUtils::toGenericAvroSchema` favors generating schema for the reading side and generates an avro field with `string(datetime)` type. This can't be used on write (expecting `long(local-timestamp-millis)` or `long(local-timestamp-micros)`).\r\n\r\nSee note in [doc](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/loading-data-cloud-storage-avro#logical_types)\r\n> When exporting to Avro from BigQuery, DATETIME is exported as a STRING with a custom logical time that

Adds a new runner named `highmem22` based on `c3-highmem-22` node\r\n- Adds `TotalNumberOfQueuedAndInProgressWorkflowRuns` to the runner autscaler metrics list. This will allow to scale from zero as `PercentageRunnersBusy` cannot do that. This metrics is only considered if number of runners is zero and allows to start the scaling. \r\n- Moves `PostCommit_Python_Examples_Flink` to `highmem22`\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#33020 and #33021. Basically, Beam should return TypeError like `TypeError: Unable to deterministically encode '2000-01-01' of type '<class 'numpy.datetime64'>', please provide a type hint for the input of 'GroupByKey' [while running 'CreatePInput0/Map(decode)']`.
