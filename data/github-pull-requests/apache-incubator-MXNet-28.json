Description ##\r\nCurrent trace names are not unique, for example, if a model consists of two `Conv2d` layers, the corresponding trace names are the same, something like `Convolution`. In order to make each layer in trace results hold a unique name, the following changes have been made:\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x]  For Module API, update `src/executor/graph_executor.cc`, substitute `inode.source->op()->name` with `opr_names += inode.source->attrs.name `.\r\n- [x] For Gluon API\r\n** Update `src/engine/threaded_engine.cc`, allow profiler mode to be `kSymbolic`.\r\n** Update `src/imperative/imperative_utils.h`, use `attrs.name` to substitute `op->name`. To maintain the lifecycle of `attrs.name`, use a global variable (type unordered_set string) to store it. To force profile the input and output op, assign priority 1 to the first and last node when calling PushSync, if `attrs.name` is not empty.\r\n\r\nAn example of the test results is shown below:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"name\": \"hybridsequential0_conv0_fwd\",\r\n    \"cat\": \"operator\",\r\n    \"ph\": \"B\",\r\n    \"ts\": 1572512095582317,\r\n    \"pid\": 64,\r\n    \"tid\": 1623894732768404781\r\n }\r\n...\r\n{\r\n    \"name\": \"hybridsequential0_conv1_fwd\",\r\n    \"cat\": \"operator\",\r\n     \"ph\": \"E\",\r\n    \"ts\": 1572512095582642,\r\n    \"pid\": 64,\r\n

Description ##\r\nThis PR is to improve the gluon quantize API, including below changes:\r\n\r\n-  fixed when input's ndim is larger than 4 -> [GluonCV PR#1000](https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-cv/pull/1000)\r\n- exposed quantize_mode to `quantize_net `function explicitly\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @ZhennanQin @xinyu-intel \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nQuantized Embedding operator maps integer indices to quantized int8 vector representations, and will pass down min,max values to the next operator.\r\n\r\nThis operator has been tested on NCF model and the accuracy loss is acceptable.#16689\r\n\r\nDue to the limited model accuracy evaluation, we registered this operator with `kSupport` QuantizeType.\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel

$JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-01T03:46:10Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T12:38:44Z","closed_at":"2019-12-09T12:38:44Z","merged_at":"2019-12-09T12:38:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"e48ff96ef4375f3d7c505e152b73b1f15a8b7afe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":998884732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTg4ODQ3MzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Quantization","name":"Quantization","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"Issues/Feature

Description ##\r\nShould fix #16629 \r\n- install MKL-DNN binaries to a lib folder, ignore the different behavior from cmake installation on different OS distributions.\r\n- same as before, only copy libmkldnn.so.1 to mxnet/lib folder.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-01T03:34:29Z","updated_at":"2019-11-02T03:51:34Z","closed_at":"2019-11-01T06:36:14Z","merged_at":"2019-11-01T06:36:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"9f6e819d38edb34bea125faeec508a6da7a8bb1c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16690/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16690/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16690/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/1c92c09237455650c1730213bf13cb4237555b01","head":{"label":"TaoLv:v1.0/fix-mkldnn-install","ref":"v1.0/fix-mkldnn-install","sha":"1c92c09237455650c1730213bf13cb4237555b01","user":{"login":"TaoLv","id":22437510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22437510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv","html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":113452572,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTM0NTI1NzI=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"TaoLv/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TaoLv","id":22437510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22437510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv","html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] data preprocess for MovieLens datasets\r\n- [x] ncf training on MovieLens dataset\r\n- [x] ncf evaluation and benchmark on MovieLens dataset\r\n- [x] ncf int8 quantization on MovieLens dataset\r\n- [x] ncf training/inference/quantization smoke test\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-01T03:23:35Z","updated_at":"2019-11-16T08:59:48Z","closed_at":"2019-11-16T08:59:48Z","merged_at":"2019-11-16T08:59:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"ec2f3a61109f68013ac6b0a9e68db7f9ccc9811a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":718413113,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MTg0MTMxMTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Example","name":"Example","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16689/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16689/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16689/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/3ec839b4221b2021f09e19b88aa6bccddc3661d9","head":{"label":"xinyu-intel:ncf_model","ref":"ncf_model","sha":"3ec839b4221b2021f09e19b88aa6bccddc3661d9","user":{"login":"xinyu-intel","id":17897736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk3NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17897736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel","html_url":"https://github.com/xinyu-intel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123092331,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjMwOTIzMzE=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"xinyu-intel/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinyu-intel","id":17897736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk3NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17897736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel","html_url":"https://github.com/xinyu-intel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/received_events","type":"User","user

Description ##\r\nTo achieve better performance, the Intel OMP and llvm OMP is recommended as below instruction. Otherwise, default GOMP will be used and you may get the sub-optimal performance.\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not

Description ##\r\nIn symbolic model parallel computation where different nodes of the same compute graph are assigned to different physical devices, MXNet automatically inserts appropriate cross-device-copy operations whenever necessary. Though the internally generated copy does not work for any data type other than float32. Reason is that the properties of the CrossDeviceCopy are missing an explicit function for type inference (though they surprisingly have one for shape inference). So type inference falls back to the default implementation associated with the base operator class, which is an old dummy routine that just accepts fp32 data as input and output (defined in include/mxnet/operator.h, method OperatorProperty.InferType)\r\n\r\nThis fixes that problem by providing an appropriate type inference method for cross-device copy.\r\n\r\nNote that this is only an issue for the symbolic interface, not for imperative nd.array interface (this is apparently based on a different implementation). \r\n\r\nThis bug is currently blocking development of a concrete application based on mxnet as this application uses symbolic API for good reasons and also needs to work with fp64 data.  \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove

Description ##\r\nSome problems that the primitives cannot be executed  or give wrong results will appear in the case below,\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/b5d07e30321da47d604b99048c1b57c03ec819b0/tests/python/unittest/test_operator.py#L103-L108\r\n\r\nFor better performance of `forward(is_train=True)`, `ReorderWeights` is no longer used as forward training only uses plain memory. When we then invoke `forward(is_train=False)`, the required `ReorderWeights` may not be executed as the operator has been already initialized. As a consequence, the forward primitives may give wrong results. The same thing will happen with `EmplaceNetArgs`, which results in the unable executing of primitives. Currently, we use `ctx.is_train || ctx.need_grad` to check if the operator requires preparing data for forward training. Things become more complicated with the usage above, especially with `grad_req` specified. It needs a further design for the stateful RNN operator. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Must reorder and emplace weights in initailization.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Actually, reorder and emplace must be executed over the previous commit before b38d6a9ab415bba8c6c0d0cddf0f2ffcaff53a27. But it has a mistake in the code, which was fixed by b38d6a9ab415bba8c6c0d0cddf0f2ffcaff53a27. This PR just fixes the problem above based on that commit. We left a never used variable `is_train` in `SetWeightsMem(...)` for some potential uses of further design.\r\n- We prefer to have #16555 merged due to the limited time to 1.6 release.\r\n@TaoLv

Description ##\r\nWhen sharing parameters between Blocks, gluon checks that all attributes of to-be-shared parameters match. However, as mxnet initializers don't implement `__eq__`, the check will always fail. Thus it is currently impossible to share parameters between Blocks with custom initializers.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16049\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Support sharing parameters between

(i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n@PatricZhao @TaoLv @ZhennanQin @ciyongch @wuxun-zhang

###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Fix for `expand_dims`'s boolean support\r\n- [x] Fix for #16658 \r\n- [x] Make resulting ndarray's dtype consistent with a source official numpy ndarray\r\n- [x] corresponding tests\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\nFix the issue filed by https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/16555#issuecomment-547000155. Previously, we don't need `Concat` to concatenate pieces of weights to a continuous space with unidirectional 1-layer RNN. Thus, `mkldnn::memory::set_data_handle(ptr)` is directly used to fetch the weights, and `ptr` is the pointer of weights shifted from `NDArray`. When it runs into `gru` mode, a swap mechanism of gates is used to swap weights of the reset gate and the update gate. If we use `set_data_handle` here, it will crash the naive memory from `NDArray`.  As a result, the gru operator swaps the naive memory every iteration when `is_train=True`. It will then give inconsistent results. We should use `memcpy` here.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Move `set_data_handle` to `memcpy`.\r\n\r\n@ciyongch @pengzhao-intel @TaoLv

Description ##\r\nTVM implementation for binary ops (add and multiply as an example)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- float16 is not supported for tvm ops\r\n- additional temp space needed for backward, as reduction cannot be inlined\r\n- schedule is not tuned\r\n- Thank @yzhliu @reminisce  @haojin2  for guidance.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-28T18:11:13Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T09:43:35Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"898ae9c64946dad0acdb05f0603d9b73e26bb23c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16660/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16660/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16660/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/488efb26c1fa58e7c5dac8d4c258238ba50bd695","head":{"label":"hzfan:bin_pr","ref":"bin_pr","sha":"488efb26c1fa58e7c5dac8d4c258238ba50bd695","user":{"login":"hzfan","id":18756967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzU2OTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18756967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan","html_url":"https://github.com/hzfan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":192095733,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTIwOTU3MzM=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"hzfan/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hzfan","id":18756967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzU2OTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18756967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan","html_url":"https://github.com/hzfan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hzfan/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n@TaoLv @pengzhao-intel \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

Description ##\r\n\r\nTo get some background on the PR, please go through the related github issue : https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16431 . Below, I have added a brief overview for the PR.\r\n\r\n## Brief Overview ##\r\n\r\n1. This PR adds a multithreaded inference interface (EXPERIMENTAL) for MXNet. The approach it takes for this is to add a thread safe version of cached op with minimal set of features required for inference.\r\n2. Adds C API to create cached op thread safe version: The API: CreateCachedOpEX takes an additional parameter `thread_safe`. When `thread_safe` is set to true, invokes on the cached op handle will invoke the thread safe version of cached op.\r\n```\r\n  /*!\r\n   * \\brief create cached operator, allows to choose thread_safe version\r\n   * of cachedop\r\n   */\r\n  MXNET_DLL int MXCreateCachedOpEX(SymbolHandle handle,\r\n                                   int num_flags,\r\n                                   const char** keys,\r\n                                   const char** vals,\r\n                                   CachedOpHandle *out,\r\n                                   bool thread_safe DEFAULT(false));\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. This PR adds tests and verification for thread safety of engine, for running parallel inference with the thread safe version of CachedOp with different models and different number of threads and different number of inferences per thread.\r\n4. Model Testing has been limited to : resnet18, resnet50_v1, resnet152_v1\r\n5. Adds CI stages and CI tests for running the thread safety tests. Please see : `capi-cpp-package GPU` in `unix-gpu` stage.\r\n\r\n## Feedback/Acknowledgements ##\r\n\r\nBelow is the feedback/help received from offline code/design reviews:\r\n\r\n1. @nswamy - Early inputs and offline design discussions related to this project, specifically with respect to dmlc::ThreadLocalStore.\r\n2. @frankfliu - Explaining the requirements and use case for MXNet backend from a customer perspective, code review suggestions to have thread safe API for Create only and to determine whether to invoke cached op/cached op threadsafe based on handle.\r\n3. @andreaolgiati  - Suggestion to document current threading model of MXNet (still a TODO), requesting adding support for dynamic shapes for NLP case (not supported yet), suggested documenting the long term plan with respect to thread safe inference in mxnet. (Documented in limitations and Future work section of the doc, will add required github issues).\r\n4. @lanking520 , @larroy , @zachgk - Suggestion to add a new API for Threadsafe cached op version, since modifying existing one will break backward compatibility.\r\n5. @frankfliu and @oorqueda - Suggestion for continuous maintenance (addition of support) of the models supported table. Will be maintained on the doc and RFC issue.\r\n6. @samskalicky - offline code review suggestions with respect to code comments for locking strategy and comments for changes made for thread safe cached op.\r\n7. @vikas-kum - better document the performance benefits. [still a TODO]\r\n\r\nThanks to all above for the suggestions, review and feedback.\r\n\r\nThanks to @marcoabreu and @arcadiaphy for the valuable comments on the RFC. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, thanks to @roywei, @access2rohit , @stu1130 , @ChaiBapchya , @rondogency , @yuxihu, @vrakesh, @Keerthanvasist, @josephevans for code/design review.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease

doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-27T05:24:54Z","updated_at":"2019-10-28T01:06:53Z","closed_at":"2019-10-27T23:36:27Z","merged_at":"2019-10-27T23:36:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"ffc5392d6c1328258cbdb8ceae724f055a8cae76","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16643/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16643/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16643/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/70efedb21adf538efe39c06b2ed7c1f4c2e10d34","head":{"label":"hzfan:bug_pr","ref":"bug_pr","sha":"70efedb21adf538efe39c06b2ed7c1f4c2e10d34","user":{"login":"hzfan","id":18756967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzU2OTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18756967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan","html_url":"https://github.com/hzfan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":192095733,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTIwOTU3MzM=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"hzfan/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hzfan","id":18756967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzU2OTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18756967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan","html_url":"https://github.com/hzfan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzfan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hzfan/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nAdds large tensor support to contrib.index_array, changes the implementation to use cudaMemcpyAsync (#16583), adds a parameter called `target_axis` that makes it easier to use this operator together with operators which expect the index dimension to be the first (such as `gather_nd`), adds a definition for FIgnoreInputs, and adds a dtype parameter.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Large tensor support, with nightly test.\r\n- [x] Use cudaMemcpyAsync instead of cudaMemcpy.\r\n- [x] Add a target_axis parameter that changes the axis for the indices.\r\n- [x] Add FIgnoreInputs.\r\n- [x] Add a dtype parameter.\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\nNative numpy does not support sampling directly from Bernoulli distribution, in order to do so, users have to use `np.random.binomial` and set `n = 1` manually.\r\nHowever, I think a separate implementation for Bernoulli is worth consideration for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Sampling from a bernoulli, unlike binomial, is very easy to implement.\r\n2. `random.bernoulli` could be temporarily used as a ''work around'' for binomial sampling, see https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/071971476d7431a24e527bdc181981678055a95d/torch/distributions/binomial.py#L102 for more details. ( also, some discussions: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/20343 )\r\n\r\nThis pull request also fixes an existing bug in `np.random.uniform`, where scalar tensor would cause infer shape failure.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the

Description ##\r\nFix support of RNNOp in GPU build on CPU machines.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nContinue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15905.\r\n\r\n1. Add support of basic symbolic indexing, currently we support the following indexing types\r\n    - integer types\r\n    - python slice\r\n    - tuple of the above two types for multi-axis slicing\r\n\r\n2. Fixes the MKLDNN integration of MXNet, which does not support 0-size NDArray. Currently, the solution is to disable MKLDNN if the size of input is 0.\r\n3. Support loading and saving symbols in the Numpy interface\r\n4. Add two testing utility functions:\r\n    - check_hybridize_consistency, this is added to test_utils\r\n    - check_gluon_save_load\r\n\r\nOnce merged, this will fix https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16279 and https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16887\r\n\r\nFollowup work will be to support Ellipsis in the symbolic interface.\r\n##

Description ##\r\nSpeeding up the take operator for the general case (when axis != 0). Speeds should now be comparable to when axis = 0 on GPU, as opposed to being multiple times slower (depending on the shape of the array). CPU also receives a speedup, but not necessarily as fast as axis = 0.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Modified Take kernel to run faster\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note: The Take kernel now assumes that when the take operator is called with axis=0, TakeGPU/TakeCPU will be used instead, and thus is now incompatible with axis=0\r\n- Requesting @ptrendx to review\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-25T00:01:35Z","updated_at":"2019-10-26T03:27:11Z","closed_at":"2019-10-26T03:27:11Z","merged_at":"2019-10-26T03:27:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"0712f00a2a1fd0d33db97678a176064017a0e75d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16615/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16615/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16615/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/823f6ada59b670de45d5a85721a335ee23c3fbe9","head":{"label":"blchu:faster_general_take","ref":"faster_general_take","sha":"823f6ada59b670de45d5a85721a335ee23c3fbe9","user":{"login":"blchu","id":8587304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1ODczMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8587304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blchu","html_url":"https://github.com/blchu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blchu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blchu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blchu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blchu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blchu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blchu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blchu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blchu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blchu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":217413391,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTc0MTMzOTE=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"blchu/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"blchu","id":8587304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1ODczMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8587304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blchu","html_url":"https://github.com/blchu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blchu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blchu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blchu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blchu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blchu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blchu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blchu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blchu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blchu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/blchu/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

[ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n@ZhennanQin @ciyongch @TaoLv @PatricZhao

Description ##\r\nThis PR addresses a problem noticed when reviewing issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16572, and should fix the issue as well, as will be verified by @haojin2 (thanks!).\r\n\r\nRecent PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/16391 introduced a cudaEvent to solve a race condition in the cuDNN implementation of RNNOp under some conditions.  If the MXNet framework was compiled to use CUDA/CUDNN, this cudaEvent would be 'created' under all scenarios, including non-GPU RNNOps and on systems with no GPU present.  The cudaEventCreateWithFlags() call however cannot be made on systems with no GPU present.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the cudaEventCreateWithFlags() lazily, only when the event is first used (so necessarily then on a system with a GPU).  Further, the thread that creates the event will have the GPU context set properly for any later calls to cudaEventRecord(). It is likely the case that on a multi-GPU setting, the main Python thread would have the context set improperly for later use of the event on an arbitrary GPU (so the issue mentioned).\r\n\r\n##

Description ##\r\n`Block.save_parameters` currently stores a separate copy of shared parameters for sub-block which uses the shared parameter. This is wasteful. Instead only store a single copy.\r\nThis change is backwards compatible; all existing valid serialized files continue to work. However, newly serialized files will be smaller in case they contain shared parameters.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Don't serialize shared parameters twice in Gluon `Block.save_parameters`\r\n\r\n## Comments

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\nImplementation of numpy append operator in mxnet.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

Description ##\r\n...for speeding up data loading under numpy mode.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

Description ##\r\nThis is an effort from the whole Intel MXNet team. Credits belong to everyone in the team.\r\n\r\nThis PR upgrades the 3rdparty/mkldnn dependency to it's v1.0.x release which has many API breaking changes and is not backward compatible to the previous v0.x versions. Hence this PR also changes the integration code in operators while keep the integration methodology and software architecture the same. Development has been done on the feature branch `mkldnn-v1.0` and tracked via github project: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/projects/16. \r\n\r\nPlease see the discussion here: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/f46ab920f18795496eafe713e6e9e561c684e06189085cec17b401dc@%3Cdev.mxnet.apache.org%3E\r\nPlease see MKL-DNN v1.0 RFC here: https://github.com/intel/mkl-dnn/tree/rfc-api-changes-v1.0/doc/rfc/api-v1.0\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the dev@ thread, this PR also removes the mklml and iomp5 library which previously are distributed along with MXNet pip package. So it also fixes the license issue in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/15544. It's a requirement for 1.6.0 release.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

[MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

Description ##\r\n`StaticAllocMemory` in `CachedOp` used `storage_inplace_index` attribute (generated by `MXPlanMemory` graph pass) to assign reqs for edges in the graph. However, the `MXPlanMemory` pass is called only once per the type of memory plan (full, forward or backward). While the memory plan itself is stored in separate attributes in the graph (`forward_mem_plan`, `full_mem_plan` etc.), the `storage_inplace_index` (and so the reqs) were overwritten by the last called `MXPlanMemory`.\r\n\r\nThe following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwith mx.autograd.record():\r\n   result = net(x)\r\nresult.backward()\r\n\r\nresult2 = net(x)\r\n\r\nwith mx.autograd.record():\r\n   result3 = net(x)\r\nresult3.backward()\r\n```\r\n\r\ncalls first the plan memory for the full graph and then for just the forward graph. The third invocation to `net` does not invoke a plan memory pass. Let us assume that inside `net` is an op that produces the output needed for the backward pass only when needed (req not set to `kNullOp`). Since the reqs are overwritten by the second `net` invocation, that output's req is set to `kNullOp` (because there is no backward pass there). Then the 3rd invocation to `net` does not change the req value and so the op does not produces the required output - `result3` gradient is therefore produced using the stale values and so is wrong.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by changing the `StaticAllocMemory` to use per mem plan values to assign reqs (`storage_inplace_index_forward` etc.) to keep the benefits of caching (`MXPlanMemory` called once per type) while ensuring correctness.\r\n\r\n@eric-haibin-lin \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes

Description ##\r\nPython docstring convention is not consistent through out codes. This PR changes some files to respect [PEP docstring convention](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/). Do you guys think this can be enforced with a linter?\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc

items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not
