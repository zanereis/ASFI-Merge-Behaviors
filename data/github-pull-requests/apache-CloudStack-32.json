Description\r\n\r\n#### Proposal\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes adding Exception UnavailableCommandException at the ExceptionErrorCodeMap.\r\n\r\n#### Why?\r\n\r\nWhen an API command is \"blocked\" due to the User's role not allowing it, an UnavailableCommandException is thrown. However, this leads to multiple logs such as:\r\n\r\n `Could not find exception: com.cloud.exception.UnavailableCommandException in error code list for exceptions`\r\n\r\nThis escalates to a level that it gets hard to understand what is going on, especially if there have been multiple API commands refused (e.g. logging on UI with an User that has lots of API restrictions, thus failing many commands such as `list*`)\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n...\r\n2021-04-15 16:00:48,454 INFO  [c.c.u.e.CSExceptionErrorCode] (qtp477376212-29347:ctx-34fbeee5 ctx-ca7a23a4) (logid:f56ab770) Could not find

which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [X] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n1. Build\r\n2. Upgrade test environment\r\n3. Place breakpoints and tail logs to verify `CSExceptionErrorCode`\r\n4. Assert that the INFO log is not printed:  `Could not find exception: com.cloud.exception.UnavailableCommandException in error code list for exceptions`\r\n\r\nLines which were validated to be working as expected via remote debug at [CSExceptionErrorCode.java#L89](https://github.com/PCextreme/cloudstack/blob/6e020172e28e818c7f9866fcff2fe59eee3d7763/utils/src/main/java/com/cloud/utils/exception/CSExceptionErrorCode.java#L89):\r\n```\r\n    public static int getCSErrCode(String exceptionName) {\r\n        if (ExceptionErrorCodeMap.containsKey(exceptionName)) {\r\n ->         return ExceptionErrorCodeMap.get(exceptionName); //  when exception matches  `UnavailableCommandException` code is 4555\r\n        } else {\r\n            s_logger.info(\"Could not find exception: \" + exceptionName + \" in error code list for exceptions\");\r\n ->          return -1; // no occurrences happened on tests, as expected\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, checked the logs and no occurrences of the INFO lines were found. The only log is the relevant one of `The API listCapabilities does not exist or is not available for this account.`\r\n\r\nExample of the log with the patch:\r\n```\r\n\r\n2021-04-16 00:29:17,289

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR includes fixes to complete the Korean language support of the new CloudStack UI.\r\n\r\nCloudStack explains that it supports Korean, but only some features are translated. Compared to the en-us.json file, it is not up to date on new features.\r\n\r\nTo support Korean language support for new features and more modern Korean language support, the contents of en-us.json were copied to the ko-kr.json file and retranslated into Korean.\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the issue raised at #4545 (_Fail to change Service offering from local <> shared storage_).\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading a VM service offering it is validated if the new offering has the same storage scope (local or shared) as the current offering. I think that the validation makes sense in a way of preventing running Root disks with an offering that does not match the current storage pool. However, the validation only compares both offerings and does not consider that it is possible to migrate Volumes between local <> shared storage pools.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind this implementation is that CloudStack should check the scope of the current storage pool which the ROOT volume is allocated; this, it is possible to migrate the volume between storage pools and list/upgrade according to the offerings that are supported for such pool.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes an issue where the API command that lists offerings for a VM should follow the same idea and list based on the storage pool that the volume is allocated and not the previous offering.\r\n\r\nFixes: #4545\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [X] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [X] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n**Prior the fix:**\r\n1.

Description\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/4808, https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/4941\r\nThis PR adds a force flag to the attachIso / detachIso commands, especially for VMware where it is noticed that when trying to either detach an iso or attach an iso when there already exists another present it fails to do the necessary operation as from ACS end we either answer the question returned by Esxi for CDRom disconnect operation as No (for detach operation) or do not answer the question at all (for Attach operation), thus leading to the following exception:\r\n```\r\n2021-04-12 05:32:41,367 ERROR [c.c.s.r.VmwareStorageProcessor] (DirectAgent-62:ctx-3f28a2a0 10.0.32.174, job-564, cmd: AttachCommand) (logid:5d45a935) AttachIsoCommand(attach)

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a bash script file that manages sshkey and password from userdata server and configdrive sources\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\nAt first, the script tries to find a configdrive CD, if it is found, it will mount the CD and search for ssh key and password.\r\nIf both ssh key and password were found, the script will try to set ssh key and password, else it will search for the userdata server.\r\nFinding a userdata server (DHCP server) is a little bit tricky.\r\nFirst of all the script tries to find the default gateway, so it can determine the default nic. It is important to find default nic because CloudStack only provides passwords from default nic.\r\nScript test existence of different commands to figure out default gateway: ip, netstat, route (GNU & BSD)\r\nIf no default gateway was found, the script will fall back to the \"data-server\" DNS record.\r\nAfter finding the default gateway and default nic, the script will try to find the latest DHCP server IP for that nic by using available commands or analyzing lease files.\r\nIf OS is using netplan, the script can directly ask for the DHCP server address.\r\nIf OS is using nmcli, the script can use the \"next_server\" field for the DHCP server address.\r\nIf OS is using wicked, the script can find the DHCP server address from the lease file.\r\nIf OS is using udhcpc, the script will get DHCP server address from a file that is created by a post-bound hook script for udhcpc\r\nOtherwise, the script will search in a list of possible directories that lease files may exist. Then aggregate all lease records files and histories and filters records that have \"option routers\" (Only default nics has this parameter)\r\nThen the script will create a list consist of lease expiration time, interface, and DHCP server address.\r\nThe script will filter only records from default nic and pick the one which has the greatest timestamp.\r\nSo the DHCP server address will be found this way. If the script was not able to find the DHCP server address, it will fall back to the \"data-server\" DNS record.\r\nThen the script will ask for ssh key and password from the userdata server, then it

For an env with one cluster with two hosts load the first host to max\r\n2. Remove **RandomAllocator** from `host.allocators.exclude` and set `host.allocators.order` to **RandomAllocator,FirstFitRouting**\r\n3.

Description\r\nOn `BackgroundPollManagerImpl`, each submitted task needs to implement delay's configuration; otherwise it will assume the delay (which acts like the execution interval, not an actual delay) `4000ms` (hardcoded).\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to externalize the OOBM delay's configuration.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing

Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIt has been tested locally on a test lab.\r\n1.

Description\r\nACS has an API to scale VMs `scaleVirtualMachine`, however dynamic scale of VMs is limited to `XenServer` and `VMWare`.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends suport live scale for VMs on `KVM`.\r\n\r\nWhen we are using a custom service offerings, KVM's XML only receives the boot memory, but with this changes it will receive the max values defined in the service offerings. If it is a unconstrainced service offering, max values will be the `vm.serviceoffering.cpu.cores.max` and `vm.serviceoffering.ram.size.max` values . If they are `0`, max values will be host or last host capacities.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nI created unit tests for the code that is being introduced here. Moreover, it has been tested locally in a test lab. I created multiples VMs with multiples definitions and tested API with they:\r\n\r\n| VM STATE | INIT CPU CORES | UP TO | INIT RAM SIZE | UP TO | SERVICE OFFERING | RAM SERVICE OFFERING | CPU SERVICE

Description\r\nThis PR is a fix for the data volume import and export functionality when using swift as secondary storage.\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nSecondary storage is used for templates, snapshots and iso's. A data disk is a volume and is meant to reside on primary storage. However, when importing a volume it is first uploaded to secondary storage and then copied to over to primary storage when attached to a VM. Similarly when exporting a volume, it is copied to secondary storage before it is made available to the user for download. When using swift as a secondary storage, an intermediate staging nfs store is needed when copying volumes between primary and secondary storage. This staging nfs store is leveraged for the volume import and export functionality since volumes need not have a footprint on secondary storage.\r\n\r\nCurrently this functionality does not work:\r\n\r\nWhen importing a volume the following error is observed:\r\n\r\n`org.apache.cloudstack.storage.to.VolumeObjectTO cannot be cast to org.apache.cloudstack.storage.to.TemplateObjectTO\r\n`\r\n\r\nFurther investigation reveals that there is no provision in the code to handle import of volumes. Currently only template import is supported.\r\n\r\nWhen exporting a volume a URL to the secondary storage is generated but it clicking it does not initiate a download of the exported volume. Further investigation revealed that the url points to a broken symlink which points to an invalid path on the SSVM\r\n\r\nUse Cases\r\n\r\n1. User should be able to import a volume from a URL when using swift as secondary storage and XenServer as the hypervisor.\r\n2. User should be able to export a volume to a secondary storage VM URL when using swift as secondary storage and XenServer as the hypervisor.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\nThis addresses https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/4874\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [*] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [*] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\n1.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the capability to VPC VR to answer \"data-server\" DNS queries based on the source IP of the VM.\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n1. Creates a new record for \"data-server\" translated to VR IP of newly create subnet in /etc/hosts file\r\n2. Configure dnsmasq to send response of \"data-server\" query based on source IP of VM\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\n<!--\r\nFor bugs, show exactly how to reproduce the problem, using a minimal test-case. Use Screenshots if accurate.\r\n\r\nFor new features, show how the feature would be used.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste example playbooks or commands between quotes below -->\r\n~~~\r\n1. Create a VPC\r\n2. Add an isolated network with UserData service with VirtualRouter as provider\r\n3. Create a VM in this network\r\n4. Run \"nslookup data-server\" command from inside of VM\r\n5. Run \"cat /etc/hosts\" command from inside of VR\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n<!-- You can also paste gist.github.com links for larger files -->\r\n\r\n##### EXPECTED RESULTS\r\n<!-- What did you expect to happen

Description\r\n\r\nDatastore cluster as a primary storage support is already there. But if any changes at vCenter to datastore cluster like addition/removal of datastore is not synchronised with CloudStack directly. It needs removal of primary storage from CloudStack and add it again to CloudStack.\r\n\r\nHere synchronisation of datastore cluster is fixed without need to remove or add the datastore cluster.\r\n1. A new API is introduced syncStoragePool which takes datastore cluster storage pool UUID as the parameter. This API checks if there any changes in the datastore cluster and updates management server accordingly.\r\n2. During synchronisation if a new child datastore is found in datastore cluster, then management server will create a new child storage pool in database under the datastore cluster. If the new child storage pool is already added as an individual storage pool then the existing storage pool entry will be converted to child storage pool (instead of creating a new storage pool entry)\r\n3. During synchronisaton if the existing child datastore in CloudStack is found to be removed on vCenter then management server removes that child datastore from datastore cluster and makes it an individual storage pool.\r\nThe above behaviour is on par with the vCenter behaviour when adding and removing child datastore.<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\nAdded datastore cluster with two child datastores as a primary storage pool into CloudStack\r\nCase 1: Removal of child datastore from vCenter\r\n1.

According to the Performance (PERFORMANCE), Dm: Method invokes inefficient new String(String) constructor (DM_STRING_CTOR).\r\nUsing the java.lang.String(String) constructor wastes memory because the object so constructed will be functionally indistinguishable from the String passed as a parameter.  Just use the argument String directly.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a missing break at the HTTP request re-try loop.\r\n\r\nIt is a minor bug, but it can result in double re-try requests where one should be enough. Also, talking about corner cases, there is a small possibility of the first re-try request be successful, and the second fails, which could result in _false error_.\r\n\r\nThis PR added the break and also Test cases that cover such scenarios to ensure that now we have it all covered.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### **DISCLAIMER**\r\n\r\nThis PR has fixed the log issue caused by the misplaced `String.format` attributes at https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/4846/commits/cd5fe4bf8df66893740fe3e0e507aa290d4e3b0b; merged in the context of #4846 and correctly reverted at #4861.\r\n\r\nTo make sure all is good I re-build with the fix, and also executed all unit tests.\r\n```\r\n$ mvn clean install\r\n.....\r\n[INFO] Apache CloudStack Console Proxy ....................

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows the management servers to renew certificates issued to hosts, even if ca.plugin.root.auth.strictness is false.  There is already a global setting named ca.framework.cert.automatic.renewal that should be controlling the certificate renewals.  However, ca.plugin.root.auth.strictness currently circumvents that setting.\r\n\r\n#### More Detail\r\n\r\nThe ca.plugin.root.auth.strictness setting is checked early in the client certificate checking method and exits the method without adding the certificate to the management server's in-memory certificate map if strictness is false.  The certificate renewal process (if enabled with ca.framework.cert.automatic.renewal) reads that in-memory certificate map to determine what certs it could renew.  Those two settings shouldn't be so closely related.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a small bug when explicitly setting VM hardware versions lower than version 10.\r\n\r\nVmware expects the hardware version in format: `vmx-DD` where DD is a two-digit representation of the virtual hardware version. For hardware version lower than 10, CloudStack was not using to digits for the hardware version number, which ended up on an error while creating worker VMs. (`vmx-8` for example instead of `vmx-08`)\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows the management servers to renew certificates issued to hosts, even if ca.plugin.root.auth.strictness is false.  There is already a global setting named ca.framework.cert.automatic.renewal that should be controlling the certificate renewals.  However, ca.plugin.root.auth.strictness currently circumvents that setting.\r\n\r\n#### More Detail\r\n\r\nThe ca.plugin.root.auth.strictness setting is checked early in the client certificate checking method and exits the method without adding the certificate to the management server's in-memory certificate map.  The certificate renewal process (if enabled with ca.framework.cert.automatic.renewal) reads that in-memory certificate map to determine what certs it could renew.  Those two settings shouldn't be so closely related.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a missing break at the HTTP request re-try loop.\r\n\r\nIt is a minor bug, but it can result in double re-try requests where one should be enough. Also, talking about corner cases, there is a small possibility of the first re-try request be successful, and the second fails, which could result in _false error_.\r\n\r\nThis PR added the break and also Test cases that cover such scenarios to ensure that now we have it all covered.\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE:

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the default project role permission type to 'deny' as project role permissions are basically restrictive in nature, i.e., they are used to deny users/accounts in a project from performing certain actions that they would be allowed at the account-level, hence making sense to have the default permission to be Deny.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!---

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue pertaining to volume resize on VMWare for deploy as-is templates. VMware deploy as-is templates are those that are deployed as per the specification in the imported OVF. Hence override root disk size will not be adhered to for such templates. Moreover, when we deploy VMs in stopped state and resize the volume, the root disk doesn't get resized but the volume size is merely updated in the DB.\r\nThis PR also includes the following (for deploy as-is templates):\r\n- Disables overriding root disk size during VM deployment on the UI\r\n- Disables selection of compute offerings with root disk size specified, at the time of deployment\r\n- Provided users with the option to deploy VM is stopped state via UI (so as to give an option to users to resize the volumes before starting the VM)\r\n\r\n<!---

VM doesn't seem to have gotten resized:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10495417/111328782-90598600-8694-11eb-9dce-b867c43604a4.png)\r\n\r\n#### Post fix\r\nDeployed a VM in

8GB\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10495417/111328916-aff0ae80-8694-11eb-9c3c-a38dd6a10146.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10495417/111328948-b717bc80-8694-11eb-82a6-ba925cc0afd2.png)\r\n\r\nNotice

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR is more an POC and I need some opinions.\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nMany of my admins have the problem that they are get an vm name with a problem but not the related project. In this situation they must check all project to find them. Currently they are using a script to get all vm's with related projects, but they want also a opportunity in the ui. \r\n\r\nFor this reason I build up a new command class as a first step and after this I want to create a search field in the ui to see a list of vm names and the related project names. I'm continue thought me that the admin can click on the vm in this list to jump into the vm details or he can click on the project to see the project list view with all vms.\r\n\r\n========\r\nThe api call works and I get all VM's independent of a certian project . But i have headache with some points.\r\n\r\n1. Currently I get to much informations of the vm and I have concerns that I break the permission concept of cloudstack.\r\nThe only things that I have found is to set the ReponseView to restricted and the details != all. \r\n\r\n2. When I call this api call via cloudmonkey, I get the correct and valid json but I get also this error \"on parsing and printing list index out of range\". Not sure if it a bug of cloudmonkey or a misconfiguration of my ReponseView\r\n\r\n3. Not sure which package the right one is to store the new command. \r\n\r\n  \r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows the rest of the storage plugins to implement and use the storage/volume statistics directly instead of sending cmd to hosts, not only ScaleIO. With this change, we check if the plugin could provide storage/volume statistics.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and

Description\r\nOn API `resetSSHKeyForVirtualMachine`, ACS also regenerates VM password when it uses a template with `Password Enabled` as true; there is already anAPI to reset VM password, therefore, the reset SSH keys API should not reset the VM SSH password as well.\r\n\r\nBesides running a meaningless process, the VM's password regeneration slows down the main process and may cause a confusion in operations due to password change in the VM without being explicity requested.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to remove the meaningless password regeneration from `resetSSHKeyForVirtualMachine`. \r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt has been tested locally in a test lab.\r\n1. I created VM with a template with `Password Enabled` as true.\r\n2. I logged in VM with the generated password on creation.\r\n3. I stopped the VM and called the API.\r\n4. I started the VM and tried to login with the password. Before this changes, the password would be changed and I could not login to the VM because I did not have the password anymore. After this changes, I could login

Description\r\nThis PR fixes the issue that new storage pool can not be used in the first few minute after adding to cloudstack.\r\n\r\nsteps to reproduce the issue\r\n(1) change global setting vm.allocation.algorithm to 'firstfitleastconsumed' (this allocator orders host/storage by capacity, maybe other algorithim has same issue).\r\n(2) create a zone and enable it\r\n(3) systemvm cannot be created, until Capacity Checker runs (it runs every 5 minutes).\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide

`cloud.host_view`.\r\n```\r\nMariaDB [cloud]> select id,name,tag from host_view where type='ROUTING'\\G\r\n*************************** 1. row ***************************\r\n  id: 1\r\nname: ref-trl-755-k-M7-abhishek-kumar-kvm1\r\n tag: tag1\r\n*************************** 2. row ***************************\r\n  id: 1\r\nname: ref-trl-755-k-M7-abhishek-kumar-kvm1\r\n tag:

host response for first found entry for an ID using `newHostResponse`/`newHostForMigrationResponse` and for remaining entries calls `setHostResponse`/`setHostForMigrationResponse` so that remaining tags can be added to the response.\r\n```\r\n(localcloud) SBCM5> > list hosts type=ROUTING filter=id,name,hosttags\r\n{\r\n  \"count\": 2,\r\n  \"host\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\":

contain comma-separated multiple tags.\r\nDB entries after the change:\r\n```\r\nMariaDB [cloud]> select id,name,tag from host_view where type='ROUTING'\\G\r\n*************************** 1. row ***************************\r\n  id: 1\r\nname: ref-trl-755-k-M7-abhishek-kumar-kvm1\r\n tag: tag1,tag2\r\n*************************** 2. row ***************************\r\n  id: 2\r\nname: ref-trl-755-k-M7-abhishek-kumar-kvm2\r\n tag: NULL\r\n2 rows in set (0.00 sec)\r\n```\r\nAPI returns the same response as the code has been refactored to use the new `cloud.host_view`:\r\n```\r\n(localcloud) SBCM5> > list hosts type=ROUTING filter=id,name,hosttags\r\n{\r\n  \"count\": 2,\r\n  \"host\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\":
