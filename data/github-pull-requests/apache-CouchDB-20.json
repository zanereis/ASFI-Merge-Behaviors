Overview\r\n\r\nIn a59540132 we introduced a default increase in process priority for `couch_server` to high.\r\n\r\nWhile tracking down #2437 , I managed to git bisect the problem to this commit.\r\n\r\nThis lead me to this thread on erlang-questions:\r\n\r\nhttp://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2018-June/095677.html\r\n\r\nNotably:\r\n\r\n> a single high-priority process in a tight loop stops all other processes, including those of max priority.\r\n\r\nThis problem surfaces on Erlang 21 and 22 specifically - and is exactly what we're seeing.\r\n\r\nWhile we could do a specific version check, I think it would be healthier for now to disable this specific optimization by default, and only re-enable once we can track down what's going on in 21/22 that is causing scheduler collapse in this fashion.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`while true; do make eunit apps=mem3; done` should run for hours without a hang. Most commonly the hang occurs in the reshard tests (during which various `couchjs` processes are spawned.)\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nCloses #2437 and may help with #2423 - needs more testing.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [X] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [X] Any new configurable parameters are documented in

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nWhen a user issues a range query $lt, $lte, $gt, $gte for text indexes,\r\nthe query is translated into a MIN, MAX range query against clouseau.\r\nIf not quoted, an error occurs:\r\n```\r\n{\"error\":\"text_search_error\",\"reason\":\"Cannot parse\r\n'(a_3astring:[\\\"\\\" TO string\\\\ containing\\\\ space})'..}\r\n```\r\nThis is because the string is broken up into 3 tokens which the parser\r\ncannot parse. If we add quotes to the string, the the range query works\r\ncorrectly.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nTests added to mango test suites, but requires clouseau to be setup. Text tests have already\r\nbeen run and passes.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to

Overview\r\n\r\nIn #2411 we introduced a setting to allow _up to not require authentication when require_valid_user is set to true. However it was flawed and caused an infinite loop, rendering the /_up handler ineffective.\r\n\r\nWe move the check to the party_mode_handler and remove the infinite loop.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\ndev/run with all combinations of the two config flags, _up handler called with curl to confirm behaviour.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n#2411 for original PR that this corrects.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [x] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text.

Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed.

reports the URI that you use to interact with Couch.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nWhen Mango text indexes fetch the doc object for each hit, a not_found atom may be returned if the indexed document revision no longer exists in the primary index (see [mango_cursor_text:get_json_docs/2](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/bf6b98420c6a79c2f2d144edb4164b070b686afb/src/mango/src/mango_cursor_text.erl#L333)).\r\n\r\nThis manifests in the couchdb logs as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreq_err(2299526675) unknown_error : function_clause#012 [<<\"mango_selector:match/2 L57\">>,<<\"mango_cursor_text:handle_hit/3 L182\">>,<<\"mango_cursor_text:handle_hits/2 L169\">>,<<\"mango_cursor_text:execute/1 L145\">>,<<\"mango_cursor_text:execute/3 L116\">>,<<\"mango_httpd:handle_find_req/2 L189\">>,<<\"mango_httpd:handle_req/2 L38\">>,<<\"chttpd:handle_req_after_auth/2 L322\">>]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis commit handles this explicitly in `mango_cursor_text:handle_hit/3` to prevent the mango selector being evaluated against an invalid object.\r\n\r\ncc @garrensmith @tonysun83 \r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nTricky to test explicitly - there are some basic eunit tests to cover the change in behaviour.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to those issues or pull requests here.  -->\r\n\r\n##

Overview\r\n\r\nAdds builtin reduce indexes for CouchDB on FDB. The reduce indexes are created using a skiplist like data structure. See the [RFC](https://github.com/apache/couchdb-documentation/pull/441) for the full details. \r\n\r\nThis work is not 100% complete. Currently, the reduce index cannot update an index when a document is updated as it will not remove the original document from the index. \r\n\r\nThere are two ways to query the index. By default a query of the reduce index will read through the full skiplist to return the results. But if you add the parameter `use_skiplist=false` it will only read from the level = 0 of the skip list and compute the group_level results in memory. level = 0 of the skiplist is equivalent of `group=true` for reduce.\r\n\r\nI'm currently at the point where I need feedback from the rest of the team on how best to finish the work. The Skiplist algorithm works but it does seem a bit slow and its pretty complex. I need help on the following things:\r\n\r\n1. Review the skip list traversing algorithm to see if we can improve it and make it faster\r\n1. Review the add keys to the skip list and see if there are any bugs or issues with this\r\n1. Finally should we continue with the skip list implementation? Or should we rather go with a reduce index that just stores the equivalent of the level 0 keys for the skiplist, and then calculate the reduce group levels in memory when returning the results. \r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nNew tests have been added.

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed.

If no value is set (the default), no `SameSite` attribute is added.\r\n\r\nThis also updates Mochiweb to v2.20 as this is required for `SameSite` support.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nSet the `samesite: strict` value in default.ini and verify that the SameSite attribute is detected by a browser (e.g. Chrome dev tools).\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n * Refs #2221\r\n

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an ability to selectively enable opentracing for HTTP requests\r\nwith X-B3-... headers. This is helpful in following cases:\r\n- tracing all requests with X-B3-... headers\r\n  `all = (#{external := E}) when E == true -> true`\r\n- tracing all requests to specific database with X-B3-... headers\r\n  ```\r\n  all = (#{external := E, 'db.name' := Db})\r\n    when E == true andalso Db == <<\"foo\">> -> true\r\n  ```\r\n- tracing requests to specific endpoint with X-B3-... headers\r\n  ```\r\n  db.design.view.read = (#{external := E, 'design.id' := Name})\r\n    when E == true andalso Name == <<\"bar\">> -> true\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nI want to remind that we support following X-B3-... headers:\r\n\r\n- `X-B3-TraceId`\r\n- `X-B3-SpanId`\r\n- `X-B3-ParentSpanId`\r\n- `B3` which is in the following format\r\n  `<TraceId>-<SpanId>-<1 | 0>-<ParentSpanId>`\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n0. Run test suite \r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ make eunit apps=ctrace\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Write connection string into fdb.cluster file\r\n2. Start FDB server\r\n3. Update rel/overlay/etc/default.ini similar to this:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[tracing]\r\nenabled = true\r\nthrift_format = compact ; compact | binary\r\nagent_host = 127.0.0.1\r\nagent_port = 6831\r\napp_name = couchdb\r\n\r\n[tracing.filters]\r\n; Log all traces\r\nall = (#{external := External}) when External == true -> true\r\n```\r\n4. Start jaeger `docker run -d -p 6831:6831/udp   -p 16686:16686   jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.14`\r\n5. Start couchdb `dev/run --admin=adm:pass`\r\n6. Create database `curl -X PUT -u adm:pass http://127.0.0.1:15984/test`\r\n7. Query database `curl -X GET -u adm:pass http://127.0.0.1:15984/test -H 'X-B3-TraceId: 12345678901234567890123453782027'`\r\n8. Open http://localhost:16686/ in the browser and search for spans\r\n9. Query database `curl -X GET -u adm:pass http://127.0.0.1:15984/test`\r\n10. Make sure there are no traces for the call from step `#9`\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to Step 4, you can run the `jaeger-all-in-one` binary without arguments in a separate shell. The Jaeger project provides prebuilt binaries for download.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Overview\r\n\r\nPreviously many HTTP requests failed noisily with `function_clause` errors.\r\nExpect some of those failures and handle them better. There are mainly 3 types\r\nof improvements:\r\n\r\n 1) Error messages are shorter. Instead of `function_clause` with a cryptic\r\n internal fun names, return a simple marker like `bulk_docs_failed`\r\n\r\n 2) Include the error body if it was returned. HTTP failures besides the error\r\n code may contain useful information in the body to help debug the failure.\r\n\r\n 3) Do not log or include the stack trace in the message. The error names are\r\n enough to identify the place were they are generated so avoid spamming the\r\n user and the logs with them. This is done by using `{shutdown, Error}` tuples\r\n to bubble up the error the replication scheduler.\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/2413\r\n\r\n### Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n   `make eunit` \r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by

If the authentication scheme is implemented such\r\nthat the whole request fails if some docs don't have enough permission to be\r\nwritten, then the replication job ends up crashing with an ugly exception and\r\ngets stuck retrying forever.

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThe previous implementation of Mango execution stats relied on\r\npassing the docs_examined count from each shard to the coordinator\r\nin the view_row record. This failed to collect the count of\r\ndocuments read which weren't followed by a match (in a given shard).\r\nFor example, if an index was scanned but no documents were matched,\r\nthe docs_examined would be 0, when it should be equal to the number\r\nof documents in the index.\r\n\r\nThis changes the implementation so that docs examined is passed\r\nonly when each shard has completed its index scan. This requires a new\r\nhandler in fabric so care needs to be taken if including this in a rolling cluster upgrade.\r\n\r\nThe work is split into 2 commits in order to support mixed-version upgrades. The first commit\r\nincludes only the message handlers, so can be safely rolled out without breaking in-flight requests. The second commit will cause CouchDB to start sending the new message.\r\n\r\ncc @garrensmith \r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nImprove instrumentation of Mango with the following metrics:\r\n\r\n * `mango.query_invalid_index`: number of mango queries that generated an invalid index warning\r\n * `mango, docs_examined`: number of documents examined by mango queries (the same value returned by execution_stats for individual queries). This is counted on the shard level (i.e. where the work occurs) rather than at the query coordinator.\r\n * `mango.quorum_docs_examined`: number of documents examined by mango queries, using cluster quorum. These are always evaluated by the query coordinator.\r\n * `mango.results_returned`: number of rows returned by mango queries\r\n * `mango.query_time`: histogram of the length of time processing mango queries\r\n * `mango.too_many_docs_scanned`: number of mango queries that generated an index scan warning\r\n * `mango.evaluate_selector`: number of calls to `mango_selector:match`\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nMake some Mango queries and call `_node/_local/_stats/mango` to view the metrics. Note that there is a bug in execution stats which means documents read are only counted when documents are matched (see #2412, which should ideally land before this).\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n * Prior art: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1913\r\n * Documentation PR: https://github.com/apache/couchdb-documentation/pull/469\r\n * Fauxton PR: https://github.com/apache/couchdb-fauxton/pull/1245\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [x] Any new configurable parameters

Overview\r\n\r\nDuring the initial copy phase target shards are opened outside the\r\ncouch_server. Previously, it was possible to manually (via remsh for instance)\r\nopen the same targets via the couch_server by using the `couch_db:open/2` API\r\nfor example. That could lead to corruption as there would be two writers for\r\nthe same DB file.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent such a scenario, introduce a mechanism for the shard\r\nsplitter to lock the target shards such that any regular open call would fail\r\nduring the initial copy phase.\r\n\r\nThe locking mechanism is generic and would allow local locking of shards for\r\npossibly other reasons in the future as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n   `make eunit`\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by

Overview\r\n\r\nThis is some work to speed up the test suites to try and reduce our build times. The work on the JavaScript tests is to avoid a hardcoded 1.2s delay between tests for the various config changes to settles.\r\n\r\nFor most of the eunit tests all of these changes are to move the `meck:new/1` calls into a setup function and *out* of the `foreach` setup fixture. It turns out that creating and unloading meck modules is somewhat expensive. This ends up saving about a total of 2m out of the total 10m it takes to run before this PR (eunit alone to be clear).\r\n\r\nAll in all this shaves about 3-4m off the full `make check` run on my laptop.\r\n\r\nI've left all of the EUnit test changes as separate commits in case any of these turn out to be flaky when run in CI. This way we can revert individual test changes more easily if need be.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`make check`\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [x] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed.

Overview\r\n\r\nExperimentation with the `rexi:stream2` interface's unacked message limit demonstrates possible performance gains for multiple database behaviors.\r\n\r\nThe `rexi:stream2` interface is used in a few different behaviors:\r\n  - replication document streaming\r\n  - `_changes_feed` streaming\r\n  - view rows streaming\r\n  - mango/view rows streaming\r\n\r\nEach area deserves performance benchmarking. This change introduces the stream limit configurability but leaves the default value unchanged at 10 unacked messages. Credit to Adam K. and others at Cloudant for recommending the change, I just benchmarked it.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThe change itself is pretty simple. The impact on performance has more study to go but looks interesting. I performed some benchmarking for view queries but more testing is recommended before actually tuning this parameter in production.\r\n\r\n### View Query throughput\r\n\r\nI benchmarked view queries with some infrastructure we have at Cloudant. This was against a 12 node cluster based on `24 cores, 2x (E5-2690-V3-DodecaCore)` CPUs with 110 GiB of memory and 4 `~1TB INTEL SSDSC2BA012T4` SSDs in a RAID10 array. 1000 keys are randomly requested from a 10M document database using the `startkey` and `limit` query parameters for 3 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe default stream limit is 10 unacked messages. I saw interesting results when I lowered that limit to just 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nq | stream_limit | mean rows | std-dev % | ratio | 3 std-dev %\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n8 | 10 | 173614106.7 | 0.12 |   |  \r\n8 | 5 | 187940682 | 0.56 | 1.08251965 | 1.718138528\r\n32 | 10 | 77188191.67 | 0.22 |   |  \r\n32 | 5 | 99207830 | 0.37 | 1.28527211 | 1.291394595\r\n96 | 10 | 20762084 | 0.24 |   |  \r\n96 | 5 | 30782750.67 | 0.35 | 1.48264262 | 1.27314571\r\n192 | 10 | 8904000 | 0.59 |   |  \r\n192 | 5 | 14036990 | 0.21 | 1.57648136 | 1.878776197\r\n\r\n\r\nAt q=192 we see a 57% view row throughput performance increase. A sample of one iteration at `rexi.stream_limit = 10` v. `5` demonstrates an improvement in individual request latency and not just parallelization. Latency units are microseconds.\r\n\r\n```\r\nstream_limit = 5\r\nelapsed,     window,     n,       ops,  min,      mean,       median,   95th,     99th,     99_9th,   max,      errors\r\n10.000281,

Overview\r\n\r\nA .git directory found in src/ usually indicates that the code in the\r\nenclosing directory is managed from said .git directory. This can lead\r\nto confusion, and developers opening PRs against obsolete repos when, as\r\nhappens frequently, a formerly separate repository becomes integrated\r\ninto the primary repo.\r\n\r\nThis patch changes the configure script to warn when it finds such .git\r\ndirectories.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nExample output:\r\n```\r\n$ ./configure --dev --skip-deps\r\n==> configuring couchdb in rel/couchdb.config\r\nWARNING unexpected .git directory src/couch_tests/.git\r\nWARNING unexpected .git directory src/rexi/.git\r\nWARNING unexpected .git directory src/mem3/.git\r\nWARNING unexpected .git directory src/smoosh/.git\r\nWARNING unexpected .git directory src/couch_mrview/.git\r\nWARNING unexpected .git directory src/couch/.git\r\nWARNING unexpected .git directory src/couch_replicator/.git\r\nWARNING unexpected .git directory src/ddoc_cache/.git\r\nWARNING unexpected .git directory src/couch_peruser/.git\r\nWARNING unexpected .git directory src/setup/.git\r\nWARNING unexpected .git directory src/couch_log/.git\r\nWARNING unexpected .git directory src/couch_epi/.git\r\nWARNING unexpected .git directory src/mango/.git\r\nWARNING unexpected .git directory src/chttpd/.git\r\nWARNING unexpected .git directory src/couch_stats/.git\r\nWARNING unexpected .git directory src/global_changes/.git\r\nWARNING unexpected .git directory src/couch_event/.git\r\nWARNING unexpected .git directory src/fabric/.git\r\nWARNING unexpected .git directory src/couch_plugins/.git\r\nWARNING unexpected .git directory src/ken/.git\r\nWARNING unexpected .git directory src/couch_index/.git\r\nYou have configured Apache CouchDB, time to relax.

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThis adds a couple of improvements to remsh following an incident where I needed to use it in a CouchDB deployed via Helm. The CouchDB docker container and Helm chart both utilize `ERL_FLAGS` to set the Erlang cookie. Unfortunately, this interferes with `./remsh`, which adds it's own `-setcookie` parameter when calling `erl` - you end up with multiple `-setcookie` and, in the case of the Helm chart, multiple `-name` parameters, resulting in Erlang failing to connect to the remote node.\r\n\r\nThe PR firstly sets `ERL_FLAGS` to empty when invoking `erl`, to avoid conflicts with explicitly set parameters. Secondly, it attempts to automatically locate the cookie from `ERL_FLAGS` or `vm.args` which should yield a better default than `monster` in most cases.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\nTesting is a little tricky as it requires a CouchDB deployed using ERL_FLAGS and/or vm.args. I tested it by building a CouchDB release / Docker container locally and passing `-e ERL_FLAGS=\"-setcookie somecookie\"` to `docker run`.    \r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to those issues or pull requests here.  -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nUnlike most other fabric_db_* message handlers, the accumulator\r\nfor fabric_db_info has 3 terms. When a rexi timeout occurs, it\r\nreturns `{timeout, Accumulator}`; the case clause handling this\r\nneeds to expect 3 terms in the Accumulator instead of 2.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nI can't see a good precedent for testing this but I'm happy to add a test if somebody can point me to an example.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nFixes #2350\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR

The second commit makes the modifications described above.\r\n\r\ncc @davisp \r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\nPort SpiderMonkey from `1.8.5` to `6.0`, i.e `mozjs-60.1.1pre3` from https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/spidermonkey/prereleases/60/pre3/ aligning with the version used in planned CouchDB 4.0. This allows CouchDB 3.0 to address existing issues in legacy spidermonkey version and use new features provided in new version of spidermonkey.\r\n\r\nOne outstanding topic is about CouchDB-style function declaration. \r\n`\"map\": \"function(doc) {emit(doc._id, doc._id);}\"`\r\n\r\nBy means of the original transpile idea from the couch-chakra PoC from @dmunch, currently both traditional CouchDB-style function declaration and  modern function declaration like below are supported in CouchDB 3.0 if spidermonkey 6.0 is selected.\r\n\r\n`\"map\": \"(function (doc) {emit(doc._id, doc._id);});\"`\r\n\r\nIn order to provide enough flexibility, one switch is introduced when running `configure`. Currently, the supported value is `1.8.5` and `60`. (the default value is 1.8.5 and will be changed to 60 later)\r\n```\r\n./configure  --spidermonkey-version 60 (non-windows version)\r\npowershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass .\\configure.ps1 -WithCurl -SpiderMonkeyVersion=60 (windows version)\r\n```\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\nAll tests below are involved and run successfully again.\r\n```\r\n - Make test-cluster-with-quorum\r\n - Make test-cluster-without-quorum\r\n - Make eunit\r\n - Make
