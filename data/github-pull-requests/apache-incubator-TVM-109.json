QNN dialect only deals with uniform quantization, which means each tensor has just one scale and zero point. Because of this restriction, QNN design had scale and zero points as op attributes. However, as we move towards channel quantization, scale will become a vector (and behave similar to something like bias for bias_add in terms of ops inputs).\r\n\r\nBefore moving to channel quantization, this PR makes the necessary changes to make the scale and zero points as input expr to operators (instead of making them op attrs). So, this PR does not bring any functional/performance change to QNN graphs. The new type checks still check that scale and zero points must be const scalar values. Once this PR is merged, and we start moving towards channel-wise quantization, we can start relaxing the checks and modifying the lowering.","created_at":"2020-01-02T23:04:18Z","updated_at":"2020-01-03T13:40:42Z","closed_at":"2020-01-03T13:39:57Z","merged_at":"2020-01-03T13:39:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"0720ed67390e9d28d7e544410dde32fbe2919059","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

brings new classes that allows us to migrate the visitor mutator to be sub-class of these functors.\r\n\r\nList of changes:\r\n\r\n- Create separate class for ExprMutator and StmtMutator, following convention used in relay.\r\n- Introduce copy-on-write to StmtMutator that can later benefit the statement mutations\r\n  if we use move semantics and keep a single copy of stmt.\r\n- Move two generic

@trevor-m \r\n\r\nConvert Layout pass was earlier using SimplifyInference pass as a pre-requisite to expand batch norm to simpler ops. However, @trevor-m told that TRT offloading of Relay graph works better if we keep batch norm intact in Relay. This caused a problem with Convert Layout pass that inserts layout transforms with batch norm.\r\n\r\nThis PR propagates the new layout through batch norm, preventing the insertion of layout

PR improves the performance (not accuracy) of KL based calibration in two ways:\r\n\r\n* Current implementation stores entire samples for all layers in one go, this quickly becomes intractable in terms of memory usage for image segmentation tasks, where there are more than a hundred of intermediate outputs and high-res inputs are common. I added \"calibrate_chunk_by\" parameter to qconfig, which enables chunk-by-chunk, interleaved profile generation and scale calculation. This adds some redundant computation, but it is a worthwhile trade off. In practice, using the cuda target for profile generation, I don't find noticeable slowdown. The default behavior is to use the number of intermediate outputs as chunk size, so there will be only one chunk and performance is the same as existing implementation.\r\n\r\n* Port KL div minimization to C++. MXNet has [C++ implementation](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/quantization/calibrate.cc) now, so I replaced python one we have with that one. This turned out a big win, scale calculation is now 10-20x faster. Below is a log from running test_calibrate_chunk() that I added, showing elapsed seconds and found scales for python and cpp respectively. \r\n\r\n```\r\nelapsed py: 4.980973720550537\r\nelapsed cpp:

https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/issues/4286\r\nPreviously NDArray has its own object reference counting mechanism.\r\nThis PR migrates NDArray to the unified object protocol.\r\n\r\nThe calling convention of NDArray remained intact.\r\nThat means NDArray still has its own type_code and\r\nits handle is still DLTensor compatible.\r\n\r\nIn order to do so, this PR added a few minimum runtime type\r\ndetection in TVMArgValue and RetValue only when the corresponding\r\ntype is a base type(ObjectRef) that could also refer to NDArray.\r\n\r\nThis means that even if we return a base reference object ObjectRef\r\nwhich refers to the NDArray. The type_code will still be translated\r\ncorrectly as kNDArrayContainer.\r\nIf we assign a non-base type(say Expr) that we know is not compatible\r\nwith NDArray during compile time, no runtime type detection will be performed.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adopts the object protocol for NDArray sub-classing and\r\nremoved the legacy NDArray subclass protocol.\r\nExamples in apps/extension are now updated to reflect that.\r\n\r\nMaking NDArray as an Object brings all the benefits of the object system.\r\nFor example, we can now use the Array container to store NDArrays.","created_at":"2019-12-24T23:07:25Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T19:20:34Z","closed_at":"2019-12-30T06:16:27Z","merged_at":"2019-12-30T06:16:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"55bd786fe25f710f6f46769fb7175f44dd73b2ea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/4581/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/4581/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4581/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/6a2a1adf7c5aa01f04fe3fd3d7400418456ce41a","head":{"label":"tqchen:ndarray","ref":"ndarray","sha":"6a2a1adf7c5aa01f04fe3fd3d7400418456ce41a","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100638323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA2MzgzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"tqchen/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen/tvm","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/{archive_format}{/ref}","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqch

cast was introduced in #3387, but it causes an error in the following segment of a graph because one of the inputs to the concat op is int64 while the other is int32. In ONNX, unsqueeze(-1) is supposed to be int64, but relay makes it int32. The output of Shape is int64, after the fix in #4528. \r\n\r\nI don't know the context where this cast was introduced, but since the tests are passing without cast I assume it is no longer necessary. Can you review? @zhiics @jroesch \r\n\r\nI can explain why the output of Shape needs to be int64 (#4528), if desired. \r\n  \r\n

is the partitioning part of #4258 \r\n\r\n**Updated**\r\n\r\nHere, we only focus on partitioning and expect developers to annotate the program first. We provide some examples to help developers to write their own annotators using pass manager directly from Python frontend.\r\n\r\n**How to use**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmod = relay.testing.mobilenet.get_workload(batch_size=1, dtype='float32')\r\n# see unit test for examples of the annotator\r\nmod = MyAnnotator(arg1, arg2,...)(mod)\r\nmod = relay.transform.PartitionGraph()(mod)\r\njson, lib, param = relay.build(mod, target=target, params=params)\r\n```\r\nFollowup PRs will be sent to:\r\n- provide a convenient annotation framework which may need more discussion and thoughts on how to combine together with OpStrategy\r\n\r\n- tutorials to help developers add external codegen/runtime and create their own build pipeline.\r\n\r\n- add more comprehensive operator support for dnnl\r\n\r\nCC @tqchen @jroesch @icemelon9 @u99127 @masahi @u99127 @soiferj @comaniac

I also replace the existing frontend calls to DepthToSpace and SpaceToDepth to show the simplification.

when computing int8 gemm using Cublas, TVM will call CublasGemmEx, which doesn't actually take advantage of int8 tensor core's performance.  By using [cublasLt](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cublas/index.html#cublasLt-example-tensorop) (for cuda version >= 10.1), we speedup int8 gemm by up to 3.5x. Here's a performance comparison between CublasLt and current CublasGemmEx called by TVM on Telsa T4 GPU. CUDA version is 10.1, driver version is 418.39\r\n\r\n| (m, n, k) | CublasLt (TOPS) | Cublas(TOPS) |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| 1024   |   13.28    |    8.49    |\r\n| 2048   |   25.46 |    10.4     |\r\n| 4096   |   37.75  |     11.87   |\r\n| 6144    |   41.02  |     11.6     |\r\n| 8192    | 42.19    |    14.18 |\r\n\r\nNote that cublasLt Igemm requires input matrices to satisfy certain layouts in order to trigger IMMA tensor operations for tensor core: Matrix A and C memory ordering should be the same (CUBLASLT_ORDER_COL32), and matrix B should be in CUBLASLT_ORDER_COL4_4R2_8C layout. For best performance, we do these matrix transformations only once on python side, before passing the matrices to cublasLt.\r\n\r\n@Hzfengsy @masahi Could you

PR is not meant to give anyone a heart attack. @soiferj encouraged me to submit this PR so he could take a peek.  So please don't code review seriously for merge.  Feel free to close if you don't want to look at it :)\r\n\r\nTwo discuss topics related:\r\nhttps://discuss.tvm.ai/t/unofficial-autotvm-on-windows-guide/4711 (Google doc has notes on quirks)\r\nhttps://discuss.tvm.ai/t/added-windows-support-to-c-rpc-server/5007\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no support for autotvm in Windows out of the box.  Most challenges are related to fork() not being supported, which autotvm code uses extensively for getting multi-core performance in python.  Having no fork() means data sent to process pools must be able to be pickled.  Also, having no fork() means python pools or subprocesses need to be reused for performance reasons.  This was very apparent in the `local_executor.py`, where starting a new python subprocess w/ python entry point could take almost 1000ms.\r\n\r\nTo overcome these issues I have opted to use pathos library in some spots which uses dill to serialize.  dill can serialize much more than pickle, notably functions.\r\n\r\nI've tried to keep the linux behavior the same, but have not tested it.   Most of the time I \"ifdef\"ed the python code with `os.name == 'nt'` so it was easy to spot.\r\n\r\nNotable problems are:\r\n\r\n- Need to fix ipv6 in `base.py` `get_addr_family`\r\n- If IP_ANY (0.0.0.0) was having trouble, so i replaced IP_ANY with 127.0.0.1\r\n- local_executor.py, timeouts are not supported because a pool is used for perf reasons.  Timeouts will work on RPC server side if using the C++ RPC server.\r\n- I'm new to Python, so things may be able to be expressed better\r\n- Took some liberties with C++ RPC and main CMakeLists.txt, which may not be appreciated \r\n- Python RPC server, I restart the python subprocess after n-trials as some cuda kernels cause big leaks and killing the proc is the only way to fix.  I suggest the C++ RPC server as its much faster.\r\n- Possibly many more.\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-19T21:47:18Z","updated_at":"2020-10-11T18:31:01Z","closed_at":"2020-10-11T18:30:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"39b27a42e9cf2bb34f61a82d42b26fa01be04864","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/4548/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/4548/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4548/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/c727fb122825fd45e2a7f118367ec9925aa6d50b","head":{"label":"jmorrill:windows_support","ref":"windows_support","sha":"c727fb122825fd45e2a7f118367ec9925aa6d50b","user":{"login":"jmorrill","id":6867609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4Njc2MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6867609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmorrill","html_url":"https://github.com/jmorrill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmorrill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmorrill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmorrill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmorrill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmorrill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmorrill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmorrill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmorrill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmorrill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":216633022,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTY2MzMwMjI=","name":"tvm","full_name":"jmorrill/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jmorrill","id":6867609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4Njc2MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6867609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmorrill","html_url":"https://github.com/jmorrill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmorrill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmorrill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmorrill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmorrill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmorrill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmorrill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmorrill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmorrill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmorrill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jmorrill/tvm","description":"Open

our former RFC [Auto TensorCore CodeGen](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/issues/4105)，we have present the performance of fp16/int8 gemm based on auto tensor-core implementation. However, cuda's wmma instructions support more data types in the [experimental namespace](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#wmma-subbyte) since cuda10, which can be useful when combining with low bit quantizations. \r\n\r\nSeveral hacks still remain in the code which needs to discussion with you guys, because we have not found an elegant solution to deal with newly added data type int4/int1 in the arg bind pass.\r\n In our implementation, we store 8 int4/uint4 data or 32 int1 data into one int32，because int4/int1 is not a basic data type in cuda c or even numpy.\r\n\r\nWe implement support for int4/int1 tensor-core codegen based on auto tensor-core pass and provide an example on how to use it to generate gemm kernels. The command to run the sample int4/int1 gemm schedule is:\r\npython tutorials/autotvm/tensor_core_matmul_subbyte_int.py $M $N $K $dtype\r\n\r\nSupported data types are int4, int1. Only TN layout is supported for int4/int since it is the only layout supported by wmma's sub-byte fragments.\r\n\r\n# Perf on T4, CUDA10.1, Driver 418.39\r\nThe baseline data is cuBLASLt for int8 tensor-core gemm since no impls for int4/int1 were provided by cublas so far.\r\n\r\n|M, N, K| cuBLASLt int8 | TVM TensorCore int4 | TVM TensorCore int1

adds support for the custom operator TFLite_Detection_PostProcess which is commonly used in object detection networks such as SSD Mobilenet.

Their design is closely coupled to the mxnet version of this custom operator, so a number of transformations have to be added before and after to get them to accept the tflite format for this

**Problem Description**\r\nSome TOPI schedules such as `depthwise_conv2d_nchw` on x86 has no tuning space at all. However since `depthwise_conv2d_nchw` on CUDA has a tuning space, we still list `topi_nn_depthwise_conv2d_nchw` as an AutoTVM task. It means `depthwise_conv2d_nchw` on x86 will be extracted by `extract_from_program` and \"tuned\" by AutoTVM. The problem is that this will result in the following record in the history log file:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n{\"i\": [\"llvm\", \"topi_nn_depthwise_conv2d_nchw\", [[\"TENSOR\", [1, 192, 28, 28], \"float32\"], [\"TENSOR\", [192, 1, 3, 3], \"float32\"], [2, 2], [1, 1], [1, 1], \"float32\"], {}, [\"depthwise_conv2d_nchw\", [1, 192, 28, 28, \"float32\"], [192, 1, 3, 3, \"float32\"], [2, 2], [1, 1], [1, 1], \"float32\"], {\"i\": 0, \"t\": \"direct\", \"c\": null, \"e\": []}], \"r\": ...}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nTaking a closer look,  we will find an empty config:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n{\"i\": 0, \"t\": \"direct\", \"c\": null, \"e\": []}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough it is empty, it is still a valid record and will be loaded when `ApplyHistoryBest`. The problem is that when building with `opt_level=3` on x86, TVM will call AlterOp pass to replace NCHW to NCHWc. During this process, it tries to apply the empty config to the NCHWc schedule template, which results in the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  File \"/home/ubuntu/tvm/python/tvm/_ffi/_ctypes/function.py\", line 72, in cfun\r\n    rv = local_pyfunc(*pyargs)\r\n  File \"/home/ubuntu/tvm/python/tvm/relay/op/nn/_nn.py\", line 232, in alter_op_layout_conv2d\r\n    return topi.nn.conv2d_alter_layout(attrs, inputs, tinfos, op)\r\n  File \"</usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/decorator.py:decorator-gen-36>\", line 2, in conv2d_alter_layout\r\n  File \"/home/ubuntu/tvm/python/tvm/target.py\", line 382, in dispatch_func\r\n    return dispatch_dict[k](*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/ubuntu/tvm/topi/python/topi/x86/conv2d_alter_op.py\", line 98, in _alter_conv2d_layout\r\n    ic_bn, oc_bn = cfg[\"tile_ic\"].size[-1], cfg[\"tile_oc\"].size[-1]\r\n  File \"/home/ubuntu/tvm/python/tvm/autotvm/task/space.py\", line 806, in __getitem__\r\n    return self._entity_map[name]\r\nKeyError: 'tile_ic'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe most obvious case is tuning MoibleNet V2 on x86 which has lots of depthwise conv2d ops, and this problem has been reported by several topics [[1]](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/keyerror-tile-ic-when-tuning-mobilenet-for-mobile-gpu/4217)[[2]](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/keyerror-tile-oh-when-tuning-resnet50/4003)[[3]](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/x86-relay-auto-tune-mobilefacenet-error-using-relay/2508/16)[[4]](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/topi-depthwise-conv2d-config-application-error/4223). [One workaround](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/solved-keyerror-tile-ic-when-tuning-mobilenet/3757/4) suggests users replacing NCHW with NCHWc manually, but it is still confusing.\r\n\r\n### **Solution**\r\nThis PR proposes a quick fix to this problem by ignoring the records with an empty config when loading from the log file. I choose this solution instead of the following alternatives for reasons. The root solution is actually making up a tuning space for depthwise conv2d on x86 tho.\r\n\r\n* **Do not log empty config in callback**: We may be still interested in the result of this op with this schedule even it has no config.\r\n\r\n* **Use fallback config when the history best config has no entities**: Similar to what I proposed but it needs to modify more places.\r\n\r\ncc @eqy @merrymercy

we want to serialize(such as pickle.dumps) a tvm.tensor object， we will get a precision loss caused by std::to_string()。\r\nFor example, a2.value will be 0.0 while a.value=0.00000001 in the following: \r\n    import tvm\r\n    import pickle\r\n    a = tvm.const(0.00000001, 'float32')\r\n    a2 = pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(a))\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!
