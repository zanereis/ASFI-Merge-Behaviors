What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nBased on our benchmark of ExternalSpillableMap with large data, we noticed that higher amount of data is spilled to disk when using DiskBasedMap when compared to RocksDb, causing much higher GET latencies. One strong reason for this was that compression was not being used in DiskBasedMap, while RocksDb uses compression.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nCurrently we only support reading hoodie table as datasource table for spark since https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2283\r\nThat PR just sync the spark table properties from the `HoodieSparkSqlWriter`, which can not be used by other engine like flink.\r\nIn order to support this feature for flink and DeltaStreamer, we need to sync the spark table properties needed by datasource table to the meta store in `HiveSyncTool`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nSync the spark table properties and serde properties needed by spark datasource table in `HiveSyncTool` .

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds a new alternative based on RockDb for the Disk Based Map that is used within the ExternalSpillableMap. Our benchmark results shows that RockDb may improve performance significantly when the data set is large while available memory may be scarce. RockDb supports compression, efficient memory usage and native library, that may be more efficient in certain situations. By default, disk based map will be used, and a config change will be required to enable rocksDb.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the rocksDB support is only enabled for HoodieMergeHandle, and a subsequent PR will extend it to all consumers of ExternalSpillableMap (tracked here HUDI-2044)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Adds a new alternative based on RockDb for the Disk Based Map that is used within the ExternalSpillableMap.\r\n  - The support is currently added only for HoodieMergeHandle\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\nAdded the unit test in TestSpillableRocksDBBasedMap\r\nUpdated the test for

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds a new alternative based on RockDb for the Disk Based Map that is used within the ExternalSpillableMap. Our benchmark results shows that RockDb may improve performance significantly when the data set is large while available memory may be scarce. RockDb supports compression, efficient memory usage and native library, that may be more efficient in certain situations. By default, disk based map will be used, and a config change will be required to enable rocksDb.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the rocksDB support is only enabled for HoodieMergeHandle, and a subsequent PR will extend it to all consumers of ExternalSpillableMap (tracked here HUDI-2044)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Adds a new alternative based on RockDb for the Disk Based Map that is used within the ExternalSpillableMap.\r\n- The support is currently added only for HoodieMergeHandle\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\nAdded the unit test in TestSpillableRocksDBBasedMap\r\nUpdated the test for TestExternalSpillableMap\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-18T20:26:43Z","updated_at":"2021-06-20T04:54:18Z","closed_at":"2021-06-20T04:53:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4edfea0b88a6406d125e9c6ab50a652e0351f734","assignee":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/3112/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/3112/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3112/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/17ccf1dcc9212ff0e26862140a0409bf58c31412","head":{"label":"rmahindra321:rm_rocks_db","ref":"rm_rocks_db","sha":"17ccf1dcc9212ff0e26862140a0409bf58c31412","user":{"login":"rmahindra321","id":79297528,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5Mjk3NTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79297528?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra321","html_url":"https://github.com/rmahindra321","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra321/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra321/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra321/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra321/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra321/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra321/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra321/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra321/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra321/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":378245063,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzgyNDUwNjM=","name":"hudi","full_name":"rmahindra321/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rmahindra321","id":79297528,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5Mjk3NTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79297528?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra321","html_url":"https://github.com/rmahindra321","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra321/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra321/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra321/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra321/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra321/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra321/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra321/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra321/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra321/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.co

Hudi Team!\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nWe are using Deltastreamer to ingest events from kafka into an S3 store.\r\nWe had some incident this week after some of our producers switched to a new schema version, but some remained on older schem versions.\r\n\r\nWe stumbled over this PR https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2619. With the following settings we can enable the Custom avro kafka deserializer\r\n```\r\nhoodie.deltastreamer.source.kafka.value.deserializer.class=org.apache.hudi.utilities.deser.KafkaAvroSchemaDeserializer\r\nhoodie.deltastreamer.schemaprovider.class=org.apache.hudi.utilities.schema.FilebasedSchemaProvider\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoing so we noticed that KafkaAvroSchemaDeserializer tries instanciating the configured SchemaProvider via reflection. It calls the constructor in https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/cdb9b48170ef98634babd8954392efb1c1b90fcf/hudi-utilities/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/utilities/deser/KafkaAvroSchemaDeserializer.java#L55 resulting in\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: org.apache.hudi.utilities.schema.SchemaProviderWithPostProcessor.<init>(org.apache.hudi.common.config.TypedProperties)\r\n```\r\nThere are multiple problems here\r\n* The Class has not the needed constructor\r\n* As we are using FilebasedSchemaProvider it calls the wrong class wrapping the FilebasedSchemaProvider\r\n* The FilebasedSchemaProvider needs the JavaSparkContext to work correctly. I think we dont have access to the JavaSparkContext in KafkaAvroSchemaDeserializer\r\n* In the master branch we don't pass any \"hoodie.*\" Setting to the Kafka client (change since 0.8.0 in https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2754) so either we rename the settings to not start with hoodie or we pass them to Kafka client. In the master branch the feature is currently broken.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the KafkaAvroSchemaDeserializer, so that it does not rely on Reflection to call the SchemaProvider.\r\nInstead it uses the normal progam flow to ask the SchemaProvider for the sourceSchema.\r\nIt then passes the sourceSchema as Property to the KafkaAvroSchemaDeserializer so that it can be used for deserialization.\r\nAlso we pass all \"hoodie.deltastreamer.source.kafka.value.deserializer.*\" properties to the Kafka client\r\n\r\nAnyway: I wonder if it is a good idea to make the usage of KafkaAvroSchemaDeserializer the default. IMHO it woud make sense.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\nYou have to enable the feature with\r\n```\r\nhoodie.deltastreamer.source.kafka.value.deserializer.class=org.apache.hudi.utilities.deser.KafkaAvroSchemaDeserializer\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAttempt to fix `TestHoodieDeltaStreamer.testUpsertsMORContinuousModeWithMultipleWriters` flaky test.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nSometimes, the pending compaction timeline has not yet been updated and there is no compaction request. The assertion for \"at least N compaction commits\" keeps failing until the deltaStreamerTestRunner times out. This diff increases the timeout from 4 minutes to 6 miuntes to workaround the issue.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, I ran the test 20 times and it failed thrice. I did the same after this change and it always passed. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing test (TestHoodieDeltaStreamer).\r\n\r\n## Committer

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nTicket - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1996\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this pull request is to allow connectivity with confluent schema registries that require basic authentication (which confluent cloud requires). It does this by allowing the user to provide username and password in the `hoodie.deltastreamer.schemaprovider.registry.baseUrl` so that it is available to the `SchemaRegistryProvider` and by upgrading the version of the io.confluent schema registry libs that are bundled up with hudi as the current ones included do not support basic auth. Despite this issue https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/1925 being closed the error still persists due to a JDK described here https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-5043482.  This is pretty high priority for us as without these changes using hudi with confluent cloud is pretty much impossible without custom code changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Bumping io.confluent libs bundled to support basic auth with schema registry.*\r\n  - *Allowing the passing of basic auth in url for hudi `SchemaRegistryProvider`*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - This PR includes unit test for the changes made in the file .\r\n  - Regression tests covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of the

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nRegistry.add() API adds the new value to existing metric value. For some use-cases We need a API to set/replace the existing value.\r\n\r\nMetadata Table is synced in preWrite() and postWrite() functions of commit. As part of the sync, the current sizes and basefile/logfile counts are published as metrics. If we use the Registry.add() API, the count and sizes are incorrectly published as sum of the two values. This is corrected by using the Registry.set() API instead.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nNew API introduced - Registry.set()\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nMetadata Table cannot be bootstrapped when any action is in progress. This is detected by the presence of inflight or requested instants. The bootsrapping is initiated in preWrite and postWrite of each commit. So bootstrapping will be retried again until it succeeds.\r\n\r\nAlso added metrics for when the bootstrapping fails or a table is re-bootstrapped. This will help detect tables which are not getting bootstrapped.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nDetect any non-complete operation on the dataset. If found, do not start the bootstrap of metadata table.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n  - Added / updated tests in TestHoodieBackedMetadata\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAddressing [HUDI-1932](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1932); only update the last commit timestamp on the Hive table when the table schema has changed or a partition is created/updated.\r\n\r\nWhen using AWS Glue Data Catalog as the metastore for Hive this will ensure that table versions are substantive (including schema and/or partition changes). Prior to this change when a Hive sync is performed without schema or partition changes the table in the Glue Data Catalog would have a new version published with the only change being the timestamp property.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Update Hive table's `last_commit_time_sync` property only when the table schema or a partition has changed\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added `TestHiveSyncTool#testSyncWithoutDiffs` unit test to verify the change.\r\n- Verified existing tests in `TestHiveSyncTool` remained passing.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1932)\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella
