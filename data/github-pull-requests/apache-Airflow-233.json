However I have not heard of any success stories of trying to use Breeze on WSL 1, I am therefore proposing we replace the WSL 1 section with a WSL 2 section seems to work almost instantly.

(please include exact error messages if you can) -->\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nI am able to create a service with Docker swarm operator but I can not mount a volume to the container. I understand the problem when I run \"docker service inspect <service_name>\", there is no volume mounted to the host PC. \r\n\r\n**Solution proposal**:\r\nInside _run_image() function in docker_swarm.py file we create a service but it has a missing argument for the volumes.\r\nI simply fixed the problem when I add `mounts=self.volumes` as an argument to a `ContainerSpec` function.\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Unit tests coverage for changes (not needed for

the spark submit hook's `on_kill` is called, it tries to kill the yarn app, but doesn't do a kinit even if the keytab and principal is supplied. This would mean that the `yarn applicaition -kill <app id>` will  fail when yarn needs kerberos authentication, and the app will continue to run. \r\n\r\nThis change tries to do an explicit `kinit`

is a mismatch between return value of job_completion of AwsGlueJobHook and end condition in poke of AwsGlueJobSensor. While job_completion returns a dictionary of JobRunState and JobRunId, poke checks if it is 'SUCCEEDED' or 'FAILED' which should be only JobRunState. So the condition always fails and poke always returns False which leads GlueSensor to run indefinitely even if Glue job finished.\r\nAlso, I think while loop in job_completion is useless. It should return immediately after it gets response from glue client but doesn't have to wait until it finishes or fails. It is duplicated with execution loop of Sensor.\r\n\r\nCloses: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/9021\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x]

of the main advantages of using AWS Secrets Manager is its ability to automatically create secrets of RDS databases and Redshift databases. Those secrets consist of several keys with their values, i.e user, pass, etc. Also, it is normal to store API Keys, sftp, or whatever using different values, as shown in the picture below:\r\n![Captura de pantalla 2020-05-22 a las 10 41 07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11339132/82648933-c23ac100-9c18-11ea-9f7c-6a36d0333bbe.png)\r\n\r\nWith the current code, all the keys and values obtained from a secret are stored in the schema attribute of the conn object, unless you have just one key with the conn_uri in the value. Thus, the current situation is forcing to use Secrets Manager in a way it is not intended to.\r\n\r\nWith this proposed modification, you can use AWS Secrets Manager using keys and values and have some kind of freedom to choose different words for each key to make the get_conn work.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides

of the main advantages of using AWS Secrets Manager is its ability to automatically create secrets of RDS databases and Redshift databases. Those secrets consist of several keys with their values, i.e user, pass, etc. Also, it is normal to store API Keys, sftp, or whatever using different values, as shown in the picture below:\r\n![Captura de pantalla 2020-05-22 a las 10 41 07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11339132/82648933-c23ac100-9c18-11ea-9f7c-6a36d0333bbe.png)\r\n\r\nWith the current code, all the keys and values obtained from a secret are stored in the schema attribute of the conn object, unless you have just one key with the conn_uri in the value. Thus, the current situation is forcing to use Secrets Manager in a way it is not intended to.\r\n\r\nWith this proposed modification, you can use AWS Secrets Manager using keys and values and have some kind of freedom to choose different words for each key to make the get_conn work.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides

my first time working with an open source project and I posting here the first attempt for an ML operator guide. It is still in progress now, but some feedback is always welcome.\r\n\r\n# Guide for ML operator (Work in progress)\r\n\r\n## AI Platform:\r\n- The [AI Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/docs/technical-overview) is used to train your machine learning models at scale, to host your trained model in the cloud, and to use your model to make predictions about new data.\r\n\r\n- Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI). The goal of ML is to make computers learn from the data that you give them. Instead of writing code that describes the action the computer should take, your code provides an algorithm that adapts based on examples of intended behavior. The resulting program, consisting of the algorithm and associated learned parameters, is called a trained model.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Prerequisite Tasks\r\n\r\nTo use these operators, you must do a few things:\r\n\r\n- Select or create a Cloud Platform project using [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager).\r\n- Enable billing for your project, as described in [Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project).\r\n- Enable API, as described in [Cloud Console documentation](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/getting-started).\r\n- Install API libraries via pip.\r\n\r\n> pip install 'apache-airflow[gcp]'\r\n\r\nDetailed information is available [Installation](https://airflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)\r\n- Setup [connection](https://airflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/connection/gcp.html).\r\n\r\n# Service description:\r\n\r\n## AI Platform:\r\n- The AI Platform is used to train your machine learning models at scale, to host your trained model in the cloud, and to use your model to make predictions about new data.\r\n\r\n- Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI). The goal of ML is to make computers learn from the data that you give them. Instead of writing code that describes the action the computer should take, your code provides an algorithm that adapts based on examples of intended behavior. The resulting program, consisting of the algorithm and associated learned parameters, is called a trained model.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Operators\r\n\r\n- You will need to set up a Python dictionary containing all the arguments applied to all the tasks in your workflow by using default_args.\r\n- start_date = determines the execution day of the first DAG task instant\r\n- params = a dictionary of DAG level parameters that are made accessible in templates, namespaced under params. These params can be overridden at the task level.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndefault_args = {\r\n    \"start_date\": days_ago(1),\r\n    \"params\": {\r\n        \"model_name\": MODEL_NAME\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### MLEngineManageModelOperator\r\n- Use the **MLEngineManageModelOperator** to create a ML model. The task_id refers to name of task (creating a model in this case). It's basically a description of what your task does. Project_id refers to the name you have given your project, model_name refers to the name you have given your model.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n create_model = MLEngineManageModelOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"create-model\",\r\n        project_id=PROJECT_ID,\r\n        operation='create',\r\n        model={\r\n            \"name\": MODEL_NAME,\r\n        },\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\n### MLEngineCreateVersionOperator\r\n\r\n- With the **MLEngineCreateVersionOperator** a version can be created of a operator. The task_id is a unique, meaningful id for the task, project_id is  a the name of the project it refers too, model_name refers to the name of your model, version contains information you have giving to this version of operator. (Do I need to explain the arguments in version? I don't see this in other examples.)\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate_version = MLEngineCreateVersionOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"create-version\",\r\n        project_id=PROJECT_ID,\r\n        model_name=MODEL_NAME,\r\n        version={\r\n            \"name\": \"v1\",\r\n            \"description\": \"First-version\",\r\n            \"deployment_uri\": '{}/keras_export/'.format(JOB_DIR),\r\n            \"runtime_version\": \"1.14\",\r\n            \"machineType\": \"mls1-c1-m2\",\r\n            \"framework\": \"TENSORFLOW\",\r\n            \"pythonVersion\": \"3.5\"\r\n        }\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### MLEngineDeleteVersionOperator\r\n- Use the **MLEngineDeleteVersionOperator** to delete a version of your ML model. The task_id refers to what your task does (it's just name), project_id refers to the name you have given your project, model_name refers to the name you have given your model, version_name refers to which version of a model you want to delete.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndelete_version = MLEngineDeleteVersionOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"delete-version\",\r\n        project_id=PROJECT_ID,\r\n        model_name=MODEL_NAME,\r\n        version_name=\"v1\"\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n### MLEngineDeleteModelOperator\r\n- The **MLEngineDeleteModelOperator** deletes your whole ML model. The task_id is the a descriptive name given to a task, project_id refers to the name you have given your project, model_name refers to the name you have given your model, delete_contents when set on True is will delete eveything within your ML model (model_name).\r\n\r\n```\r\ndelete_model = MLEngineDeleteModelOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"delete-model\",\r\n        project_id=PROJECT_ID,\r\n        model_name=MODEL_NAME,\r\n        delete_contents=True\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [ ] Description above provides

\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nI am using airflow SparkSubmitOperator to schedule my spark jobs on kubernetes cluster. \r\n\r\nBut for some reason, kubernetes often throw 'too old resource version' exception which will interrupt spark watcher, then airflow will lost the log stream and could not get 'Exit Code' eventually. So airflow will mark job failed once log stream lost but the job is still running.\r\n\r\nThis is  a solution about an simple retry mechanism which is when the log stream is interrupted, then airflow try to get 'Exit Code' by 'kubectl describe pod xxxx-driver ' command.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n## update\r\nThere is no method like cmd 'describe pod ' in kubernetes python client api, so call 'read_namespaced_pod()' to get spark driver pod status instead.\r\n\r\n## Target Github ISSUE\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/8963\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below

[AIP-31](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-31:+Airflow+functional+DAG+definition) task decorator implementation. This decorator should facilitate wrapping a function into an operator and use it as such in a DAG. Closes #8057. Closes #8056.\r\n\r\n- Should be used without args or with args/kwargs for the underlying operator:\r\n```\r\n@task\r\ndef simple_task(...):\r\n\r\n@operator(dag=dag)\r\ndef simple_task(...):\r\n```\r\n- Task ID should be the function name by default.\r\n- Decorator should return an instance of `PythonFunctionalOperator`. This can be used to set task dependencies. Ex:\r\n```\r\n@task \r\ndef simple_task(...)\r\n  pass\r\n\r\nsimple_task >> another_task\r\n```\r\n- Adding documentation on `@task` and functional style dags in concepts.rst\r\n\r\nWork done in collaboration from @turbaszek and @evgenyshulman \r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Unit

proposed change modifies the tooltip on the Tree View to include \"Next Execution Date\". I've found that Airflow scheduling work at the end of a schedule interval is a common source of confusion for my users. When they see on the tree view that the \"last run\" was one schedule interval away from the current time, they often raise questions about why the latest run hasn't kicked off yet.\r\n\r\nI believe that showing both execution date and next execution date in this tooltip better illustrates the window of time that their Airflow task is operating on.\r\n\r\n![airflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7297387/82514204-bea12000-9ada-11ea-8569-7f0236f0c897.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR:
