Description ##\r\nThis PR introduces enhanced Python and C APIs to trigger graph partitioning for a given backend. These APIs provide an option to the user to infer shapes, dtypes and stypes before partitioning. They add the ability to pass optional arguments to subgraph property.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the following modifications to subgraph property:\r\n- Added the ability for the subgraph property to preprocess the graph and initialize any custom state that is required during partitioning\r\n- Added the ability for the subgraph property to post-process the graph and do things like collect statistics on the quality of partitioning.\r\n- Enabled subgraph property to reject creating a sub-optimal subgraph. For example, the subgraph property could reject subgraphs with only one operator in it.\r\n\r\nWe reuse the existing graph partitioning algorithm and control using subgraph property classes. Since we’re modifying a symbol object, we add this API to the Symbol class. Users will call `optimize_for` on an existing symbol object to create a new partitioned symbol.\r\n\r\nHere is an example showing partitioning without args, which means infer shape/type will NOT be called before partitioning.  It is similar to `GetBackendSymbol`.\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nsym, args, aux = mx.model.load_checkpoint('resnet-50', 0)\r\nsym = sym.optimize_for('default')\r\nexe = sym.bind(ctx=mx.cpu(), args=args, aux_states=aux, grad_req='null')\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is an example showing partitioning with args, which means infer shape/type is called before partitioning.\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nsym, args, aux = mx.model.load_checkpoint('resnet-50', 0)\r\nsym = sym.optimize_for('default', args=args, ctx=mx.cpu())\r\nexe = sym.bind(ctx=mx.cpu(), args=args, aux_states=aux, grad_req='null')\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is an example showing partitioning with kwargs to set a list of ops to be excluded from subgraphs.\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nsym, args, aux = mx.model.load_checkpoint('resnet-50', 0)\r\nsym = sym.optimize_for('default', args=args, ctx=mx.cpu(), excluded_ops=['BatchNorm'])\r\nexe = sym.bind(ctx=mx.cpu(), args=args, aux_states=aux, grad_req='null')\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext steps:\r\n- Add example(s) and test(s) for `excluded_ops` passed as arguments to `optimize_for` as part of the PR on support for custom subgraph properties\r\n- Add functionality for users to pass shape/type/stype dicts as kwargs to `optimize_for` just like we have it in `simple_bind`\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change","created_at":"2019-08-14T01:55:34Z","updated_at":"2020-06-01T10:47:27Z","closed_at":"2019-09-03T00:37:43Z","merged_at":"2019-09-03T00:37:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"692f3c45238a055b2348ddc90ad6b8b9f3e857de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Building+the+New+Website\r\n\r\n**Break out each docs package generation to separate pipelines.**\r\n  ✅Python - porting the mx-theme to be local to the repo to facilitate modification as part of this project's PRs; this is from the \"beta site\"\r\n  ✅R - using the same theme as Python; also from the \"beta site\"; found to be not reproducible or current, so disabled for now.\r\n  ✅C/CPP - currently co-mingled Doxygen microsite output\r\n  ✅Julia - julia docs output to microsite\r\n  ✅Scala - scaladocs output to microsite\r\n  ✅Java - javadocs output to microsite\r\n  ✅Clojure - lein output to microsite\r\n  ✅Jekyll website for main pages \r\n\r\nLegend:\r\n✅Artifacts generating in CI\r\n❌WIP\r\n\r\n## Jenkins Updates\r\n* [New docs folder pipelines to generate artifacts for each docs package](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/docs-pipelines/) - also has an MXNet binary build pipeline that can be used to share the latest binary as an archived artifact.\r\n* [Publish job](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/test-website-publish/) - takes artifacts from the docs pipelines, collates the website and publishes it to incubator-mxnet-site.\r\n  * using the last successful build URLs for each pipeline assures that the website gets published even if one docs package is failing\r\n* Dockerfile updates - to speed up testing, each docs package has a custom dockerfile that only installs dependencies required for that specific package rather than installing everything (as is done now).\r\n* New Python and R sites use Conda, so miniconda Python deps are installed with conda now.\r\n* New support for Jekyll: Docker container and related runtime functions\r\n\r\n## Preview\r\nThe publishing job uses CI artifacts generated from my fork of mxnet and pushes to my fork of mxnet-site, and you can see the output on a dev server here:\r\nhttp://54.211.76.74/\r\n\r\n## TODO when this PR is approved\r\n\r\n* Add notifications for when docs package builds fail.\r\n* Convert test pipelines to production website deployment flows.\r\n* Upload old version artifacts.\r\n* New PR triggering of a website test\r\n* Switch to GPU builds for the Python docs, so the outputs are in the tutorials\r\n\r\n## Comments\r\n* Stash operations vs. archiving - recommendations in the docs suggest that large artifacts should be archived; stash is super slow; archived artifacts seems to be faster and can be used between pipelines. This is helpful for the MXNet binary and for the Scala package, both of which are used by various other docs packages. However, there's an implication with the master server. Archived artifacts are stored there, so if the pipeline is related to PR validation, this would be unwieldy. If related to publishing final artifacts for specific versions, well, that's probably ok.\r\n* It seems that efficiency in development and testing can be gained by checkpointing the docker containers after the dependencies are installed.\r\n* A version/branch parameter would be useful for the Jenkins pipelines for generating docs artifacts from different branches.\r\n* Publishing scripts seem to need a security refactor, or we don't bother offering stand-alone access to them; running local versus on Jenkins.\r\n* A bug bash is needed on the new Python docs - I turned off \"warnings as

Description ##\r\n'Out of heap space' errors having been plaguing our Windows CI builds for some time (https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/13958).  The errors appear to be a result of the limited virtual memory of the 32-bit version of cl.exe being used.  After some trial and error (due to not having direct access to the build machines) this PR upgrades the Windows compilation toolchain to 64-bit programs.  The PR leaves the compiler version at VS2015.  A VS2017 compiler appears to be installed onto the CI machines but cannot be used yet because compatible OpenCV libraries are not present.\r\n\r\nI recommend a quick review due to the inconvenience of having these sporadic build failures.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nAdded a flag to run benchmark using either MXNet's default profiler (built-in Cpp profiler) or Python's time module\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nSignatures of few functions changes.\r\nHowever, changes are backward compatible\r\n\r\n### Note ###\r\nWhile MXNet's built-in profiler (CPP profiler) dumps separate information about forward and backward pass\r\nWith respect to Python's time module, it currently is not feasible to calculate on that level.\r\nRight now, python time module is used to calculate average of total time taken for 1 run of operator.\r\n\r\nHence, output of cpp profiler is `avg_time_forward_opname` while output of python profiler is `avg_time_opname`\r\n\r\nBy default, \r\nIn case of opperf.py (running for all operators)\r\nif the operator has backward, then backward call is profiled along with forward\r\n\r\n## Test ##\r\nVerified the code doesn't break using following commands\r\n### 1. All Operators\r\n#### Positive tests\r\n##### Original (without flag)\r\n```\r\npython benchmark/opperf/opperf.py --output-format json --output-file mx_test.json\r\n```\r\n##### New (With flag)\r\nFor python\r\n```\r\npython benchmark/opperf/opperf.py -p python --output-format json --output-file mx_test.json\r\n```\r\nFor cpp\r\n```\r\npython benchmark/opperf/opperf.py -p cpp --output-format json --output-file mx_test.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Negative tests\r\n```\r\npython benchmark/opperf/opperf.py -p abc --output-format json --output-file mx_test.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Per operator category\r\n#### Positive tests\r\n##### Original (without flag)\r\n```\r\nfrom benchmark.opperf.nd_operations.reduction_operators import run_mx_reduction_operators_benchmarks\r\nrun_mx_reduction_operators_benchmarks()\r\n```\r\n##### New (With flag)\r\nFor python\r\n```\r\nfrom benchmark.opperf.nd_operations.reduction_operators import run_mx_reduction_operators_benchmarks\r\nrun_mx_reduction_operators_benchmarks(profiler=\"python\")\r\n```\r\nFor cpp\r\n```\r\nfrom benchmark.opperf.nd_operations.reduction_operators import run_mx_reduction_operators_benchmarks\r\nrun_mx_reduction_operators_benchmarks(profiler=\"cpp\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Negative tests\r\n```\r\nfrom benchmark.opperf.nd_operations.reduction_operators import run_mx_reduction_operators_benchmarks\r\nrun_mx_reduction_operators_benchmarks(profiler=\"p\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3.

Description ##\r\nAdded the sub/mul operators to the MXnet -> ONNX conversion, for usage in the ONNX -> tensorRT conversion.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Added ConvertElementwiseSub in nnvm_to_onnx-inl.h / nnvm_to_onnx.cc\r\n- [x] Added ConvertElementwiseMul in nnvm_to_onnx-inl.h / nnvm_to_onnx.cc\r\n- [x] Minor: fixed typo in CMakelists\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- The implementation directly follows ConvertElementwiseAdd.\r\n- Fixes a bug since these missing operators were registered as TRTcompatible even before this

Description ##\r\nMXNet's reshape operator expects the shape to be a static tuple. In some models, the shape attribute is decided based on the output of the previous layer. Example, https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10789. Adding support for allowing a tensor for the target shape in Reshape.\r\n\r\nBased on https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14393\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nNumpy compatible dstack with existing kernel from concat\r\n[Numpy dstack](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.dstack.html)\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes \r\n- Shape Inference added in src/operator/numpy/np_matrix_op.cc\r\n- Forward and Backward compute in src/operator/nn/concat-in.h\r\n- CPU and GPU registration in src/operator/numpy/np_matrix_op.cc and src/operator/numpy/np_matrix_op.cu\r\nPass CPU/GPU and lint tests.\r\n\r\n#### Test Case Covered\r\n- scalar tensor\r\n- zero size tensor\r\n-

Description ##\r\nPopulating static variable in `__init__()` overwrites the cache every time thus defeating the purpose of the cache. Therefore populating cache in `__new__()` where it is checked whether instance is populated or not.

Description ##\r\n- add numpy compatible [invert](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.invert.html) \r\n- add a helper function for checking if input or output is integer\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- add invert and its test\r\n- a helper function to check for checking if input and output is of type integer at ` src/operator/operator_common.h

Description ##\r\nCurrent `mx.np.random.uniform` does not support parameters (low and high) as `Ndarray`, as the current version is implemented by wrapping `mxnet.ndarray.random.uniform`, which behaves in a different way **when the output shape is given by the user** compared with native Numpy. \r\nFor example: \r\n```\r\nlow = np.zeros((1,4))\r\nhigh = np.ones((1,4))\r\nshape = (2,4,4)\r\n```\r\n`mxnet.ndarray.random.uniform(low, high, shape)`  would have output tensor of shape 1x4x2x4x4, however, result from `numpy.random.uniform(low, high, shape)` would have shape 2x4x4.\r\n\r\nAnother major difference is that,  numpy allows parameters to have different shapes as long as they are broadcastable.\r\nFor example: \r\n```\r\nlow = np.zeros((1,4))\r\nhigh = np.ones((4,4))\r\nshape = (2,4,4)\r\n```\r\nThis setting would cause `Operator _sample_uniform inferring shapes failed.` with `mxnet.ndarray.random.uniform`.\r\n\r\nThis pull request implements a uniform distribution generator with numpy behavior and GPU support.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] New backend for random.uniform (np_uniform_op.*) implemented.\r\n- [x] Current np.random.uniform() in python frontend is renamed to __deprecated_uniform().\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- When both low and high are python scalars and `size` is not defined, a scalar tensor would be returned. This is different from native Numpy, which would return python scalar if both parameters are python scalar.\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\n>>>numpy.random.uniform()\r\n0.1234\r\n>>>mxnet.np.random.uniform()\r\narray(0.1234)\r\n```","created_at":"2019-08-12T09:09:45Z","updated_at":"2019-08-21T21:53:49Z","closed_at":"2019-08-21T21:53:49Z","merged_at":"2019-08-21T21:53:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"521e925b8c9417532667bcd97cfa9aac664056b4","assignee":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"reminisce","id":4978794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzg3OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4978794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce","html_url":"https://github.com/reminisce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15858/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15858/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/15858/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/d02f0d7c0604940dab4e78f24e426e946eeb0071","head":{"label":"xidulu:master_numpy_uniform_dev","ref":"master_numpy_uniform_dev","sha":"d02f0d7c0604940dab4e78f24e426e946eeb0071","user":{"login":"xidulu","id":26022201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDIyMjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26022201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu","html_url":"https://github.com/xidulu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":195962165,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTU5NjIxNjU=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"xi

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- add stack internal interface\r\n- add python interface\r\n- add unit tests\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThank @reminisce @haojin2 for guidance and

Description ##\r\nThis PR indents to rebase the feature branch to the latest master to mitigate the discrepancy of the two branches, especially there are some fixes for flaky tests on the master branch which will also save the CI on this feature branch.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\nWhile trying to track down rnn test flakiness that surfaced in PR#15741, I noticed that the CI for the unix-gpu runners is running against cudnn 7.5, while the libmxnet.so was built against 7.6.  This PR is an attempt to see if the flakiness is correlated with the cudnn lib version.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n-

Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

$JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

(i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a register_op_hook for Block. One can register_op_hook to monitor all the ops that are called by the HybridBlock after hybridization. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef mon_callback(node_name, opr_name, arr):\r\n      print(py_str(node_name))\r\n      print(py_str(opr_name))\r\nmodel = mx.gluon.nn.HybridSequential(prefix=\"dense_\")\r\nwith model.name_scope():\r\n     model.add(mx.gluon.nn.Dense(2))\r\nmodel.initialize()\r\nmodel.hybridize()\r\nmodel.register_op_hook(mon_callback, monitor_all=True)\r\nmodel(mx.nd.ones((2, 3, 4)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will print the following : \r\n```\r\ndense_dense0_fwd_data\r\nFullyConnected\r\ndense_dense0_fwd_weight\r\nFullyConnected\r\ndense_dense0_fwd_bias\r\nFullyConnected\r\ndense_dense0_fwd_output\r\nFullyConnected\r\n```\r\n\r\nSetting monitor_all=False will print only the output : \r\n```\r\ndense_dense0_fwd_output\r\nFullyConnected\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is not supported ###\r\n\r\n1. register_op_hook on non hybridized blocks is not supported. If a block is not a hybrid block and register_op_hook is called on it, it will be registered only on HybridBlocks which are children of the blocks. The callback will only be invoked after hybridization.\r\n2. Calback is not supported when static_shape=True for call to hybridize.\r\n\r\ncc @Vikas-kum \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny

operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

(i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Testing ##\r\nubuntu@ip-172-31-82-110 ~/incubator-mxnet (singleton_feature) $ MXNET_TEST_COUNT=1 nosetests --logging-level=DEBUG --verbose -s

Use of monitors (for debugging) requires these input counts to be equal.\r\n\r\nThis PR supplies the check of expected vs. actual node input counts and exposes the fact that many operators have a discrepancy.  As suggested by @ptrendx, this check is best supplied in this separate PR, as it might take some time to fix all the non-compliant operators.  The first commit only supplies the check, not operator fixes, and so is expected to fail.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not

$JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\nOps Supported: Slice\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\n\r\nAdded backward type inference support for _rnn_param_concat.\r\nfixes: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/15716\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nImplementation of numpy `identity` operator in mxnet.\r\nThe version that cherry-pick on new numpy branch, old pr -> #15698.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best

Description ##\r\nBackground: Now that MXNet 1.5 no longer compiles against cuDNN v6 and earlier, any cuDNN code that special-cases those earlier versions is needlessly cluttering the codebase.  PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15449 introduced the STATIC_ASSERT_CUDNN_VERSION_GE() macro as a way to document and enforce the requirements of the codebase locally in the files that create those dependencies.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes code that needlessly adapts operators to cuDNN v6 (and earlier) APIs and uses  STATIC_ASSERT_CUDNN_VERSION_GE() to enforce the restriction to operate only against cuDNN v7 and later.  This cleanup helps create a concise and understandable codebase able to accept further feature improvements.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description\r\nThis PR adds the option to specify different scales for different dimensions. \r\n\r\nRef: [#12602](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/12602)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n### Essentials\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes).\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR).\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator).\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore).\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL).\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented:\r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated.\r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented.\r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable.\r\n- Check the API doc at [http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html](http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html)\r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Change scale to tuple\r\n- Add custom nearest neighbor implementation\r\n- Allow same scales for bilinear upsampling\r\n\r\n## Comments\r\n- ONNX import/export for Upsampling operator is added in @vandanavk's PR [#15994](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15994)\r\n- Fix for bilinear upsampling documentation and test are at [#14305](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14035)\r\n- Performance of this operator was tested against the original implementation using a simple test [script](https://github.com/huangzhiyuan/vgg-fpn/blob/master/test/test.py) from @huangzhiyuan--the results of the test on my machine were as follows:\r\n\r\n| **OP** | **scale** | **time cost (s)** | **s/call** | **calls** |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Upsampling (origin) | 2 | 3.763051 | 0.037630 | 100 |\r\n| Upsampling (with this fix) | 2 | 3.741265 | 0.037413 | 100 |\r\n| Upsampling (with this fix) | (2, 3) | 5.613855 | 0.056139 | 100 |\r\n\r\n- Currently does not support floating point values for the scales, but can be added in the

The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nNumpy op `fmax` implementation using tvm.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- add `fmax`\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThanks for

Description ##\r\nAdd numpy compatible slicing operator under npx namespace\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- generally similar behavior as ndarray.slice\r\n- like numpy slicing, we allow the starting index to be greater than ending index, in which case a zero size tensor is generated \r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThank @haojin2 and @reminisce for

Description ##\r\nDifferentiable [svd](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.svd.html)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- add np.linalg.svd\r\n- add forward and backward tests\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThank @reminisce and @haojin2 for review and

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nAdded 11 binary arithmetic operators - `add`, `sub`, `rsub`, `neg`, `mul`, `div`, `rdiv`, `mod`, `rmod`, `imod`, `pow`\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Design choice\r\n### Choice of operator to call\r\nI had a choice between\r\n`__op__` vs `op_symbol` vs `mx.nd.op`\r\n\r\nSince `x.__add__(y) <=> x+y <=> mx.nd.add(x, y)`\r\n\r\nHowever, due to cases like these\r\n\r\nmod : `x.__mod__(y) <=> x%y <=> mx.nd.modulo(x, y)`\r\nrmod: `x.__rmod__(y) <=> y%x <=> mx.nd.modulo(y, x)`\r\n\r\n_I chose to stick with the `__op__` so that the function is consistent._\r\n\r\n### Choice 2\r\nI chose to have separate functions because \r\na. Easier to debug & test separate operators\r\nb. No 100% 1-to-1 correlation\r\nDivide ops are different\r\n`__div__` in MXNet vs `__truediv__`\r\n\r\n### create_2d_tensor vs nd.ones\r\n_Chose nd.ones due to performance reasons._\r\nAfter monitoring multiple runs of test_large_array\r\nUpon running the entire file, it would crash due to lack of memory error.\r\n480Gig machine (dedicated for this one task) - p3.16xl\r\n\r\nReworked the code to ensure\r\na. variables are reused\r\nb. in-house MXNet function (`mx.nd.ones`) used over the previous method (`create_2d_tensor` uses combination of functions from numpy and mxnet)\r\nc. arange is not really needed to test if the function works for large

this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\n\r\nDuring numerical grad, the output symbol is multiplied by a random matrix. This increases the numerical errors dramatically. With this change, the gradient is still checked at the right location, but without the reduced precission. The benefit by adding a constant instead of multiplying is also that the gradient output in symbolic is always the same and the numerical one changes very little.\r\n\r\nFixes #11720\r\nOverall will reduce flakiness of tests using numerical gradients\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc

Description ##\r\nUpdated the pre-requisite section to reflect that \r\nFrom 1.5.1 onwards, one would no longer need to build the MXNet from source for using opperf utility.\r\nCurrently, 1.5.0 is latest on pip package. For 1.5.1, 1.6.0 one would have to install nightly build.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e.
