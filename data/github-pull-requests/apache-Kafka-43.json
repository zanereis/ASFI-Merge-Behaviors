files are used by Kafka to identify log directories within the filesystem.\r\nPreviously, the code for handling them was in BrokerMetadataCheckpoint.scala. This PR rewrites the\r\ncode for handling them as Java and moves it to the apache.kafka.metadata.properties namespace. It\r\nalso gets rid of the separate types for v0 and v1 meta.properties objects. Having separate types\r\nwasn't so bad back when we had a strict rule that zk clusters used v0 and kraft clusters used v1.\r\nBut ZK migration has blurred the lines. Now, a zk cluster may have either v0 or v1, if it is\r\nmigrating, and a kraft cluster may have either v0 or v1, at any time.\r\n\r\nThe new code distinguishes between an individual meta.properties file, which is represented by\r\nMetaProperties, and a collection of meta.properties files, which is represented by\r\nMetaPropertiesEnsemble. It is useful to have this distinction, because in JBOD mode, even if some\r\nlog directories are inaccessible, we can still use the ensemble to extract needed information like\r\nthe cluster ID. (Of course, even when not in JBOD mode, KRaft servers have always been able to\r\nconfigure a metadata log directory separate from the main log directory.)\r\n\r\nSince we recently added a unique directory.id to each meta.properties file, the previous convention\r\nof passing a \"canonical\" MetaProperties object for the cluster around to various places in the code\r\nneeds to be revisited. After all, we can no longer assume all of the meta.properties files are the\r\nsame. This PR fixes these parts of the code. For example, it fixes the constructors of\r\nControllerApis and RaftManager to just take a cluster ID, rather than a MetaProperties object. It\r\nfixes some other parts of the code, like the constructor of SharedServer, to take a\r\nMetaPropertiesEnsemble object.\r\n\r\nAnother goal of this PR was to centralize meta.properties validation a bit more and make it\r\nunit-testable.

`KafkaApis.scala`, we build the API response differently if exceptions are thrown during the API execution. Since the new group coordinator only populates the response with error code instead of throwing an exception when an error occurs, there may be different behavior between the existing group coordinator and the new one.\r\n\r\nThis pr\r\n- Fixes the response building in `KafkaApis.scala` for the two APIs affected by such difference -- OffsetFetch and OffsetDelete.\r\n- In `GroupCoordinatorService.java`, returns a response with error code instead of a failed future when the coordinator is not active.\r\n\r\n###

the `syncGroupOffset` method, if `targetConsumerOffset.get(topicPartition)` gets null, then the calculation of `latestDownstreamOffset` will throw NPE. This usually occurs in this situation: a group consumed a topic in the target cluster previously. Later, the group offset of some partitions was reset to -1, the `OffsetAndMetadata` of these partitions was null.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that when reset offsets are performed in the java kafka client, the reset to -1 will be intercepted. However, there are some other types of clients such as sarama, which can magically reset the group offset to -1, so MM2 will trigger an NPE exception in this scenario. Therefore, a defensive measure to avoid NPE is needed

Fixed some of the failing tests in FetchRequestTest. \r\n\r\n  `testFetchWithPartitionsWithIdError` and `testCreateIncrementalFetchWithPartitionsInErrorV12` fail with the following error when enabled with KRaft mode. These tests only fail sometimes when running locally but consistently failed when running in the Jenkins Pipeline. \r\n  ```\r\n  expected: <0> but was: <6>\r\n  Expected :0\r\n  Actual   :6\r\n  <Click to see difference>\r\n  \r\n  org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: <0> but was: <6>\r\n\t  at app//org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertionFailureBuilder.build(AssertionFailureBuilder.java:151)\r\n\t  at app//org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertionFailureBuilder.buildAndThrow(AssertionFailureBuilder.java:132)\r\n\t  at app//org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertEquals.failNotEqual(AssertEquals.java:197)\r\n\t  at app//org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertEquals.assertEquals(AssertEquals.java:134)\r\n\t  at app//org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertEquals.assertEquals(AssertEquals.java:129)\r\n\t  at app//org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals(Assertions.java:325)\r\n\t  at app//kafka.server.FetchRequestTest.testCreateIncrementalFetchWithPartitionsInErrorV12(FetchRequestTest.scala:547)\r\n  ...\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  The tests create topic partitions and send fetch requests for them. The expected error code to be returned is 0 however they get `NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER` exception.  We throw this exception when trying to read records from a log that doesn’t exist (https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/dc6a53e19606674bd1276bf05d3ae7a3a2115523/core/src/main/scala/kafka/cluster/Partition.scala#L504). The issue seems to be due to receiving fetch requests before logs being created on the broker.  The following test logs with extra debug lines show that we attempted to read records from the log for topic patition foo-1, a few milliseconds before it was created. \r\n  ```\r\n  [2023-10-18 12:44:18,200] DEBUG [Partition foo-1 broker=0] Getting log for topic with id foo-1 to read its records (kafka.cluster.Partition:62)\r\n  [2023-10-18 12:44:18,200] DEBUG [Partition foo-1 broker=0] NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER foo-1 because log is empty (kafka.cluster.Partition:62)\r\n  [2023-10-18 12:44:18,205] INFO Created log for partition foo-1 in /var/folders/fm/65mtddt52vjf8hycyj0rn64r0000gn/T/kafka-6502713585191291330/foo-1 with properties {} (kafka.log.LogManager:66)\r\n  [2023-10-18 12:44:18,212] DEBUG [KafkaApi-0] Fetch request with correlation id 1 from client client-id on partition AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA:foo-1 failed due to org.apache.kafka.common.errors.NotLeaderOrFollowerException (kafka.server.KafkaApis:62)\r\n  ```\r\n  In Zookeeper case, the log was created much earlier than attempting to read records from it therefore no error was returned for the fetch requests. \r\n  ```\r\n  [2023-10-18 12:38:31,252] INFO Created log for partition foo-1 in /var/folders/fm/65mtddt52vjf8hycyj0rn64r0000gn/T/kafka-1270567419648769103/foo-1 with properties {} (kafka.log.LogManager:66)\r\n  [2023-10-18 12:38:31,455] DEBUG [Partition foo-1 broker=0] Getting log for topic with id foo-1 to read its records (kafka.cluster.Partition:62)\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  The only difference between Zookeeper and KRaft mode in these tests is the way the topic partitions are created. In Zookeeper mode, we create the topic partitions directly with Zookeeper therefore seem to take less time to create the logs. In KRaft mode, we use Admin client to create topic partitions. Even though the test waits for topic partitions to get created and appear in metadata cache before sending fetch requests, it doesn’t seem to be sufficient time for the logs to be created on the brokers.  \r\n  \r\n  Tests will call the utility function `TestUtils.waitUntilLeaderIsKnown` after creating the topic partitions so that they wait for the logs to be created on the leader before sending fetch requests.\r\n\r\n- Enabled all tests except `checkLastFetchedEpochValidation` with KRaft mode.\r\n  Looking at the build history in Jenkins, all the other tests except these 2 tests and checkLastFetchedEpochValidation were passing when they were enabled with KRaft mode. Therefore enabled them with KRaft mode again but left `checkLastFetchedEpochValidation` to be investigated further. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

the current IQv2 code, there are noticeable differences when interfacing with plain-kv-store and ts-kv-store. Notably, the return type V acts as a simple value for plain-kv-store but evolves into ValueAndTimestamp<V> for ts-kv-store, which presents type safety issues in the API.\r\n\r\nEven if IQv2 hasn't gained widespread adoption, an immediate fix might bring compatibility concerns.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the essence of our proposal: the introduction of distinct query types. One that returns a plain value, another for values accompanied by timestamps.\r\n\r\nWhile querying a ts-kv-store for a plain value and then extracting it is feasible, it doesn't make sense to query a plain-kv-store for a ValueAndTimestamp<V>.\r\n\r\nOur vision is for plain-kv-store to always return V, while ts-kv-store should return ValueAndTimestamp<V>.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

off of https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13905, which itself appears to be based off of https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12358. The only changes applied here are the ones proposed during review of https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13905.\r\n\r\nThis PR tweaks how the `MirrorSourceTask` class interacts with its consumer on startup. With this change, instead of manually seeking to offset 0 when no committed offset for a topic partition is found, no seek is performed at all. This allows users to configure MM2 to begin replicating from the ends of topics (as opposed to the beginning, which is and remains the default behavior) by configuring its consumer with `auto.offset.reset` set to `latest`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-17T19:24:01Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T21:38:27Z","closed_at":"2023-12-04T21:37:38Z","merged_at":"2023-12-04T21:37:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"a83bc2d977d2af85d4edfc8096854137481001e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4511886370,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABDO3sIg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/mirror-maker-2","name":"mirror-maker-2","color":"1282B2","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14567/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14567/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/14567/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/f190c2de62347e86040b4d8398f8b8882f8fa393","head":{"label":"C0urante:kafka-13988","ref":"kafka-13988","sha":"f190c2de62347e86040b4d8398f8b8882f8fa393","user":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83460713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQ2MDcxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"C0urante/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante/kafka","description":"Mirror

Optimisation2: FetchResponse/ProduceResponse would return new leader info. This information is then used to update the Metadata cached.\r\n\r\nThis PR focuses on optimisation2 from above. Additionally it fixes a bug that got introduced to `MetadataCache.java`, details inline in a comment.\r\n\r\n**IGNORE** files - *.json, `FetchResponse.java` & `ProduceResponse.java`, they will be

app//kafka.server.FetchRequestTest.testLastFetchedEpochValidation(FetchRequestTest.scala:201)\r\n```\r\nThe test retrieves the leader epoch for a topic partition right after creating it. It then uses this epoch to set `lastFetchedEpoch` in the fetch request for offset greater than log end offset. When running KRaft mode, the test retrieves the leader epoch a few milliseconds before the leader epoch gets set on the broker and ends up retrieving value of `-1`. Sending fetch request with non valid/empty `lastFetchedEpoch` results in an attempt to read log which throws OFFSET_OUT_OF_RANGE exception if the offset is out of range (https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/LocalLog.scala#L400). The expected path is to return `LogReadInfo` [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/cluster/Partition.scala#L1461) without attempting to read the log therefore no exception. \r\n\r\nThe reason it takes longer to set the leader epoch in KRaft mode is because of the way the topic partitions are created differently than Zookeeper. In Zookeeper mode, we create the topic partitions directly with Zookeeper therefore seem to take less time to create the logs and set leader epoch on broker. In KRaft mode, we use Admin client to create topic partitions. Even though the test waits for topic partitions to get created and appear in metadata cache, it doesn’t seem to be sufficient time for leader epoch to get set on the brokers.\r\n\r\nLogs for KRaft

are three common scenarios when Kafka Connect REST requests time out:\r\n\r\n1. A connector operation (such as a call to `Connector::validate`) has blocked\r\n2. A distributed worker's herder tick thread is blocked (which can be for a variety of reasons, including failure to reach the group coordinator, failure to complete startup, and failure to reach the config topic)\r\n3. A distributed worker has to issue its own request to another worker, and that request blocks (note that this does not include transparently-forwarded requests, and currently only includes requests to submit task configurations and perform zombie fencing)\r\n\r\nThis PR adds error messages to REST requests that help capture which operations are causing the worker to be unable to respond in time. The error messages include a description of the action the worker is blocked on, and a human-readable timestamp of when that action began.\r\n\r\nSome rejected alternatives:\r\n- One or more new JMX metrics (harder for users to access, would require a KIP, and would likely be just as difficult to implement, especially when trying to accommodate blocks in both connector interactions, which can take place on an isolated per-request basis, and in a distributed worker's herder tick thread, which can affect multiple REST requests)\r\n- Exposing the stack trace of the distributed worker's herder tick thread as part of the error message for timeouts (does not help with requests that are not blocked because of the herder tick thread, and may present a security risk by including source code for user-provided plugins such as `ConfigProvider` instances)\r\n\r\nDuring review, it may be helpful to focus on these files first (as they contain the internal API for recording and reporting callback stages):\r\n- `HerderRequestHandler` and `ConnectorPluginsResource` (same change applied across both files)\r\n- `Callback`\r\n- `ConvertingFutureCallback`\r\n- `Stage`\r\n- `StagedTimeoutException`\r\n- `TemporaryStage`\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

we get a suspended task re-assigned in the eager rebalance protocol, we have to add the task back to the state updater so that it has a chance to catch up with its change log.\r\n\r\nThis was prevented by a check in `Tasks`, which disallows removing SUSPENDED tasks from the task registry. I couldn't find a reason why this must be an invariant of the task registry, so this weakens the check.\r\n\r\nThe error happens in the integration between TaskRegistry and TaskManager. However, this change anyway adds unit tests to more closely specify the intended behavior of the two modules.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

I encountered a issue that there was always 1 partition having only 1 ISR (no produce traffic on this topic). The bug is related to altering log dir. When replacing current log with future log, broker doesn't copy the leader epoch checkpoint cache, which records the current leader epoch and log start offset. The cache for each partition is updated only when appending new messages or becoming leader. If there is no traffic and the replica is already the leader, the cache will not be updated any more. However, the partition leader will fetch its leader epoch from the cache and compare with the leader epoch sent by follower when handling fetch request. If the former one is missed or less than the latter one, the leader will interrupt the process and return an OffsetOutOfRangeException to follower. The follower might be out of sync over time.\r\n\r\nTake the following case as an example, all the key points are listed in chronological order:\r\n\r\n1. Reassigner submitted a partition reassignment for partition foo-1.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"topic\": \"foo\",\r\n    \"partition\": 1,\r\n    \"replicas\": [\r\n      5002,\r\n      3003,\r\n      4001\r\n    ],\r\n    \"logDirs\": [\r\n      \"\\\\data\\\\kafka-logs-1\",\r\n      \"any\",\r\n      \"any\"\r\n    ]\r\n  } \r\n```\r\n3. Reassignment completed immediately due to there is no traffic on this topic.\r\n4. Controller sent LeaderAndISR requests to all the replicas.\r\n5. Newly added replica 5002 became the new leader and the current log updated the leader epoch offset cache. Replica 5002 successfully handled the LeaderAndISR request.\r\n6. Altering log dir completed and the newly updated current log didn't have leader epoch offset information.\r\n7. Replica 5002 handled fetch requests (include fetch offset and current leader epoch) from followers and returned OffsetOutOfRangeException due to leader epoch offset cache hadn't been updated. So, the replica 5002 couldn't update the fetch state for each follower and reported ISRShrink later. The followers 3003 and 4001 would repeatedly print the following log:\r\n```\r\nWARN [ReplicaFetcher replicaId=4001, leaderId=5002, fetcherId=2] Reset fetch offset for partition foo-1 from 231196 to current leader's start offset 231196 (kafka.server.ReplicaFetcherThread)\r\nINFO [ReplicaFetcher replicaId=4001, leaderId=5002, fetcherId=2] Current offset 231196 for partition foo-1 is out of range, which typically implies a leader change. Reset fetch offset to 231196 (kafka.server.ReplicaFetcherThread)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue arises only when all the three conditions are met:\r\n\r\n1. No produce traffic on the partition.\r\n2. Newly added replica become new leader.\r\n3. LeaderAndISR request is handled successfully before altering log dir completed.","created_at":"2023-10-16T09:35:21Z","updated_at":"2025-01-03T03:38:08Z","closed_at":"2025-01-03T03:38:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

is a POC to refactor `StreamsConfig` to move \"leaking\" internal methods into a newly added subclass `InternalStreamsConfig`, following an already established pattern using for DSL config objects (like `Consumed`, `Produced`, `Materialized` etc). This change requires a KIP.\r\n\r\nWe would deprecate the following methods on `StreamsConfig` to be able to remove them w/o replacement in a future release, as we should consider them internal:\r\n- `confgDef`\r\n- `getMainConsumerConfig`\r\n- `getRestoreConsumeConfig`\r\n- `getGlobalConsumerConfig`\r\n- `getProducerConfig`\r\n- `getAdminConfig`\r\n- `getClientTag`\r\n- `getKafkaClientSupplier`\r\n- `defaultKeySerde`\r\n- `defaultValueSerde`\r\n- `defaultTimestampExtractor`\r\n- `defaultDeserializationHandler`\r\n- `defaultProductionExceptionHandler`\r\n- `main`\r\n- `DUMMY_THREAD_INDEX`\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR changes all internal usage from `StreamsConfig` to `InternalStreamsConfig`.\r\n\r\nIf we believe this is a reasonable change, I can prepare a KIP for it.","created_at":"2023-10-14T16:19:55Z","updated_at":"2025-01-04T00:39:50Z","closed_at":"2024-08-07T01:58:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"29aae1a04d19e61b792d59d486c313e44ca1b2dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null},{"id":2129035451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTI5MDM1NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kip","name":"kip","color":"a01d16","default":false,"description":"Requires

patch adds reconciliation logic to migrating ZK brokers to deal with pending topic deletions as well as missed StopReplicas. \r\n\r\nDuring the hybrid mode of the ZK migration, the KRaft controller is asynchronously sending UMR and LISR to the ZK brokers to propagate metadata. Since this process is essentially \"best effort\" it is possible for a broker to miss a StopReplicas. The new logic lets the ZK broker examine its local logs compared with the full set of replicas in a \"Full\" LISR. Any local logs which are not present in the set of replicas in the request are removed from ReplicaManager and marked as \"stray\". \r\n\r\nTo avoid inadvertent data loss with this new behavior, the brokers do not delete the \"stray\" partitions. They will rename the directories and log warning messages during log recovery. It will be up to the operator to manually delete the stray partitions. We can possibly enhance this in the future to clean up old stray logs.\r\n\r\nThis patch makes use of the previously unused `Type` field on `LeaderAndIsrRequest`. This was added as part of KIP-516 but never implemented. Since it's introduction, an implicit `0` was sent in all LISR. The KRaft controller will now send a value of `2` to indicate a full LISR (as specified by the KIP). The presence of this value acts as a trigger for the ZK broker to perform the log
