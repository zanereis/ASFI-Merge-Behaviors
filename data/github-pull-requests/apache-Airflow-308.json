We've added some unit tests to check that duplicate dependencies and cyclic dependencies are spotted as expected\n- We've added an end-to-end DAG tester to easily build test DAGs\n  - The framework creates a temporary folder where each tested DAG can output some side effect, that can later be validated by the `post_check()` method\n  - We've provided some examples of DAG tests based on the `BashOperator` that validate the current dependency resolution with various `set_upstream`, `set_downstream`, `depends_on_past`, `wait_for_downstream` combined with failing tasks and retries to simulate chaos\n- We've (minor) cleaned up the handling of the default configuration in `configuration.py` + added a first convenience accessor\n\nYou'll find the dag tester framework in

The bug is one where the second attempt to trigger an `@once` dag caused a TypeError through concatenating with a `None` value.\n\nAlso adds a `-y` option to `reset_db` to suppress the confirmation prompt. This is needed to use `reset_db` in the `run_unit_tests.sh` script.\n\nAlso has an update to the readme.\n\nI'm going to open a second PR with a test for the other bug.

I'm using this at Handy (http://www.handy.com/careers/). handle @mtustin-handy and @marcintustin.\n\nThis does three related things:\n1. Adds functionality to trigger_dag to enable it to be used to backfill dagruns in particular states. This is useful to prevent the scheduler trying to catch up with old dag runs when upgrading to version 1.6\n2. Allows the scheduler to gracefully skip externally-triggered DagRuns which have names that conflict with scheduled runs. Without this, triggering a dagrun with a run_id of form \"scheduled__<scheduled date>\" would cause an exception in the scheduler, and prevent it making any progress if its name aligned with that of a scheduled job.\n3. Also add some more logging to make it easier to understand what the scheduler is doing. \n\nBonus:\n\nAdds tests and makes the run_unit_tests.sh script idempotent by deleting the test db every

I kept the defaults as the same as we currently have (I changed the config to reflect to correct names but the default call is the same)\n\nHopefully this will enable people to be more flexible in how they deploy the webserver.

PR implements ldap authentication that is python 3 compatible. \n\nTests:\n- Fully there including testing against a live ldap server on travis.\n\nCaveats:\n- In most of the modules the configuration is imported as \"from airflow import configuration\" in order to make sure different configurations can be unit tested without requiring to re-read a config file. This change creates things like \"configuration.conf.get\" which does not look too pretty an should be cleaned up later.\n- Important: The hack in default_login.py has been removed. There is no required relation between sql-alchemy and flask-login session management. This can make this change incompatible with previous implementations that have overwritten the default_login behavior by supplying \"airflow_login\" in the PYTHON_PATH. This change was required in order to be able to switch authentication backend on the fly while testing. The hack was interfering.\n\nUser changes:\n- You can now specify the authentication backend in the config file by setting auth_backend in the web server section. Old behavior is still available but deprecated.\n\nPlease have a look and tell me what you think and if things need to be updated.\n","created_at":"2015-11-05T22:00:51Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T19:41:13Z","closed_at":"2015-11-09T16:05:15Z","merged_at":"2015-11-09T16:05:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"b366b8dddbca1bd5b77834e542a71ab79c96e3f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/602/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/602/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/602/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/b4b04cd04745a2e93a0686d316da48c78ecde977","head":{"label":"bolkedebruin:conf_multiple","ref":"conf_multiple","sha":"b4b04cd04745a2e93a0686d316da48c78ecde977","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38505714,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODUwNTcxNA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"bolkedebruin/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin/airflow","description":"AirFlow

week we found a rare but repeatable situation where `airflow backfill` would hang forever, insisting a number of tasks were running even though there was no visible activity. This was really nasty to debug. Finally determined that workers were crashing for non-task related reasons (in one case, a memory problem; in another, airflowdb was temporarily unavailable). When the worker disappeared, the task died but no action was ever taken because as far as the `BackfillJob` knew, the task was still `running` (the last recorded TI state).\n\nBroadly: `TaskInstances` are responsible for maintaining their own state. However, `Executors` can also track state (via the `change_state()` method). This means it is possible for the `TaskInstance` state and `Executor` state to disagree. In this case, a CeleryWorker was dying in the middle of task execution, which meant that the TaskInstance couldn't update itself to say it hadn't completed. Mechanically, the `CeleryExecutor.event_buffer` was properly reporting a failed task, but the `TaskInstance` itself was reporting that it was `running`. `BackfillJob` only checks the TaskInstance, not the executor, so it would wait forever for the nonexistent task to complete.\n\nThis PR changes both `SchedulerJob` and `BackfillJob` to check if tasks that claim to be `running` are ACTUALLY running (according to the executor). If not, there must have been a non-task related problem  and the tasks are restarted.\n","created_at":"2015-10-28T20:47:03Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T19:40:46Z","closed_at":"2015-12-11T01:37:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"293b00e4030eaff8b672ade91a358a9abd9ba446","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/569/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/569/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/569/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/c5f58266bcc0bb46956e4af9d6c7c04819a8584a","head":{"label":"jlowin:corner_case_executor","ref":"corner_case_executor","sha":"c5f58266bcc0bb46956e4af9d6c7c04819a8584a","user":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"34ac16ea83af7ba0857892d08e7725a4d67e2ff1","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

as discussed this is the rewiring of the www-app to support returning an app from a function. This is the first step to have the possibility to test multiple configurations on the web interface. Forms, blueprints, views have been put in their own respective module. I think this creates flexibility towards the future and in some cases it is required to get it functional (views). \n\nCaveats: \n- Tests pass, but I haven't been able to test the plugin functionality - no tests for it and no examples.\n- instead of @app in views it is required to use @current_app registration needs to happen in app.py\n\nTodo (in new PR):\n- Rewire the configuration to make it possible to instantiate them\n- Make it possible to pass the configuration to the app\n\nLet me know if anything needs to be different!\n","created_at":"2015-10-25T10:03:55Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T19:41:13Z","closed_at":"2015-10-28T22:01:08Z","merged_at":"2015-10-28T22:01:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"b36726fefefade5754559e81715a713941946814","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/553/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/553/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/553/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/25ecdfb7ad743df0982d70a0e3f7220533e0a873","head":{"label":"bolkedebruin:rewire_www","ref":"rewire_www","sha":"25ecdfb7ad743df0982d70a0e3f7220533e0a873","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38505714,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODUwNTcxNA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"bolkedebruin/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin/airflow","description":"AirFlow
