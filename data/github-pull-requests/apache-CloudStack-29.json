Description\r\n\r\nWe have a current discussion about using `commons.lang3` or our facade `com.cloud.utils` on the code, however a third implementation has been added (`google.common.base`), which end up adding more complexity to the discussion. The two variables of this discussion already implements all we need, therefore adding a third one does not make sense.\r\n\r\nThis PR primary intends to change `com.google.common.base.Strings`'s calls for `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils`'s calls and after that, upgrade `org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils`'s calls to `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils`'s calls.  Also, it will improve some minor codes related to `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils` methods;\r\n\r\nI choose `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils` because our facade `com.cloud.utils.StringUtils` has a lack of methods to be a really facade of `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils` and the methods it already implements are `deprecated`.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [x] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n###

`commons.lang` will be updated to `commons.lang3`;\r\n- Unnecessary libraries will be replaced with `commons.lang3`;\r\n- Unnecessary libraries will be added in module `IllegalImport`, in

Description\r\n\r\nFor VMware, systemvm.iso is copied from MS to secondary store. Current server checks if the desired file is present on the secondary store or not. If it is not present ISO is copied.\r\nThis change adds a check for checksum for source and destination ISO which would allow copying new ISO if there is a mismatch.\r\nUseful in case when file is corrupted in secondary store or new systemvm.iso is generated for dev environment.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to

Description\r\n\r\nWorker VM tags are missed for few cloned VMs in VMware, and so these are skipped when tracking / cleaning up of Worker VMs.  Adding proper Worker VM tags to these VMs would make them trackable from CloudStack.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the (missed) Worker VM tags for the cloned VMs (in VMware) when creating template from volume, and exporting volume to secondary

Description\r\n\r\nWhen a VM is in the Stopped state and the host for it is not found then the server skips sending AttachCommand to the hypervisor. This creates issue with the volume operations if done immediately (without starting the VM).\r\nChange tries to improve this case and finds a suitable host in the VM's cluster when the volume is not

Description\r\nThe recent changes of the main branch enable the global setting to select preferred storage pool and apply its implementation in the VolumeOrchestrator.java in the findStoragePool method\r\n```\r\nOptional<StoragePool> storagePool = getPreferredStoragePool(poolList, vm);\r\n```\r\nBut the usage of it has a potential risk of null pointer exception when the vm parameter in findStoragePool is null, current implementation of getPreferredStoragePool doesn't handle such a condition and directly assumes that VM is never null.\r\n```\r\nString accountStoragePoolUuid = StorageManager.PreferredStoragePool.valueIn(vm.getAccountId());\r\n```\r\nBut in one of the implementations in the same class where the findStoragePool is called, it passes vm variable explicitly as null \r\n*interface*\r\n```\r\npublic VolumeInfo createVolumeFromSnapshot(Volume volume, Snapshot snapshot, UserVm vm) throws StorageUnavailableException;\r\n```\r\nWhen the VM is creating a volume from a snapshot whose VM or pod is not specified, a null pointer exception might happen due to this null passing of the \"VM\" variable around line 467 in the VolumeOrchestrator.java\r\n```\r\nwhile ((pool = findStoragePool(dskCh, dc, pod.first(), null, null, null, poolsToAvoid)) != null) {\r\n                    break;\r\n                }\r\n```\r\nThis PR adds a null handler and returns the default pool when the vm is null\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which

Description\r\n\r\nCloudStack has a feature to get VM metrics, which, for VMWare, is collected from a time window of 5 minutes; This time window (5 minutes) is hard-coded and operators cannot choose which one to use. \r\n\r\nIn vCenter, VMWare has default metric collections time window of 5 minutes, however operators are able to change it, which may cause inconsistency with the hard-coded ACS's time window.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to externalize this configuration via `vmware.stats.time.window` option to allow operators to choose the time window to collect the metrics. Also, I added logs to alert operators in case window interval is not enabled in vCenter.\r\n\r\nInteresting links about this:\r\n - https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/41027/the-vmware-probe-output-error-with-inval.html\r\n - https://www.veeam.com/kb1021\r\n - https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi/issues/783\r\n - https://community.broadcom.com/enterprisesoftware/communities/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?MessageKey=646291e2-9c27-416f-b3e2-b408fd852cf3&CommunityKey=170eb4e5-a593-4af2-ad1d-f7655e31513b&tab=digestviewer\r\n - https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.vcenterhost.doc/GUID-5D85751A-2CE8-4FD5-83C8-90A17060631E.html\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n- I created a VM in CloudStack and maked Network and Disk I/O operations;\r\n- I changed the value of configuration `vmware.stats.time.window`;\r\n- I checked if the error message appears in logs when the interval used is disabled in vCenter;\r\n- After that, I enabled the interval in vCenter;\r\n- I checked if metrics are now collected;\r\n- And checked if VM metrics in ACS are the same at the vCenter (a little difference, but this is expected because ACS call vCenter to collect metrics, when It responses, the VM metrics have changed a little);\r\n- Finally, for my tests, 20 seconds are the minimum acceptable by vCenter 6.5. Less than this result in errors.","created_at":"2021-08-23T15:47:08Z","updated_at":"2021-08-26T11:27:48Z","closed_at":"2021-08-26T11:27:48Z","merged_at":"2021-08-26T11:27:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"8e0e5acea7738da22b1822a9ed3426a392d79a5d","assignee":{"login":"SadiJr","id":31869303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODY5MzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31869303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SadiJr","html_url":"https://github.com/SadiJr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SadiJr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SadiJr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SadiJr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SadiJr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SadiJr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SadiJr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SadiJr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SadiJr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SadiJr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"SadiJr","id":31869303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODY5MzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31869303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SadiJr","html_url":"https://github.com/SadiJr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SadiJr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SadiJr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SadiJr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SadiJr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SadiJr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SadiJr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SadiJr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SadiJr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SadiJr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":37843366,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzg0MzM2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:enhancement","name":"type:enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073207,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMyMDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:vmware","name":"component:vmware","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/16","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/16","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/16/labels","id":5714156,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTcxNDE1Ng==","number":16,"title":"4.16.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":460,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-30T05:24:55Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30

Description\r\n\r\nCloudStack has a feature to keep and increment the VM metrics in memory. This PR intends to externalize one new configuration, `vm.stats.increment.metrics.in.memory` to allow operators to choose if they want to increment VM metrics or not.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n####

Description\r\n\r\nFixes #4433 \r\n\r\n- `snapshot.backup.to.secondary=false`\r\n- Create 2 or more snapshots on Ceph/NFS\r\n- Create volume/template from a snapshot. The snapshot first is copied to secondary storage\r\n- Create volume/template from the second snapshot. The snapshot is not copied to secondary because the snapshot info is retrieved with the wrong SQL query. Operation fails.\r\n\r\nThe problem appears on Ceph/NFS but it probably affects other storage plugins.\r\nBypassing secondary storage is supported only for Ceph primary storage, but it didn't cover the functionality to create volumes from snapshots which are kept only on Ceph.\r\n\r\nWith this fix, if you create snapshots only on NFS and try to create volume/template from a snapshot first, the snapshots are copied to secondary storage. For Ceph, the snapshot will be copied to secondary only when you create a template from a snapshot.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing

Description\r\nIn ACS, primary storages have two scopes, `ZONE` and `CLUSTER`. In KVM, when we are migrating a volume between any source storage to a non managed NFS storage, ACS validates if the destination storage is `CLUSTER` scoped and cancels the migration if it isn't. However, these scopes are just logical limitations created by ACS, they don't affect KVM.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to remove this logical limitation created by ACS.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nI added unit tests and tested locally, in a test lab.\r\n1. I created a VM;\r\n2. I tried to migrate a volume to a `ZONE` scoped storage;\r\n3. Before applying this patch, it threw an exception, after applying, it was migrated;\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-16T20:13:05Z","updated_at":"2021-08-20T17:54:15Z","closed_at":"2021-08-20T17:54:14Z","merged_at":"2021-08-20T17:54:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"9c510091344e7407d0edc3e12ada9e0b04ec8de8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":37843366,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzg0MzM2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:enhancement","name":"type:enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584072971,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzI5NzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:kvm","name":"component:kvm","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/16","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/16","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/16/labels","id":5714156,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTcxNDE1Ng==","number":16,"title":"4.16.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":460,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-30T05:24:55Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T06:54:13Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2021-11-10T02:02:01Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5321/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5321/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/5321/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/5fe3a76ca36c79d91df9fb30bcce48eea9c13ce0","head":{"label":"scclouds:remove-storage-scope-validation-on-kvm-live-migration","ref":"remove-storage-scope-validation-on-kvm-live-migration","sha":"5fe3a76ca36c79d91df9fb30bcce48eea9c13ce0","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github

Description\r\n\r\nFor tables that use `sort_key` field, incorrect results can be returned by the list* APIs while using pagination and with the same values for `sort-key` field. (Default value for `sort_key` field remains `0`).\r\nThis change adds `id` column as secondary sort criteria in such cases.\r\n\r\nFixes #5316\r\n<!---

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR solves issue #5124.\r\n\r\nThe main focus of it is to change how volume snapshots are taken in KVM. However, this proposal of changing `take snapshot` workflow in KVM impacts others snapshot workflows as well. The impacted workflows we mapped are:\r\n- Take volume snapshot with running vm\r\n- Take volume snapshot with stopped vm\r\n- Recurring volume snapshot\r\n- Create template from snapshot\r\n- Create volume from snapshot\r\n- Migrate virtual machine with volumes\r\n- Migrate volumes\r\n- Revert volume snapshot\r\n- Delete volume snapshot\r\n\r\nIssue #5124 has more details and flowcharts of all the mapped workflows.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this PR is to refactor KVM snapshot, others hypervisors workflows should not be affected.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nI added unit tests to several methods and tested the workflows:\r\n\r\n1. Take volume snapshot with running vm\r\n2. Take volume snapshot with stopped vm\r\n3. Recurring volume snapshot\r\n4. Create template from snapshot\r\n5. Create volume from snapshot\r\n6. Migrate virtual machine with volumes\r\n7. Migrate volumes\r\n8. Revert volume snapshot\r\n9. Delete volume snapshot\r\n\r\nThese workflows were tested twice, once with the global setting `snapshot.backup.to.secondary` as `true` and once as `false`.\r\n\r\nTo test workflows 1, 2, and 3, I created a VM called `Test1`, then I opened its console to create a file, which I called `testfile`. At first, I wrote `gold` in this file and took a snapshot that I called `gold` (this tests workflow 1). Then I wrote `silver` to the file and configured a recurring snapshot. I waited for the recurring snapshot and, when it was took, I changed the name in database to `silver`, to facilitate the steps (this tests workflow 2). Finally, I wrote `copper` to the file and stopped the VM, then I took a snapshot (this tests workflow 3). After that, I destroyed VM `Test1`.\r\n\r\nTo test workflow 4, I created a template from snapshot `silver` and called it `template silver`. From it, I created a VM called `Test2`, then I opened its console and retrieved the content of the `testfile` with the command `cat`. It returned `silver`, which is the same value of the file when I took the snapshot on workflow 2. After that, I stopped VM `Test2`.\r\n\r\nTo test workflow 5, I created a volume from snapshot `gold` and called it `volume gold`, then I changed the root volume of the VM `Test2` to the `volume gold`. I started the VM `Test2` and retrieved the content of the `testfile` with the command `cat`. It returned `gold`, which is the same value of the file when I took the snapshot on workflow 1.\r\n\r\nTo test workflows 6 and 7, I wrote `platinum` to the file `testfile` in VM `Test2`, then I took a snapshot and called it `platinum`. I migrated the VM and the volume to another host and primary storage with the API `migrateVirtualMachineWithVolume`. When the global setting `snapshot.backup.to.secondary` was `true`, it migrated successfully. When it was `false`, an exception was threw, warning user about snapshots on primary storage (this tests workflow 6). I stopped the VM and migrated only the volume to another primary storage. When the global setting `snapshot.backup.to.secondary` was `true`, it migrated successfully. When it was `false`, an exception was threw, warning users about snapshots on primary storagee (this tests workflow 7).\r\n\r\nTo test workflow 8, I started VM `Test2` and wrote `diamond` to the file `testfile`. Then I stopped the VM `Test2` and reverted the volume to the snapshot `platinum`. Then I opened its console and retrieved the content of the `testfile` with the command `cat`. It returned `platinum`, which is the same value of the file when I took the snapshot before the workflow 6.\r\n\r\nTo test workflow 9, I deleted all the snapshots.","created_at":"2021-08-09T16:27:57Z","updated_at":"2022-04-12T11:14:28Z","closed_at":"2022-04-12T11:14:28Z","merged_at":"2022-04-12T11:14:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"39fad2d9d7501bdd695aeaf8cb1bf7642efde386","assignee":{"login":"GutoVeronezi","id":38945620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTQ1NjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38945620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi","html_url":"https://github.com/GutoVeronezi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"GutoVeronezi","id":38945620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTQ1NjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38945620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi","html_url":"https://github.com/GutoVeronezi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"GabrielBrascher","id":5025148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5025148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher","html_url":"https://github.com/GabrielBrascher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"slavkap","id":51903378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTAzMzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51903378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavkap","html_url":"https://github.com/slavkap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavkap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavkap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavkap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavkap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavkap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavkap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavkap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavkap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavkap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"weizhouapache","id":57355700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzU1NzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57355700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache","html_url":"https://github.com/weizhouapache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/e

Description\r\n\r\nI've upgraded a stage environment from an older 4.16-SNAPSHOT to the current one and found a regression bug at the VM migration.\r\n\r\nWhen calling the `migrateVirtualMachineWithVolume`, the following `InvalidParameterValueException` is launched: `Unsupported hypervisor: KVM for VM migration, we support XenServer/VMware/KVM only`.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected

Description\r\nPR #4640 added a condition validating if the VM is from hypervisor VMWare, in `AbstractStoragePoolAllocator::reorderPools(List<StoragePool>, VirtualMachineProfile, DeploymentPlan, DiskProfile)`.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/450de92e6cdc6d5611ca4ba701660826d6c70141/engine/storage/src/main/java/org/apache/cloudstack/storage/allocator/AbstractStoragePoolAllocator.java#L188-L191\r\n\r\nHowever, when creating a volume from a snapshot (without VM's id), ACS instantiates the VirtualMachineProfile without a VM:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/75a2c0bd995abc39d02a82c96664f2aecac426d8/engine/orchestration/src/main/java/org/apache/cloudstack/engine/orchestration/VolumeOrchestrator.java#L434\r\n\r\nWhich

NPE is catch and throwed as a `CloudRuntimeException`.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to add a validation if the VM is null before validating its hypervisor.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking

lab.\r\n1. I created VM;\r\n2. I took a snapshot;\r\n3. I tried to create a volume from the snapshot.\r\n   - Before the nulls validation, it would throw an exception:\r\n```\r\nERROR [c.c.a.ApiAsyncJobDispatcher] (API-Job-Executor-1:ctx-7ec7e521

Description\r\nWhen starting a VM on KVM, ACS sets VM's CPU topology through a calculation of CPU sockets and CPU cores per socket on VM's XML. Along the calculation, for instance, it assumes that a VM that use 12 vCPUs automatically works with 2 sockets and 6 cores, or a VM that use 16 vCPUs automatically works 4 sockets and 4 cores:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/d6a77a72f00d01e82b536c2b9d43c00690ee96fd/plugins/hypervisors/kvm/src/main/java/com/cloud/hypervisor/kvm/resource/LibvirtComputingResource.java#L4504-L4524\r\n\r\nThis behavior is arbitrary and operators cannot choose to use it or not.\r\n\r\nBy default ([fedora - Setting KVM processor affinities](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/13/html/Virtualization_Guide/ch25s06.html)), if we not determine the CPU topology, the hypervisor will alloc the VM on any available CPU; Therefore, this PR intends to externalize a property (`enable.manually.setting.cpu.topology.on.kvm.vm`) on `agent.properties` to allow the operators to decide if they want to do the calculation or not. The default behavior still will be to do the calculation.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code

Tested?\r\nIt was tested on a local lab.\r\n\r\n- I created a host with 1 socket and 8 cores;\r\n- I created a VM with 8 vCPUs;\r\n- When the property doesn't exist in the file or when it is true, the topology is set:\r\n   - `<topology sockets='2' cores='4' threads='1'/>`;\r\n- When the property is set to `false`, the topology is not set;","created_at":"2021-08-03T20:17:49Z","updated_at":"2021-08-16T02:52:51Z","closed_at":"2021-08-16T02:52:50Z","merged_at":"2021-08-16T02:52:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"349120f7c507c8a2f75c1d4f0e217c97d770bf48","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":37843366,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzg0MzM2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:enhancement","name":"type:enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584072971,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzI5NzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:kvm","name":"component:kvm","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/16","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/16","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/16/labels","id":5714156,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTcxNDE1Ng==","number":16,"title":"4.16.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":460,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-07-30T05:24:55Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T06:54:13Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2021-11-10T02:02:01Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5273/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5273/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/5273/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/d2b01e30247532628d72a426c0dd87788bae8106","head":{"label":"GutoVeronezi:externalize-config-to-enable-manually-setting-cpu-topology-on-kvm-vm","ref":"externalize-config-to-enable-manually-setting-cpu-topology-on-kvm-vm","sha":"d2b01e30247532628d72a426c0dd87788bae8106","user":{"login":"GutoVeronezi","id":38945620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTQ1NjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38945620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi","html_url":"https://github.com/GutoVeronezi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":325596270,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjU1OTYyNzA=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"GutoVeronezi/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GutoVeronezi","id":38945620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTQ1NjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38945620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi","html_url":"https://github.com/GutoVeronezi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/received_events","

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR aims at making the upgrade path a bit more seamless, by removing the need to register the systemvm template prior to initiating upgrade. This is done by packaging the templates as part of cloudstack-management and on performing yum upgrade `cloudstack-management`, if the template isn't already registered, it'll register the template automatically.\r\nThis PR also validates if the systemVM template is seeded in case of fresh installation, and if not, registers the systemVM template during secondary storage addition.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL -

it validates if the template is actually seeded and only if not done, will it register the systemVM template during image storage addition (the 1st image store of the zone)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document -->\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-02T07:31:38Z","updated_at":"2021-08-18T11:20:37Z","closed_at":"2021-08-18T11:20:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"394be552677a3e498378f4db5b6afa30d810d5f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5264/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5264/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/5264/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/4a36d23c92b61b895b65b5a0778ffc087dffe7db","head":{"label":"shapeblue:sysvm-upgrade-improvements","ref":"sysvm-upgrade-improvements","sha":"4a36d23c92b61b895b65b5a0778ffc087dffe7db","user":{"login":"shapeblue","id":6001764,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYwMDE3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6001764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue","html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35481491,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTQ4MTQ5MQ==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"shapeblue/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shapeblue","id":6001764,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYwMDE3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6001764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue","html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue/cloudstack","description":"The upstream repository is at http://github.com/apache/cloudstack.

Description\r\nCurrently all the volumes are allocated on storage pools\r\nbased on the capacity or the algorithm selected. Sometimes\r\nwe need to deploy all volumes of particular account in a\r\nspecific storage pool and in that case its not possible.\r\n\r\nwith this change, we can specify the uuid of the preferred\r\nstorage pool, so that all volumes of the account will be\r\ndeployed in this pool\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed.

Description\r\nEach VM deployed in CS get an alphanumeric value as  internal CS name (cloud.vm.internal.name) . Each VM that will be ingested get no internal CS name and the internal name = VM name. \r\n\r\nCS use for a couple of actions the internal CS name if exist and therefore CS can no longer update this properties. For an example power state.\r\n\r\nThis PR add the internalCSName to VirtualMaschineMO and UnmanagedInstanceTO  inside the loadCache method to use this value  as instance name during the ingest.

Description\r\nOn KVMHAMonitor, the heartbeat timeout is hardcoded to `60000` ms; therefore, operators do not have options to choose which timeout they want/need. \r\n\r\nThis PR intends to externalize the heartbeat timeout configuration on KVMHAMonitor.\r\n\r\nDepending on the use case, this timeout might need increasing/decreasing. Therefore, it is interesting to externalize such configurations for cloud operators. The hardcoded value is taken as the default one. Therefore, the current behavior is maintained.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functioanlity)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt has been tested locally on a test lab.\r\n1. I changed my log4j to debug mode.\r\n2. I added and changed `hearbeat.update.timeout` setting to `agent.properties` file several times.\r\n3. I restarted agent and watched the
