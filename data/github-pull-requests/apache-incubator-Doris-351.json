Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDoris version-0.12 V1 segment  only supports creating zone map index for key columns. Doris version-0.13 supports creating zone map index for key columns and duplicate model columns. Lastest version supports creating zone map for key columns in AGG_KEYS or all columns in UNIQUE_KEYS or DUP_KEYS. In V1 Segment file, the tablet meta contains zone map index. But in V2 Segment file, it does not.\r\n\r\nWhen upgrade Doris from version-0.12 to version-0.13, we found the memory is obviousely increasing in table with V1 segement file. Because a lots value columns create zone map index. Therefore, it is better to be compatible with version-0.12. The config `enable_value_column_zonemap` is default false. If it is need to add zone map index for value colums, you can set it true.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWhen get a table meta content by a http interface, Doris will transfer tablet meta into json string.

Therefore we add a uri param `enable_byte_to_base64` to support not transfer byte into base64 code.  Look at Pic2, Field `default : \"10\"` is readble.

the table lock can control the simultaneous modification of the table by different threads.\r\nBut it cannot control the drop operation of the table by other threads.\r\nFor example, when drop table and table update occur at the same time.\r\n\r\n1. get table object by thread 1\r\n2. drop table by thread 2 with table lock\r\n3. update table object by thread 1\r\n\r\nThe above process is possible.\r\nAt this time, step 3 actually operates a table that no longer exists, which will eventually cause NullPointerException.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the modified table log after the drop table can be ignored. The reason is that it is meaningless to modify information on a table that no longer exists.\r\n\r\nFixed #5687\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nCurrently Tablet meta checkpoint is a memory-exhausted operation. If a host has 12 disks, it will start 12 threads to do tablet meta checkpoint. In our experience, the data size of one tablet can be as high as 2G. If 12 threads do the checkpoint at the same time, it maybe cause OOM.\r\nTherefore, this PR try to solve this problem. Firstly, it only start one thread to produce table meta checkpoint tasks. Secondly, it creates a threadpool to handle these tasks. You can configure the size of the thread pool to control the parrallelism  in case of OOM. It is a prducer-customer model.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nTablet meta checkpoint is a operation to serialize tablet meta data and stores it into RocksDB. It is a cpu-exhausted and memory-exhausted operation. The data size of some tablet is high as 2G. In `serialize` function, the data has been deserialize to check the result, therefore it is no need to deserialize again to check  the result in function `save`. In reality, checkpoint often causes OOM.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [x] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nSometimes the scanner thread pool will become a performance bottleneck. In this case, we can solve it by adding scanner thread.But, now there is no relevant metric that can help us quickly find this problem. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds metric for scanner/etl thread_pool's queue size, which can reflect the load of the thread pool. And can help us quickly locate the performance problems related to the etl/scanner thread pool.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWe hope that `cumulative compaction` can be implemented as soon as possible, but `base compaction` tasks are likely to  execute for a long time and occupy most of the threads in thread pool, which may result in high CPU load. \r\n\r\nThis patch submits `cumulative compaction` and `base compaction` into separate thread pool. So we have more flexibility to adjust the execution of `cumulative compaction` and `base compaction`according to the status of cluster.\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n1. Update metrics of `tablet_base_max_compaction_score` and `tablet_cumulative_max_compaction_score`. This two metrics should show `max compaction score` for base comapction and cumulative compaction after a round of task production in BE.\r\n2.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n    [Colocate plan][Step4] Colocate set operation node\r\n\r\n    The set operation node (such as union, intersect, except) could colocate\r\n    when data partition of all of child fragments are same as the input partition of set operation node.\r\n    At the same time, the child node of the set operation is greater than one.\r\n    Therefore, only scan nodes between different nodes in a colocate group can colocate.\r\n\r\n    The planning of the collection node after colocate is as follows:\r\n    |   0:INTERSECT                                                                    |\r\n    |   |  colocate=true                                                               |\r\n    |   |----2:OlapScanNode                                                            |\r\n    |   |       TABLE: t2                                                              |\r\n    |   |----3:OlapScanNode                                                            |\r\n    |   |       TABLE: t3                                                              |\r\n    |   1:OlapScanNode                                                                 |\r\n    |      TABLE: t1                                                                   |\r\n    From the above figure, we can see that the intersect node is absorbed by the child nodes,\r\n    and the exchange node is no longer needed between the three child nodes and the intersect node.\r\n\r\n    This pr also supports the absorption of a single node.\r\n    When the child node itself has only one instance, the upper node will be directly absorbed into the lower node.\r\n    This optimization can reduce unnecessary data transmission.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThe underlying sort node of the window function can also be colocate sorted.\r\n    When the data distribution of the child fragment is less than or equal to the sorting column,\r\n      the sorting node can perform local sorting.\r\n    This can reduce unnecessary data transmission, thereby improving query performance.\r\n\r\n    For example:\r\n    The table schema: k1, k2, k3, k4\r\n    The table is distrubited by: k1, k2\r\n    Query: select k1, sum(k2) over(partition by k1 order by k2) from test_colocate;\r\n    The colocate plan is following:\r\n\r\n    |

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n[Colocate plan][Step2] Colocate aggregation covers more situations\r\n\r\n    The old colocate aggregation can only cover the case where the child is scan.\r\n    In fact, as long as the child's data distribution meets the requirements,\r\n      no matter what the plan node on the child node is, a colocate aggregation can be performed.\r\n\r\n    This PR also fixes the correct data partition attribute of fragment.\r\n    The data partition of fragment which contains scan node is Hash Partition rather than Random.\r\n    This modification is mainly to determine the possibility of colocate\r\n      through the correct distribution of child fragments.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis CL optimizes the performance of `MysqlResultWriter` in two aspects\r\n1. Use `fmt::format_int` to do int->string conversion, which is 6x faster than `sprintf` according to [this blog](https://www.zverovich.net/2020/06/13/fast-int-to-string-revisited.html)\r\n2. Reduce profiling overhead by measuring convert time at row batch level instead of row level\r\n\r\nThis fixes #5553 . The `TupleConvertTime` dropped from 185.573ms to 27ms after this optimization.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [x] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-22T09:15:00Z","updated_at":"2021-04-08T01:16:58Z","closed_at":"2021-04-08T01:16:58Z","merged_at":"2021-04-08T01:16:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"2b5e4dc95103240a34ff989a1664f3d209fb8db0","assignee":{"login":"yangzhg","id":9098473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwOTg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9098473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg","html_url":"https://github.com/yangzhg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"yangzhg","id":9098473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwOTg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9098473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg","html_url":"https://github.com/yangzhg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965628,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/improvement","name":"kind/improvement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates
