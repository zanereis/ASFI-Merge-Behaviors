pages, we explicitly decode the dictionary for the values that are already dictionary encoded. Currently we reset the dictionary while reading every page that can potentially cause `java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` while decoding older pages.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nChange SystemClock to derive time from System.nanoTime() instead of System.currentTimeMillis(). This is because using System.currentTimeMillis() makes waitTillTime() routine brittle against systems like VMs where time can go forward and backwards.\n\nShout out to @steveloughran for doing a good chunk of research and a previous PR (#8766) on this in 2015.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nBuild is green, I am running unit tests, they are looking green, but are also taking a while. So, filing this PR a little proactively.\n","created_at":"2016-07-15T17:59:57Z","updated_at":"2016-12-08T20:58:46Z","closed_at":"2016-12-08T20:58:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"263781ec5c88d4d81ed8bbe935ddf71367448816","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14223/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14223/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14223/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3dec78a28147588ce7d88eb4e5790265af8ca28b","head":{"label":"markgrover:SPARK-10614","ref":"SPARK-10614","sha":"3dec78a28147588ce7d88eb4e5790265af8ca28b","user":{"login":"markgrover","id":1709451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover","html_url":"https://github.com/markgrover","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17418333,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzQxODMzMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"markgrover/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"markgrover","id":1709451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover","html_url":"https://github.com/markgrover","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/markgrover/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`KeyValueGroupedDataset.reduceGroups` is currently implemented via `flatMapGroups`, which does not support partial aggregation and so is very

`ParquetIOSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-07-15T04:54:43Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:40:03Z","closed_at":"2016-07-20T08:12:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8f220b3659bb271ededea12328f31ba0a532a9da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14217/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14217/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14217/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0593febecd01a9a5ee32aa6ef47afb3b9f8fb497","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-16562","ref":"SPARK-16562","sha":"0593febecd01a9a5ee32aa6ef47afb3b9f8fb497","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds schema compatibility for Parquet.\n\nCurrently if user-given schema is different with the Parquet schema, it throws an exception even when the user-given schema is compatible with Parquet schema.\n\nFor example, executing the codes below:\n\n``` scala\nval path = \"/tmp/test.parquet\"\nval data = (1 to 4).map(Tuple1(_))\nspark.createDataFrame(data).toDF(\"a\").write.parquet(path)\nval schema = StructType(StructField(\"a\", LongType, true) :: Nil)\nspark.read.schema(schema).parquet(path).show()\n```\n\nthrows an exception as below:\n\n```\norg.apache.parquet.io.ParquetDecodingException: Can not read value at 1 in block 0 \n...\n```\n\nThis PR lets Parqet supports this schema compatibility.\n- [x] Schema compatibility for `NumericType` except `DecimalType`. \n- [ ] Schema compatibility for other `AtomicType`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests in

Problem\n\nAs reported by [SPARK-16545](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16545), in `ForeachSink` we have initialized 3 rounds of physical planning.\n\nMore specific:\n\n[1] In `StreamExecution`, [lastExecution.executedPlan](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/StreamExecution.scala#L369)\n\n[2] In `ForeachSink`, [forearchPartition() calls withNewExecutionId(..., **_queryExection_**)](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/Dataset.scala#L2145), which further calls [**_queryExecution_**.executedPlan](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9a5071996b968148f6b9aba12e0d3fe888d9acd8/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/SQLExecution.scala#L55)\n\n[3] In `ForeachSink`, [val rdd = { ... incrementalExecution = new IncrementalExecution ...}](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/ForeachSink.scala#L53)\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n[1] ~~should not be eliminated in general;~~ is eliminated for case `ForeachSink`;\n\n**[2] is eliminated, by replacing the `queryExecution` with `incrementalExecution` provided by [3];**\n\n[3] should be eliminated but can not be done at this stage; let's revisit it when SPARK-16264 is resolved.\n## How was this patch tested?\n- checked manually now there ~~are only 2 rounds~~ is only 1 round of physical planning in ForeachSink after this patch\n- existing tests ensure it cause no

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nMade DataFrame-based API primary\n- Spark doc menu bar and other places now link to ml-guide.html, not mllib-guide.html\n- mllib-guide.html keeps RDD-specific list of features, with a link at the top redirecting people to ml-guide.html\n- ml-guide.html includes a \"maintenance mode\" announcement about the RDD-based API\n  - **Reviewers: please check this carefully**\n- (minor) Titles for DF API no longer include \"- spark.ml\" suffix.  Titles for RDD API have \"- RDD-based API\" suffix\n- Moved migration guide to ml-guide from mllib-guide\n  - Also moved past guides from mllib-migration-guides to ml-migration-guides, with a redirect link on mllib-migration-guides\n  - **Reviewers**: I did not change any of the content of the migration guides.\n\nReorganized DataFrame-based guide:\n- ml-guide.html mimics the old mllib-guide.html page in terms of content: overview, migration guide, etc.\n- Moved Pipeline description into ml-pipeline.html and moved tuning into ml-tuning.html\n  - **Reviewers**: I did not change the content of these guides, except some intro text.\n- Sidebar remains the same, but with pipeline and tuning sections added\n\nOther:\n- ml-classification-regression.html: Moved text about linear methods to new section in page\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nGenerated docs locally\n","created_at":"2016-07-15T01:31:59Z","updated_at":"2016-07-19T20:26:00Z","closed_at":"2016-07-15T20:40:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0da2c62268070f868a031c29997b642fa1f41541","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14213/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14213/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14213/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/00c9941b7c113afc1d7ab2a59b50c208f46e0cc9","head":{"label":"jkbradley:ml-guide-2.0","ref":"ml-guide-2.0","sha":"00c9941b7c113afc1d7ab2a59b50c208f46e0cc9","user":{"login":"jkbradley","id":5084283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODQyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5084283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19877817,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTg3NzgxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"jkbradley/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jkbradley","id":5084283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODQyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5084283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n**Issue 1: Silent Ignorance of Bucket Specification When Creating Table Using Schema Inference**\n\nWhen creating a data source table without explicit specification of schema or SELECT clause, we silently ignore the bucket specification (CLUSTERED BY... SORTED BY...) in [the code](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ce3b98bae28af72299722f56e4e4ef831f471ec0/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/command/createDataSourceTables.scala#L339-L354).\n\nFor example,\n\n``` SQL\nCREATE TABLE jsonTable\nUSING org.apache.spark.sql.json\nOPTIONS (\n  path '${tempDir.getCanonicalPath}'\n)\nCLUSTERED BY (inexistentColumnA) SORTED BY (inexistentColumnB) INTO 2 BUCKETS\n```\n\nThis PR captures it and issues an error message.\n\n**Issue 2: Got a run-time `java.lang.ArithmeticException` when num of buckets is set to zero.**\n\nFor example,\n\n``` SQL\nCREATE TABLE t USING PARQUET\nOPTIONS (PATH '${path.toString}')\nCLUSTERED BY (a) SORTED BY (b) INTO 0 BUCKETS\nAS SELECT 1 AS a, 2 AS b\n```\n\nThe exception we got is\n\n```\nERROR org.apache.spark.executor.Executor: Exception in task 0.0 in stage 1.0 (TID 2)\njava.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero\n```\n\nThis PR captures the misuse and issues an appropriate error message.\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a test case in DDLSuite\n","created_at":"2016-07-14T22:54:10Z","updated_at":"2016-07-22T05:29:05Z","closed_at":"2016-07-22T05:29:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f90484331b97895c44a3a52aa4f79feaafcf7c68","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14210/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14210/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14210/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/de4316b28bc321b0c6c3ca7cfe091c02de685637","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:createTableWithoutSchema","ref":"createTableWithoutSchema","sha":"de4316b28bc321b0c6c3ca7cfe091c02de685637","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, in Spark SQL, the initial creation of schema can be classified into two groups. It is applicable to both Hive tables and Data Source tables:\n\n**Group A. Users specify the schema.** \n\n_Case 1 CREATE TABLE AS SELECT_: the schema is determined by the result schema of the SELECT clause. For example,\n\n``` SQL\nCREATE TABLE tab STORED AS TEXTFILE\nAS SELECT * from input\n```\n\n_Case 2 CREATE TABLE_: users explicitly specify the schema. For example,\n\n``` SQL\nCREATE TABLE jsonTable (_1 string, _2 string)\nUSING org.apache.spark.sql.json\n```\n\n**Group B. Spark SQL infers the schema at runtime.**\n\n_Case 3 CREATE TABLE_. Users do not specify the schema but the path to the file location. For example,\n\n``` SQL\nCREATE TABLE jsonTable \nUSING org.apache.spark.sql.json\nOPTIONS (path '${tempDir.getCanonicalPath}')\n```\n\nBefore this PR, Spark SQL does not store the inferred schema in the external catalog for the cases in Group B. When users refreshing the metadata cache, accessing the table at the first time after (re-)starting Spark, Spark SQL will infer the schema and store the info in the metadata cache for improving the performance of subsequent metadata requests. However, the runtime schema inference could cause undesirable schema changes after each reboot of Spark.\n\nThis PR is to store the inferred schema in the external catalog when creating the table. ~~When users intend to refresh the schema after possible changes on external files (table location), they issue `REFRESH TABLE`. Spark SQL will infer the schema again based on the previously specified table location and update/refresh the schema in the external catalog and metadata cache~~ For data source tables, the schema will not be inferred and refreshed. If the schema is changed, they need to recreate a new table. For managed tables, the schema can be changed through the DDL statements.\n\nIn this PR, we do not use the inferred schema to replace the user specified schema for avoiding external behavior changes . Based on the design, user-specified schemas (as described in Group A) can be changed by ALTER TABLE commands, although we do not support them now. \n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nTODO: add more cases to cover the changes.\n","created_at":"2016-07-14T20:11:40Z","updated_at":"2016-08-08T22:44:31Z","closed_at":"2016-07-28T09:31:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1a44f2ed1034406568f967a219f47f44298c88f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14207/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14207/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14207/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b694d8bd3666e54e4d3ab972edcb04f2be64669b","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:userSpecifiedSchema","ref":"userSpecifiedSchema","sha":"b694d8bd3666e54e4d3ab972edcb04f2be64669b","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdded a new column named \"Worker\" in the Executor Page of the web UI. For each executor (except the driver), it will provide a link to the web UI of the worker it belongs to.\n\nThis PR also retrieved worker URLs (besides worker _UI_ URLs) from `ExecutorRunner` to `ExecutorsPage`. This would help if we want to show then on the Executor Page later. (See https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14204#issuecomment-232711795)\n\nBecause the data of the URLs had not been retrieved to the executor UI (even not in the executor), passing them have the following effects:\n- The DeveloperApi `ExecutorInfo` is changed. A new argument, `workerUrl: Map[String, String]`, is added in the constructor of that class. But it is set to `Map.empty` by default, so calling the old API still works. The executors for local and Mesos are stilling using call the old API.\n- The JSON converter of `ExecutorInfo` is update.\n- The REST API for executors has a new item call \"worker\", it looks like this:\n\n```\n  \"worker\" : {\n    \"url\" : \"spark://Worker@192.168.1.104:32790\",\n    \"ui_url\" : \"http://192.168.1.104:46445\"\n  }\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRun Spark as a \"local cluster\" by `./bin/spark-shell --master=local-cluster[2,1,1024]`. Then view the Executor Page on [http://localhost:4040/executors/](http://localhost:4040/executors/).\n\nYou might need to clear the cache at the browser since some resources are changed. (especially `/static/executorspage-template.html.`)\n\nSee the column \"Worker\" on the right of the Executors Table. For each executor, click the hypertext link, jump to the web UI of the worker it belongs

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWith the fix from SPARK-13112, I see that `LaunchTask` is always processed after `RegisteredExecutor` is done and so it gets chance to do all retries to startup an executor. There is still a problem that if `Executor` creation itself fails and there is some exception, it gets unnoticed and the executor is killed when it tries to process the `LaunchTask` as `executor` is null : https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/executor/CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend.scala#L88 So if one looks at the logs, it does not tell that there was problem during `Executor` creation and thats why it was killed.\n\nThis PR explicitly catches exception in `Executor` creation, logs a proper message and then exits the JVM. Also, I have changed the `exitExecutor` method to accept `reason` so that backends can use that reason and do stuff like logging to a DB to get an aggregate of such exits at a cluster level\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI am relying on existing tests\n","created_at":"2016-07-14T14:51:22Z","updated_at":"2016-08-09T20:45:37Z","closed_at":"2016-07-15T21:29:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c9c1b598529fbcb0418459c235d22643c25e0167","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14202/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14202/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14202/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a4f80f58694127cab846803b8162cfb0a50b7026","head":{"label":"tejasapatil:exit_executor_failure","ref":"exit_executor_failure","sha":"a4f80f58694127cab846803b8162cfb0a50b7026","user":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50031489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDAzMTQ4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"tejasapatil/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFix bugs about types that result an array of null when creating DataFrame using python.\n\nPython's array.array have richer type than python itself, e.g. we can have `array('f',[1,2,3])` and `array('d',[1,2,3])`. Codes in spark-sql and pyspark didn't take this into consideration which might cause a problem that you get an array of null values when you have `array('f')` in your rows.\n\nA simple code to reproduce this bug is:\n\n```\nfrom pyspark import SparkContext\nfrom pyspark.sql import SQLContext,Row,DataFrame\nfrom array import array\n\nsc = SparkContext()\nsqlContext = SQLContext(sc)\n\nrow1 = Row(floatarray=array('f',[1,2,3]), doublearray=array('d',[1,2,3]))\nrows = sc.parallelize([ row1 ])\ndf = sqlContext.createDataFrame(rows)\ndf.show()\n```\n\nwhich have output\n\n```\n+---------------+------------------+\n|    doublearray|        floatarray|\n+---------------+------------------+\n|[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]|[null, null,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen I scan through the pom.xml of sub projects, I found this warning as below and attached screenshot\n\n```\nDefinition of groupId is redundant, because it's inherited from the parent\n```\n\n![screen shot 2016-07-13 at 3 13 11 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3925641/16823121/744f893e-4916-11e6-8a52-042f83b9db4e.png)\n\nI've tried to remove some of the lines with groupId definition, and the build on my local machine is still ok.\n\n```\n<groupId>org.apache.spark</groupId>\n```\n\nAs I just find now `<maven.version>3.3.9</maven.version>` is being used in Spark 2.x, and Maven-3 supports versionless parent elements: Maven 3 will remove the need to specify the parent version in sub modules. THIS is great (in Maven 3.1).\n\nref: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3157240/maven-3-worth-it/3166762#3166762\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI've tested by re-building the project, and build succeeded.\n","created_at":"2016-07-13T23:27:08Z","updated_at":"2016-07-19T11:02:07Z","closed_at":"2016-07-19T11:02:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e4d0a4c8f90649f195971b4fb791c6f314641e50","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14189/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14189/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14189/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b0decb1f70652bc7fa3d46b50258f95d82a9437a","head":{"label":"keypointt:SPARK-16535","ref":"SPARK-16535","sha":"b0decb1f70652bc7fa3d46b50258f95d82a9437a","user":{"login":"keypointt","id":3925641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjU2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3925641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt","html_url":"https://github.com/keypointt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":43392545,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MzM5MjU0NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"keypointt/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"keypointt","id":3925641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjU2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3925641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt","html_url":"https://github.com/keypointt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/keypointt/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSupport automatic deployment of Anaconda or virtualenv environment on executor, and add wheel and wheelhouse support to PySpark, based on SPARK-13587 (see #13599). \n\nFull description in [SPARK-16367](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16367)\n\nThe developer write its Python code and it describes the dependencies of this script (`numpy`, `pandas`, `requests`,...) inside a `requirements.txt` file. When the job will be deployed on the executor (and when the driver will be deployed in cluster mode), the same environment will be automatically setup using `pip` (or `conda`).\n\nSpark submit looks like:\n\n```\n    bin/spark-submit                                                              \\\n        --master spark://sparkcluster:7077                                        \\\n        --deploy-mode client                                                      \\\n        --verbose                                                                 \\\n        --files requirements.txt,/path/to/mypackage.tag.gz                        \\\n        --conf \"spark.pyspark.virtualenv.enabled=true\"                            \\\n        --conf \"spark.pyspark.virtualenv.system_site_packages=false\"              \\\n        --conf \"spark.eventLog.enabled=true\"                                      \\\n        --conf \"spark.eventLog.dir=/tmp/spark-events\"                             \\\n        --conf \"spark.pyspark.virtualenv.bin.path=virtualenv\"                     \\\n        --conf \"spark.pyspark.virtualenv.use_index=true\"                          \\\n        --conf \"spark.pyspark.virtualenv.requirements=requirements.txt\"           \\\n        --conf \"spark.pyspark.virtualenv.trusted_host=internal.pypi.mirror\"       \\\n        --conf \"spark.pyspark.virtualenv.upgrade_pip=true\"                        \\\n        --conf \"spark.pyspark.virtualenv.install_package=mypackage.tag.gz\"        \\\n        --conf \"spark.pyspark.virtualenv.index_url=https://internal.pypi.mirror/\" \\\n        /path/to/runner.py\n```\n\nContent of `runner.py`:\n\n```\nimport mypackage\nmypackage.main()\n```\n\n(this runner script is needed because `--class` does not work for Python, only java)\n\n`mypackage` is built using the classic `python setup.py sdist`. Could be a wheel as well, eventhough distributing a source package for the job is safer.\n\nI have described a bit more this approach [here](http://www.great-a-blog.co/wheel-deployment-for-pyspark/)\n\nIn bonus, this PR adds support for \"wheelhouse\" deployment, where all dependencies are packaged into a single archive, so that no network connection is needed when Spark executors deploy the environment\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually tested on Ubuntu, Spark Standalone. Seems to work on YARN cluster as well.\n","created_at":"2016-07-13T13:28:54Z","updated_at":"2019-04-29T23:16:54Z","closed_at":"2019-04-29T23:16:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"22055113c8a6f31561d2a132fdd5e70b28c8dcf5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14180/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14180/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14180/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cf977e4f7dca5be43e51a1b7788646d7a4f2d775","head":{"label":"gsemet:wheelhouse_support","ref":"wheelhouse_support","sha":"cf977e4f7dca5be43e51a1b7788646d7a4f2d775","user":{"login":"gsemet","id":133498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsemet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62233595,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjIzMzU5NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gsemet/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gsemet","id":133498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsemet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gsemet/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is the second step for the following feature:\n\nFor hash aggregation in Spark SQL, we use a fast aggregation hashmap to act as a \"cache\" in order to boost aggregation performance. Previously, the hashmap is backed by a `ColumnarBatch`. This has performance issues when we have wide schema for the aggregation table (large number of key fields or value fields). \nIn this JIRA, we support another implementation of fast hashmap, which is backed by a `RowBatch`. We then automatically pick between the two implementations based on certain knobs.\n\nIn this second-step PR, we enable `RowBasedHashMapGenerator` in `HashAggregateExec`. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded tests: `RowBasedAggregateHashMapSuite` and `VectorizedAggregateHashMapSuite`\nAdditional micro-benchmarks tests and TPCDS results will be added in a separate PR in the series.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is the first step for the following feature:\n\nFor hash aggregation in Spark SQL, we use a fast aggregation hashmap to act as a \"cache\" in order to boost aggregation performance. Previously, the hashmap is backed by a `ColumnarBatch`. This has performance issues when we have wide schema for the aggregation table (large number of key fields or value fields). \nIn this JIRA, we support another implementation of fast hashmap, which is backed by a `RowBasedKeyValueBatch`. We then automatically pick between the two implementations based on certain knobs.\n\nIn this first-step PR, implementations for `RowBasedKeyValueBatch` and `RowBasedHashMapGenerator` are added. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests: `RowBasedKeyValueBatchSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-07-13T08:04:48Z","updated_at":"2016-07-25T22:08:07Z","closed_at":"2016-07-25T20:33:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4b3a7c50886422b9cb8d0e6f952ab1b2fab0e46d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14174/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14174/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14174/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5bd4bca5c20cd1f59436280d641c6c3a17fef290","head":{"label":"ooq:rowbasedfastaggmap-pr1","ref":"rowbasedfastaggmap-pr1","sha":"5bd4bca5c20cd1f59436280d641c6c3a17fef290","user":{"login":"ooq","id":5876435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzY0MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5876435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq","html_url":"https://github.com/ooq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44266813,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDI2NjgxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"ooq/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ooq","id":5876435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzY0MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5876435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq","html_url":"https://github.com/ooq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ooq/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIt seems ORC supports all the types in  ([`PredicateLeaf.Type`](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/e085b7e9bd059d91aaf013df0db4d71dca90ec6f/storage-api/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/sarg/PredicateLeaf.java#L50-L56)) which includes timestamp type and decimal type.\n\nIn more details, the types listed in [`SearchArgumentImpl.boxLiteral()`](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/branch-1.2/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/sarg/SearchArgumentImpl.java#L1068-L1093) can be used as a filter value.\n\nFYI, inital `case` caluse for supported types was introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/65d71bd9fbfe6fe1b741c80fed72d6ae3d22b028 and this was not changed overtime. At that time, Hive version was, 0.13 which supports only some types for filter-push down (See [SearchArgumentImpl.java#L945-L965](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/branch-0.13/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/sarg/SearchArgumentImpl.java#L945-L965) at 0.13).\n\nHowever, the version was upgraded into 1.2.x and now it supports more types (See [SearchArgumentImpl.java#L1068-L1093](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/branch-1.2/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/sarg/SearchArgumentImpl.java#L1068-L1093) at 1.2.0)\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests in `OrcFilterSuite` and `OrcQuerySuite`\n","created_at":"2016-07-13T05:48:42Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:40:04Z","closed_at":"2016-09-27T16:52:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e22050473dbbab57e3a50d834f710e3842315f91","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14172/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14172/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14172/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ade0ad27459248d3db1c7e453cbf724596a50a2a","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-16516","ref":"SPARK-16516","sha":"ade0ad27459248d3db1c7e453cbf724596a50a2a","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn `ScriptInputOutputSchema`, we read default `RecordReader` and `RecordWriter` from conf. Since Spark 2.0 has deleted those config keys from hive conf, we have to set default reader/writer class name by ourselves. Otherwise we will get `None` for `LazySimpleSerde`, the data written would not be able to read by script. The test case added worked fine with previous version of Spark, but would fail now.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nadded a test case in SQLQuerySuite.\n","created_at":"2016-07-13T02:33:58Z","updated_at":"2016-07-18T21:00:25Z","closed_at":"2016-07-18T21:00:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c8ba07bd6a4ea0760fcd56ef99b95128d7f1c01","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14169/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14169/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14169/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0edfed48a1e6a438a18d488404b900a51475a2d5","head":{"label":"adrian-wang:script","ref":"script","sha":"0edfed48a1e6a438a18d488404b900a51475a2d5","user":{"login":"adrian-wang","id":3078910,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzg5MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3078910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang","html_url":"https://github.com/adrian-wang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18545588,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU0NTU4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"adrian-wang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"adrian-wang","id":3078910,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzg5MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3078910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang","html_url":"https://github.com/adrian-wang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/adrian-wang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdded new configuration namespace: spark.mesos.env.*\n\nThis allows a user submitting a job in cluster mode to set arbitrary environment variables on the driver.\nspark.mesos.driverEnv.KEY=VAL will result in the env var \"KEY\" being set to \"VAL\"\n\nI've also refactored the tests a bit so we can re-use code in MesosClusterScheduler.\n\nAnd I've refactored the command building logic in `buildDriverCommand`.  Command builder values were very intertwined before, and now it's easier to determine exactly how each variable is set.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nunit

to errors like this \n\n```\n\nIn [12]: filtered = df.filter(df['udt_time'] > threshold)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnalysisException

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFix parquet filter pushdown from not reaching all the way down to the file level\n\nUse of previous deprecated constructor defaults to null metadata, which\nprevents pushdown from reaching the Parquet level.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nLooking at output of collects from SparkShell, before were printing warnings about CorruptStatistics, preventing pushing down filters to individual parquet files. Now able to use the metadata in each file to pushdown.\n\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screenshot; otherwise, remove

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFor the web UI, this PR adds the raw SQL query text for each query in the new column \"SQL Text\" in the SQL Tab. To achieve this, it also passes the SQL text from the parser to the execution UI data, through the logical plan.\n\nIf the query has no related query text, show a blank in that field. If there is no query in the table has a query text, not show the column.\n\nIf the query text is long (i.e. longer than 140 chars), show the short abstract and display the full version on demand by the link \"+more\".\n\nIf the query text is too long (i.e. longer than 1000 chars), it will be truncated after parsing. This is to avoid downing browsers or web UI servers by running out of memory.\n\nAlso, a tooltip is added on the header \"SQL Text\", saying `Shows 140 characters by default. Click \"+more\" to see more. Long texts are truncated to 1000 characters. Left blank when the query was not issued by SQL.`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested by trying multiple SQL queries.\n\nA screenshot of the SQL Tab:\n![sqltextwithtooltip](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5558370/16863133/5ddb500c-4a15-11e6-9b08-e4ac160a0cd5.png)\n(Query 3 is identical to Query 2, but its SQL text is shown in detail

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSpark SQL doesn't have its own meta store yet, and use hive's currently. However, hive's meta store has some limitations(e.g. columns can't be too many, not case-preserving, bad decimal type support, etc.), so we have some hacks to successfully store data source table metadata into hive meta store, i.e. put all the information in table properties.\n\nThis PR moves these hacks to `HiveExternalCatalog`, tries to isolate hive specific logic in one place.\n\nchanges overview:\n1.  **before this PR**: we need to put metadata(schema, partition columns, etc.) of data source tables to table properties before saving it to external catalog, even the external catalog doesn't use hive metastore(e.g. `InMemoryCatalog`)\n   **after this PR**: the table properties tricks are only in `HiveExternalCatalog`, the caller side doesn't need to take care of it anymore.\n2. **before this PR**: because the table properties tricks are done outside of external catalog, so we also need to revert these tricks when we read the table metadata from external catalog and use it. e.g. in `DescribeTableCommand` we will read schema and partition columns from table properties.\n   **after this PR**: The table metadata read from external catalog is exactly the same with what we saved to it.\n\nbonus: now we can create data source table using `SessionCatalog`, if schema is specified.\nbreaks: `schemaStringLengthThreshold` is not configurable anymore. `hive.default.rcfile.serde` is not configurable anymore.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting tests.\n","created_at":"2016-07-12T14:11:12Z","updated_at":"2016-12-14T12:33:37Z","closed_at":"2016-08-22T05:25:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f630d562ad5917640e6e13080461342ee04ba278","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14155/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14155/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14155/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/38b838a9d27d5e11bad5f5e7040fe2d6d2e56216","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:catalog-table","ref":"catalog-table","sha":"38b838a9d27d5e11bad5f5e7040fe2d6d2e56216","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nbreeze 0.12 has been released for more than half a year, and it brings lots of new features, performance improvement and bug fixes.\nOne of the biggest features is `LBFGS-B` which is an implementation of `LBFGS` with box constraints and much faster for some special case.\nWe would like to implement Huber loss function for `LinearRegression` ([SPARK-3181](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-3181)) and it requires `LBFGS-B` as the optimization solver. So we should bump up the dependent breeze version to 0.12.\nFor more features, improvements and bug fixes of breeze 0.12, you can refer the following link:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-breeze/nEeRi_DcY5c\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNo new tests, should pass the existing ones.\n","created_at":"2016-07-12T08:54:36Z","updated_at":"2016-07-19T17:56:19Z","closed_at":"2016-07-19T11:33:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1ac7a734907dfcc2a7a7be481971435fbba3bb8b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14150/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14150/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14150/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dbfcbff6945dfd3e02180d95c4bccf7f5500e199","head":{"label":"yanboliang:spark-16494","ref":"spark-16494","sha":"dbfcbff6945dfd3e02180d95c4bccf7f5500e199","user":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21890948,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTg5MDk0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"yanboliang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently if `spark.dynamicAllocation.initialExecutors` is less than `spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors`, Spark will automatically pick the minExecutors without any warning. While in 1.6 Spark will throw exception if configured like this. So here propose to add warning log if these parameters are configured invalidly.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test added to verify the scenario.\n","created_at":"2016-07-12T08:31:55Z","updated_at":"2016-07-13T18:26:48Z","closed_at":"2016-07-13T18:26:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"751bb704c69a5d669af80ccce68daae6b4f824ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14149/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14149/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14149/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6dd2a86c443a8b36fc32dcb3370527989fc69b1f","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-16435","ref":"SPARK-16435","sha":"6dd2a86c443a8b36fc32dcb3370527989fc69b1f","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIf we create a table pointing to a parquet/json datasets without specifying the schema, describe table command does not show the schema at all. It only shows `# Schema of this table is inferred at runtime`. In 1.6, describe table does show the schema of such a table.\n\n~~For data source tables, to infer the schema, we need to load the data source tables at runtime. Thus, this PR calls the function `lookupRelation`.~~\n\nFor data source tables, we infer the schema before table creation. Thus, this PR set the inferred schema as the table schema when table creation.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn code generation, it is incorrect for expressions to reuse variable names across different instances of itself. As an example, SPARK-16488 reports a bug in which pmod expression reuses variable name \"r\".\n\nThis patch updates ExpressionEvalHelper test harness to always project two instances of the same expression, which will help us catch variable reuse problems in expression unit tests. This patch also fixes the bug in crc32 expression. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis is a test harness change, but I also created a new test suite for testing the test harness.\n","created_at":"2016-07-12T01:10:04Z","updated_at":"2016-07-12T17:09:15Z","closed_at":"2016-07-12T17:09:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"620e2294fcc10b55d0e008c9aa72e0d1ca79d775","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14146/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14146/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14146/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/222e868969c3f89ba62ebb97a6d99d046c00b6c8","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-16489","ref":"SPARK-16489","sha":"222e868969c3f89ba62ebb97a6d99d046c00b6c8","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn `JobGenerator`, the code reads like that some batches might not get marked as fully processed. In the following flowchart, the batch should get marked fully processed before endpoint C however it is not. Currently, this does not actually cause an issue, as the condition `(time - zeroTime) is multiple of checkpoint duration?` always evaluates to `true` as the `checkpoint duration` is always set to be equal to the `batch duration`.\n\n![Flowchart](https://s31.postimg.org/udy9lti2j/spark_streaming_job_generator.png)\n\nThis PR fixes this issue so as to improve code readability and to avoid any potential issue in case there is any future change making checkpoint duration to be set different from batch duration.\n","created_at":"2016-07-12T00:58:59Z","updated_at":"2016-07-22T11:41:24Z","closed_at":"2016-07-22T11:41:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2a24d04ce91448fec7c697095919a48536f10d30","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14145/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14145/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14145/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/585870f04cf93fcc663fd2b910c6bb1df3ef1dc5","head":{"label":"ahmed-mahran:b-mark-batch-fully-processed","ref":"b-mark-batch-fully-processed","sha":"585870f04cf93fcc663fd2b910c6bb1df3ef1dc5","user":{"login":"ahmed-mahran","id":8685962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODU5NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8685962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-mahran","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmed-mahran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-mahran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-mahran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-mahran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-mahran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-mahran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-mahran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-mahran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-mahran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-mahran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":37591448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzU5MTQ0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"ahmed-mahran/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ahmed-mahran","id":8685962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODU5NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8685962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-mahran","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmed-mahran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-mahran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-mahran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-mahran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-mahran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-mahran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-mahran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-mahran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-mahran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmed-mahran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ahmed-mahran/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSpark silently drops exceptions during file listing. This is a very bad behavior because it can mask legitimate errors and the resulting plan will silently have 0 rows. This patch changes it to not silently drop the errors.\n\nAfter making partition discovery not silently drop exceptions, HiveMetastoreCatalog can trigger partition discovery on empty tables, which cause FileNotFoundExceptions (these Exceptions were dropped by partition discovery silently). To address this issue, this PR introduces two **hacks** to workaround the issues. These two hacks try to avoid of triggering partition discovery on empty tables in HiveMetastoreCatalog.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually tested.\n\n**Note: This is a backport of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch implements reflect SQL function, which can be used to invoke a Java method in SQL. Slightly different from Hive, this implementation requires the class name and the method name to be literals. This implementation also supports only a smaller number of data types, and requires the function to be static, as suggested by @rxin in #13969.\n\njava_method is an alias for reflect, so this should also resolve SPARK-16277.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded expression unit tests and an end-to-end test.\n","created_at":"2016-07-11T18:05:13Z","updated_at":"2016-07-13T00:07:17Z","closed_at":"2016-07-13T00:07:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1f84cf0635ad262496bb4268e3dd4237567afe1b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14138/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14138/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14138/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b574c5d8abf93fcb34e7a2f88af14fdeb7d1bc66","head":{"label":"petermaxlee:reflect-static","ref":"reflect-static","sha":"b574c5d8abf93fcb34e7a2f88af14fdeb7d1bc66","user":{"login":"petermaxlee","id":20197098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk3MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20197098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee","html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62184923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjE4NDkyMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"petermaxlee/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"petermaxlee","id":20197098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk3MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20197098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee","html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nI added caching in every iteration for sccGraph that is returned in strongly connected components. Without this cache strongly connected components returned graph that needed to be computed from scratch when some intermediary caches didn't existed anymore. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI tested it by running code similar to the one  [on databrics](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/4889410027417133/3634650767364730/3117184429335832/latest.html). Basically I generated large graph  and computed strongly connected components with changed code, than simply run count on vertices and edges. Count after this update takes few seconds instead 20 minutes. \n# statement\n\ncontribution is my original work and I license the work to the project under the project's open source

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR aims to achieve the following two goals in Spark SQL.\n\n**1. Generic Hint Syntax**\nThe generic hints are parsed and transformed into concrete hints by `SubstituteHints` of **Analyzer**. The unknown hints are removed, too. For example, `Hint(\"MAPJOIN\")` is transformed into `BroadcastJoin` and other hints are removed currently.\n\n``` sql\nSELECT /*+ MAPJOIN(t) */ * FROM t\nSELECT /*+ STREAMTABLE(a,b,c) */ * FROM t\nSELECT /*+ INDEX(t emp_job_ix) */ * FROM t\n```\n\nUnlink Hive, `NEWMAPJOIN(t)` is allowed for accepting new Spark Hints.\n\n**2. Broadcast Hints**\nThe followings are recognized. Technically, broadcast hints are matched `UnresolvedRelation` to support Hive `MetastoreRelation`. The style of `database_name.table_name` is not allowed in this PR.\n\n``` sql\nSELECT /*+ MAPJOIN(t) */ * FROM t JOIN u ON t.id = u.id\nSELECT /*+ BROADCAST(u) */ * FROM t JOIN u ON t.id = u.id\nSELECT /*+ BROADCASTJOIN(u) */ * FROM t JOIN u ON t.id = u.id\n```\n\n**Examples**\n\n``` scala\nscala> spark.range(1000000000).createOrReplaceTempView(\"t\")\nscala>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIt is currently fairly difficult to have proper mima excludes when we cut a version branch. I'm proposing a small change to take the exclude list out of the exclude function, and put it in a variable so we can easily union excludes.\n\nAfter this change, we can bump pom.xml version to 2.1.0-SNAPSHOT, without bumping the diff base version. Note that I also deleted all the exclude rules for version 1.x, to cut down the size of the file.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nN/A - this is a build infra change.\n","created_at":"2016-07-11T01:18:29Z","updated_at":"2016-07-11T05:07:09Z","closed_at":"2016-07-11T05:07:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"77fc9b78c294f94637c31e94e9d6f2c7f1509209","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14128/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14128/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14128/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/86e9d128b29ec93c2cd0f360b83fdecc2813da20","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-16476","ref":"SPARK-16476","sha":"86e9d128b29ec93c2cd0f360b83fdecc2813da20","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror
