Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nLink to the original JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2335\r\n\r\nThis PR includes changes regarding where to store user related settings and the removal of the DataSource abstract class and its implementation called ElasticSearchLocalstorageImpl.\r\n\r\nWe understand the basic idea behind the concept of having an abstract class and its implementations but I believe that it was wrongly used and had many problems. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, in that case, having an interface instead of an abstract class would have been more appropriate. \r\n\r\nSecondly, the name of the implementation class is ElasticSearchLocalstorageImpl. Yes it persists data in the Browser's local storage but has nothing to do with Elasticsearch. Also, this frontend service should not know about the chosen tool on the backend side because it's irrelevant from this perspective. \r\n\r\nI believe that the original idea was to easily switch between approaches of storing this kind of data on the backend but since the frontend should not know about these details, it's not necessary to use this concept anymore.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you take a look at the implementation class (ElasticSearchLocalstorageImpl), there are methods which aren't required by the abstract class and they communicate with an http server directly in order to save or get alerts data. But these methods are unused, we rather get this data independently from the data source class however it was the original idea behind having it.\r\n\r\nLong story short, we decided to completely eliminate the DataSource class and its implementation and rather have a so-called UserSettingsService in order to get and store user specific settings on the backend. \r\n\r\nThey used to be stored in the browser's local storage but this approach works only on one computer but we would like the users to be able to get their desired settings on every computer they're logged in.\r\n\r\nThe following user settings are replaced from the local storage to Hbase:\r\n\r\n- time zone configuration\r\n- show/hide dismissed and resolved alserts\r\n- auto-polling settings\r\n- table configuration\r\n- saved and recently used saved searches\r\n\r\nWe decided to store everything simply in Hbase because it provides us the freedom to store basically anything without having backend work involved (declaring Java classes and additional Java properties, etc.).\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

running the Streaming Profiler in Storm, tuning the parallelism of each component requires a user to edit the Flux file at `$METRON_HOME/flux/profiler/remote.yaml`.  This change allows a user to tune the parallelism from within Ambari like the other topologies.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n1. Added a parameter to the MPack for tuning the Profiler's Spout parallelism.\r\n1. Added a parameter to the MPack for tuning the Profile's Splitter parallelism.\r\n1. Added a parameter to the MPack for tuning the Profile's Builder parallelism.\r\n1. Added a parameter to the MPack for tuning the Profiler's Kafka Writer parallelism.\r\n1. Added a parameter to the MPack for tuning the Profiler's HBase Writer parallelism.\r\n1. Updated the documentation for each of these new parameters.\r\n1. Renamed `profiler.executors` to `profiler.acker.executors` as this more accurately reflects the use of this parameter.\r\n\r\n## Try It Out\r\n\r\n1. Launch the development environment.\r\n\r\n1. Kill the Profiler\r\n    ```\r\n    storm kill profiler -w 0\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Go to Ambari > Metron > Config > Profiler.\r\n\r\n    * Reduce the Profile Period to 1 minute.\r\n\r\n    * Alter the Spout, Splitter, Builder, Kafka Writer, and HBase Writer parallelism values to something other than the default of 1.\r\n    \r\n    ![Screen Shot 2019-12-04 at 6 37 49 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/70191025-7e351d80-16c5-11ea-98c0-64b684c94463.png)\r\n\r\n1. Restart the Profiler.\r\n\r\n1. Open the Storm UI and ensure the parallelism values were accepted by Storm.\r\n\r\n    ![Screen Shot 2019-12-04 at 6 38 05 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/70190971-62317c00-16c5-11ea-86e0-9a997d037fbd.png)\r\n\r\n1. Test a profile in the REPL according to [these instructions](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-analytics/metron-profiler-repl#getting-started).\r\n\r\n1. Deploy that profile to the Streaming Profiler in Storm.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"PROFILER\", conf)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Wait for the Streaming Profiler in Storm to flush and retrieve the measurement from HBase.  \r\n\r\n    Retrieve the measurement from HBase.  Prior to this PR, it was not possible to query HBase from the REPL.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"hello-world\",\"global\", PROFILE_FIXED(30, \"DAYS\"))\r\n    [1611, 420, 405, 435, 435, 420, 450]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

should focus on improving our CI builds to catch as many problems as possible and rely less on manual testing and due diligence. \r\n\r\nOne gap we have now is that if a change is submitted that breaks the RPMs, the CI build will not detect the problem.  This kind of problem can only be detected by relying on our contributors and committers to dutifully run-up the development environment.  \r\n\r\nThis change allows for the RPMs to be built as part of the Travis CI build. If the RPMs fail to build, the Travis CI build should fail.\r\n\r\n#### Point to Consider for Reviewers\r\n\r\nBuilding the RPMs requires a complete build of Metron.  This will likely push our backs up against the 50 minute time window allowed by Travis. #1522 gave us some breathing room by shuffling what we build and when, but did not fundamentally solve that problem.\r\n\r\n If this change risks causing numerous intermittent test failures due to timeouts, I'd prefer to hold this change until that problem can be addressed.  I will confirm whether this is a problem and comment later on this PR.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nThis adds an additional step \"Build RPMs\" that builds the Metron RPMs in parallel with the other build and validation steps.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Break the RPM build by modifying the metron.spec.\r\n1. Ensure the Travis CI build fail.\r\n1. Fix the `metron.spec`.\r\n1. Ensure the Travis CI build runs succecssfully.\r\n\r\nSee the following Travis builds.\r\n* https://travis-ci.org/apache/metron/builds/619846316\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Threat Triage Rule's \"reason\" field can contain executable Stellar to provide an operator context as to why a rule fired during Threat Triage.  This \"reason\" field is unable to call any function that requires a `StellarContext` during initialization.  For example, I cannot call the function `ENRICHMENT_GET`.\r\n\r\n## Root Cause\r\n\r\nThere is some additional Stellar validation performed on a threat triage rule's reason and rule field in `ThreatTriageConfig.setRiskLevelRules`.  In this validation, no `StellarContext` is initialized which causes the `ENRICHMENT_GET` function to fail as described.\r\n\r\n## The Fix\r\n\r\nThis validation is incorrectly throwing exceptions in cases like this where the user has provided a valid Stellar expression. This is because the Stellar execution environment is not configured and initialized in the same manner as the one used to actually run the Threat Triage rules at run-time.\r\n\r\nI have found that the additional validation in `ThreatTriageConfig.setRiskLevelRules` is redundant. There are no error conditions that this validation would catch that would not be caught by validation performed elsewhere. \r\n\r\n1. Any error condition discoverable at 'compile-time' is checked before the triage rule is loaded into Zk.  If the user attempts to load invalid rules using the REPL or `zk_load_configs`, all 'compile-time' errors that `ThreatTriageConfig.setRiskLevelRules` might catch, are already caught. \r\n\r\n    For example, if the \"reason\" expression calls a non-existent function or uses invalid syntax, an exception will be thrown and the rule will not load. \r\n\r\n2. Any other 'run-time' errors can only be checked when a message's fields are available to the expression.  These sorts of errors would not be caught by the validation in `ThreatTriageConfig.setRiskLevelRules` and instead will be caught by the `ThreatTriageProcessor`.\r\n\r\n    For example, if the \"reason\" expression refers to a field that does not exist or attempts to divide by a field that has a value of 0.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n1. Remove the validation of Stellar expressions from `ThreatTriageConfig.setRiskLevelRules`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\n1. Spin-up the development environment.\r\n\r\n1. Turn off all sensor-stubs except snort.\r\n    ```\r\n    service sensor-stubs stop\r\n    service sensor-stubs start snort\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create a file called `user.csv`.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# cat user.csv\r\n    jdoe,192.168.138.2\r\n    jane,192.168.66.1\r\n    ciana,192.168.138.158\r\n    danixa,95.163.121.204\r\n    jim,192.168.66.121\r\n    ```\r\n  \r\n1. Create a file called `user-extractor.json`.\r\n    ```\r\n    {\r\n      \"config\": {\r\n        \"columns\": {\r\n          \"user\": 0,\r\n          \"ip\": 1\r\n        },\r\n        \"indicator_column\": \"ip\",\r\n        \"separator\": \",\",\r\n        \"type\": \"user\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"extractor\": \"CSV\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Import the data that we will use for enrichment.\r\n    ```\r\n    source /etc/default/metron\r\n    $METRON_HOME/bin/flatfile_loader.sh -i ./user.csv -t enrichment -c t -e ./user-extractor.json\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Validate that the enrichment loaded successfully.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 0.7.2]# source /etc/default/metron\r\n    [root@node1 0.7.2]# $METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n    \r\n    [Stellar]>>> ip_dst_addr := \"192.168.138.2\"\r\n    192.168.138.2\r\n    \r\n    [Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_GET('user', ip_dst_addr, 'enrichment', 't')\r\n    {ip=192.168.138.2, user=jdoe}\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create a threat triage rule that attempts an ENRICHMENT_GET.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT()\r\n    {\r\n      \"enrichment\": {\r\n        \"fieldMap\": {\r\n          \"stellar\": {\r\n            \"config\": {\r\n              \"is_alert\": \"true\"\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"fieldToTypeMap\": {},\r\n        \"config\": {}\r\n      },\r\n      \"threatIntel\": {\r\n        \"fieldMap\": {},\r\n        \"fieldToTypeMap\": {},\r\n        \"config\": {},\r\n        \"triageConfig\": {\r\n          \"riskLevelRules\": [\r\n            {\r\n              \"name\": \"Rule1\",\r\n              \"comment\": \"This rule should work.\",\r\n              \"rule\": \"true\",\r\n              \"reason\": \"FORMAT('Call to ENRICHMENT_GET=%s', ENRICHMENT_GET('user', ip_dst_addr, 'enrichment', 't'))\",\r\n              \"score\": \"100\"\r\n            }\r\n          ],\r\n          \"aggregator\": \"MAX\",\r\n          \"aggregationConfig\": {}\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      \"configuration\": {}\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"ENRICHMENT\", conf, \"snort\")\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that the snort telemetry contains a reason field with the enriched value.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_TAIL( \"indexing\", 10)\r\n    [{...\r\n      \"threat.triage.rules.0.reason\":\"Call to ENRICHMENT_GET={ip=192.168.138.158, user=ciana}\"\r\n      }]\r\n    ```\r\n* As a side note, you should **not** embed a call to `ENRICHMENT_GET` in your risk level rules like this.  This kind of call to an external platform like HBase should be done as part of Enrichment and then the field can be referred to from your risk level rules.  I added some documentation about this.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nLink to ASF Jira ticket: https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2325\r\n\r\nAfter a user creates a parser group and tries to edit the details of the group, the name input becomes readonly. However, we have a keyup event that's active and causes the existing group validation message to appear.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"626\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-11-20 at 6 23 28 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/69290015-16121200-0bc4-11ea-9a45-0a686c68e801.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nSince we do not receive validation messages in other parts of the UI where we have a readonly field, I simply disabled the validation message once the group is created.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nOpen up the Management UI and try grouping together two parsers by drag and dropping one onto another. Create a group. Now, try to edit that group by clicking on the pencil icon in the group's row. Try clicking on the name field. It should be readonly and no validation message should appear.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nDiscovered in #1554\r\n\r\nTravis should work the same as local now. Couple changes happened\r\n  - Readded JUnit dep, since it does occur as part of metron-integration-test\r\n  - Run a build step before verify is called\r\n  - Adjusted the npm scripts to not fail if we provide `-Dskip.npm`. This ensures that all the modules are built for the verify, but we don't bother with anything related to npm.\r\n  - Adjusted the build scripts to properly relay issues if maven fails. We could probably add various quiet options to maven if we want.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThe alerts list component is one of the largest components in the Alerts UI. It is also really tightly coupled with the query builder at the moment. In order to maintain and, hopefully, refactor this area of the app in the future, I've increased the unit test coverage for the alerts list component.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nRun unit tests and generate a coverage report for the Alerts UI by running `npm run test -- --code-coverage`. You can refer to the report for the percentage of increased coverage, and manually verify by taking a look at alert-list.component.spec.ts.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1454\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-11-19 at 7 48 26 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/69202255-adb12b00-0b06-11ea-9b12-1e1d519e9666.png\">\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

automated AWS deployment mechanism (`metron-deployment/amazon-ec2`) should be removed.  It is no longer the preferred installation path for deploying to AWS.\r\n\r\nThere are many problems with maintaining this deployment method.\r\n* It deploys an insecure cluster by default.\r\n* It produces a cluster that does not survive a reboot. \r\n* It is difficult for the the community to support a code path that is not free.\r\n* This is a point-of-confusion for new Metron users.\r\n* This is no longer the preferred installation path for AWS. \r\n\r\nIf a user wants to deploy to AWS, they should launch their EC2 nodes, install Ambari, and then using the MPack to deploy Metron.  That is the preferred installation path for AWS.\r\n\r\nThis has been discussed on the mailing list.\r\n* https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/4ba83a634a10ecc9380d4592a6fe568dfaf6a1b5da433cc84b129e6a@%3Cdev.metron.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\nThis PR can be tested using the centos6 development environment.  Ensure that we can continue to parse, enrich, and index telemetry.  Verify data is flowing through the system, from parsing to indexing\r\n\r\n1. Build the site-book and review its output.\r\n    ```\r\n    cd site-book\r\n    mvn clean site\r\n    open target/site/index.html\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Start up the centos6 dev environment.\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/development/centos6\r\n    vagrant destroy -f\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Open Ambari and navigate to the Metron service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/METRON/summary\r\n\r\n1. Open the Alerts UI.  Verify alerts show up in the main UI - click the search icon (you may need to wait a moment for them to appear)\r\n\r\n1. Go to the Alerts UI and ensure that an ever increasing number of telemetry from Bro, Snort, and YAF are visible by watching the total alert count increase over time.\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that geoip enrichment is occurring.  The telemetry should contain fields like `enrichments:geo:ip_src_addr:location_point`.\r\n\r\n1. Head back to Ambari and select the Kibana service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/KIBANA/summary\r\n\r\n1. Open the Kibana dashboard via the \"Metron UI\" option in the quick links\r\n\r\n1. Verify the dashboard is populating\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

This was prior to the changes introduced by #1556, which switched to Kryo serialization. \r\n\r\nSpark's bean encoder does not handle serialization of an `Object` well; it fails to serialize successfully in many cases. The value of a `ProfileMeasurement` is stored as a `java.lang.Object` because it can be the result of any Stellar expression.  We have no knowledge of its type until runtime.  \r\n\r\nTo be able to store the profile measurement value using Spark's bean encoder, a `ProfileMeasurementAdapter` was created so that the value can be serialized into bytes using Metron's `SerDeUtils`, before Spark's serialization occurs.  \r\n\r\nThis work around worked for most cases, but for others the serialization being performed by `SerDeUtils` was conflicting with Spark's own serialization.  This prevented the Batch Profiler from persisting a data sketch.\r\n\r\nThe fix for this bug requires the changes made in #1556 along with the changes here which remove the \"work around\" for Spark's bean encoder.  Now, we can just rely on Kryo to serialize our data sketches successfully, just as is done in the Streaming Profiler.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n1. Removed the `ProfileMeasurementAdapter` as this was only needed as a work around for  Spark's bean encoder.\r\n\r\n1. Replaced all uses of `ProfileMeasurementAdapter` with `ProfileMeasurement`.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\nThis PR can be tested using the centos6 development environment.\r\n\r\n1. Start up the centos6 dev environment.\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/development/centos7\r\n    vagrant destroy -f\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Allow the environment to run a few minutes to ensure that there is telemetry archived in HDFS that can be used by the Batch Profiler.\r\n\r\n### Setup the Batch Profiler\r\n\r\n1. In Ambari, stop Metron and Sensor-Stubs to free-up resources.\r\n\r\n1. Install Spark2 using Ambari.\r\n\r\n1. Install the MySQL Connector and ensure Ambari can find it.\r\n   ```\r\n   yum -y install mysql-connector-java\r\n   ln -s /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar /var/lib/ambari-server/resources/mysql-connector-java.jar\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n1. Install Spark2 using Ambari. YARN must be kept running for the install to complete successfully.\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that Spark can talk with HBase.\r\n    ```\r\n    cp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml /etc/spark2/conf/\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Create a Profile\r\n\r\n1. Create the following profile in `config/zookeeper/profiler.json`.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 0.7.2]# cat config/zookeeper/profiler.json\r\n    {\r\n      \"profiles\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"profile\": \"profile-using-stats\",\r\n          \"onlyif\": \"exists(parallelenricher.enrich.end.ts) and exists(parallelenricher.enrich.begin.ts)\",\r\n          \"foreach\": \"ip_src_addr\",\r\n          \"update\": {\r\n    \t\"duration\": \"TO_LONG(parallelenricher.enrich.end.ts) - TO_LONG(parallelenricher.enrich.begin.ts)\",\r\n    \t\"sketch\": \"STATS_ADD(sketch, duration)\" },\r\n          \"result\": \"sketch\"\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"timestampField\":\"timestamp\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Run the Batch Profiler.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 0.7.2]# ./bin/start_batch_profiler.sh\r\n    ...\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:13 DEBUG DefaultProfileBuilder: Applying message to profile; profile=profile-using-stats, entity=72.34.49.86, timestamp=1573666545000\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:13 DEBUG DefaultMessageDistributor: About to flush active profiles\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:13 DEBUG DefaultMessageDistributor: Active cache maintenance triggered: cacheStats=CacheStats{hitCount=66, missCount=1, loadSuccessCount=1, loadFailureCount=0, totalLoadTime=12810, evictionCount=0, evictionWeight=0}, size=1\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:13 DEBUG DefaultMessageDistributor: Expired cache maintenance triggered: cacheStats=CacheStats{hitCount=0, missCount=0, loadSuccessCount=0, loadFailureCount=0, totalLoadTime=0, evictionCount=0, evictionWeight=0}, size=0\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:13 DEBUG DefaultProfileBuilder: Flushed profile: profile=profile-using-stats, entity=72.34.49.86, maxTime=1573666545000, period=1748518, start=1573666200000, end=1573667100000, duration=900000\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:13 DEBUG ProfileBuilderFunction: Profile measurement created; profile=profile-using-stats, entity=72.34.49.86, period=1748518, value=org.apache.metron.statistics.OnlineStatisticsProvider@4b3d7611\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:13 DEBUG BatchProfiler: Produced 27 profile measurement(s)\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:13 DEBUG HBaseWriterFunction: About to write profile measurement(s) to HBase\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:15 DEBUG HBaseWriterFunction: 3 profile measurement(s) written to HBase\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:15 DEBUG HBaseWriterFunction: About to write profile measurement(s) to HBase\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:15 DEBUG HBaseWriterFunction: 2 profile measurement(s) written to HBase\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:15 DEBUG HBaseWriterFunction: About to write profile measurement(s) to HBase\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:15 DEBUG HBaseWriterFunction: 3 profile measurement(s) written to HBase\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:15 DEBUG HBaseWriterFunction: About to write profile measurement(s) to HBase\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:15 DEBUG HBaseWriterFunction: 0 profile measurement(s) written to HBase\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:15 DEBUG HBaseWriterFunction: About to write profile measurement(s) to HBase\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:15 DEBUG HBaseWriterFunction: 0 profile measurement(s) written to HBase\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:15 DEBUG HBaseWriterFunction: About to write profile measurement(s) to HBase\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:15 DEBUG HBaseWriterFunction: 2 profile measurement(s) written to HBase\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:15 DEBUG HBaseWriterFunction: About to write profile measurement(s) to HBase\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:15 DEBUG HBaseWriterFunction: 4 profile measurement(s) written to HBase\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:15 DEBUG HBaseWriterFunction: About to write profile measurement(s) to HBase\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:15 DEBUG HBaseWriterFunction: 3 profile measurement(s) written to HBase\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:15 DEBUG HBaseWriterFunction: About to write profile measurement(s) to HBase\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:15 DEBUG HBaseWriterFunction: 5 profile measurement(s) written to HBase\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:15 DEBUG HBaseWriterFunction: About to write profile measurement(s) to HBase\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:15 DEBUG HBaseWriterFunction: 5 profile measurement(s) written to HBase\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:15 DEBUG BatchProfiler: 27 profile measurement(s) written to HBase\r\n    19/11/15 23:16:15 INFO BatchProfilerCLI: Profiler produced 27 profile measurement(s)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1.

Contributor Comments\r\nLink to ASF Jira ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2318\r\n\r\nThe feature branch is once again out-of-date, and there are many conflicts to resolve. For this reason, a pull request is being opened to keep resolved conflicts separate from other work in the branch.\r\n\r\nNote: Due to the way we had to cherry-pick our work, way more commits are appearing than are actually part of this set of work. The only commit belonging to this PR is the last commit in this change set.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nEverything should build and test fine, as it does on master. I was able to build full-dev and run tests via the mvn command in the checklist.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nAs part of this PR, I'm fixing the layout of the metron confirmation dialogue.\r\nThe problems with the layout were the followings:\r\n- Close icon shifted to the left of the title and get positioned to the center of the dialogue windows\r\n- bottom and the top gap around the confirmation message was bigger than on other views\r\n- Cancel button text turned to black on mouseover and made the 'Cancel' label disappearing\r\n\r\n![image-2019-11-13-13-13-29-518](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2437400/69067913-34410c00-0a24-11ea-8c55-540ab774611f.png)\r\n\r\nThe same dialog with the

Contributor Comments\r\nCouple things\r\n- added JUnit exclusions into all the uber jars. For dependencies on `hbase-shaded-client` these exclusions are on a class level, rather than a dependency level. I believe this is because of the shaded jar's construction, but I'm open to suggestions\r\n  - JUnit 4 and 5 are included, so I'm not redoing half the work in #1554 and because it doesn't hurt anything\r\n- Added exclusions on `json-simple`, which pulls JUnit in as default (compile) scope.\r\n- `dependencies_with_url.csv` updated to drop JUnit.\r\n- Updated `StellarProcessorUtils.java` to remove JUnit from `src` in favor of throwing `AssertionError`. I'm not convinced that a subclass of `Error` is the appropriate thing to do, but it's the underlying JUnit does, so I basically just moved that semantic into our code for this purpose.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nLink to the ASF Jira ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2316\r\n\r\nCurrently, the users are able to change the order of the columns in the alerts list table by clicking the arrow buttons on the right side of each list item (in the configure table pane). \r\nBut it would be more comfortable if we allowed the user to rearrange the columns by using drag and drop.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces this capability of the Alerts UI application.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n=====\r\n\r\n1. Go to the Alerts UI and somehow generate a list of alerts on the screen\r\n2. Click on the cog icon above the table, on the top right corner\r\n3. Grab a column item on the left side of the pane\r\n4. Put it somewhere else in the list (at the beginning, at the end, somewhere between the two)\r\n5. You can also add new columns to the list from the right side of the pane\r\n6. Try to rearrange the columns on the left involving the newly added columns\r\n\r\nDemo\r\n====\r\n\r\n![Kapture 2019-11-15 at 14 12 02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2196208/68946024-31d77b80-07b2-11ea-88b5-5565f64df964.gif)\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

The purpose of `slf4j-log4j12` is intended to redirect calls made to an SLF4J logger to Log4j. The purpose of `log4j-over-slf4j` is to redirect calls made to a Log4j logger to SLF4J. Pulling in both would cause endless indirection except for the specific check for this error performed by SLF4j.  See  [the SLF4j documentation here](http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#log4jDelegationLoop) for more information.\r\n\r\nThe `metron-indexing-storm` project was pulling in `log4j-over-slf4j` incorrectly as a transitive.  This needs to be explicitly excluded.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\nThe integration tests should pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? If not one needs to be created at [Metron Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel).\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with METRON-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve?

Contributor Comments\r\nCame out of debugging https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1554, and was worth pulling out separately.\r\n\r\nI had to add in `elasticsearch-rest-high-level-client` to `metron-elasticsearch-storm` since it seems that it was coming from `metron-integration-test` and indexing and REST both failed to deal with ES properly otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis seems to reduce the size of `metron-elasticsearch-storm` jar by ~20M.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development

The Problem \r\n\r\nSome profile \"update\" expressions execute incorrectly in the Batch Profiler. The bug report provides an example where a call to `IS_EMPTY` returns true, when it should be returning false when the profile is executed by the Batch Profiler.  The same profile executed in the REPL or in the Streaming Profiler, returns the expected result.\r\n\r\n### Root Cause\r\n\r\nThe values contained within a telemetry message are exposed to a profile's update expression at runtime.  This allows the profile to refer to message fields by name.  \r\n\r\nAfter message routing occurs, the telemetry message is corrupted during serialization. It appears that all type information is lost when the corruption occurs.  This causes variable resolution for message fields to fail when executing a profile’s ‘update’ expression.  \r\n* This does not impact variables defined within the profile itself. \r\n* This does not impact the ‘onlyif’, ‘foreach’, ‘init’, and 'result' expressions of a profile; only the 'update' expression.\r\n\r\nThe corruption occurs when a `MessageRoute` is serialized. This only affects the `JSONObject` representing the telemetry message, rather than any other fields like the profile definition, entity, or timestamp data also contained within a `MessageRoute`. \r\n \r\nThe `MapVariableResolver` is passed the corrupted `JSONObject` so that variables can be resolved from the fields contained within the message.  Due to the corruption variables referring to the message are not resolved.\r\n\r\nThe corruption is caused by the use of Spark's bean encoder when serializing `MessageRoute` objects. \r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* Rather than using the bean encoder, I opted to use the Kryo encoder, which correctly serializes the objects.\r\n* Added test cases for the defect.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\n1. Create a profile like the following. We expect the profile to return false in all cases due to the `onlyif` expression.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@ctr-e141-1563959304486-71855-01-000003 metron]# cat config/zookeeper/profiler.json\r\n    {\r\n     \"profiles\":[\r\n       {\r\n         \"profile\":\"is-empty\",\r\n         \"onlyif\":\"devicehostname == 'windows9.something.com'\",\r\n         \"foreach\":\"devicehostname\",\r\n         \"init\":{\r\n         },\r\n         \"update\":{\r\n           \"val\":\"IS_EMPTY(devicehostname)\"\r\n         },\r\n        \"result\":{\r\n           \"profile\":\"val\"\r\n        }\r\n       }\r\n     ],\r\n     \"timestampField\":\"timestamp\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create some sample data to feed the profile.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@ctr-e141-1563959304486-71855-01-000003 metron]# cat /tmp/test_data.logs\r\n    {\"devicehostname\": \"windows9.something.com\", \"timestamp\": 1567241981000, \"source.type\": \"testsource\"}\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Configure the Batch Profiler to read the sample data.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@ctr-e141-1563959304486-71855-01-000003 metron]# cat config/batch-profiler.properties\r\n    spark.app.name=Batch Profiler\r\n    spark.master=local\r\n    spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=1\r\n\r\n    profiler.batch.input.path=file:///tmp/test_data.logs\r\n    profiler.batch.input.format=json\r\n\r\n    profiler.period.duration=1\r\n    profiler.period.duration.units=MINUTES\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Adjust the Spark logging. I prefer root logger at ERROR and the Batch Profiler set to DEBUG.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@ctr-e141-1563959304486-71855-01-000003 metron]# cat /usr/hdp/current/spark2-client/conf/log4j.properties\r\n\r\n    # Set everything to be logged to the console\r\n    log4j.rootCategory=ERROR, console\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    log4j.logger.org.apache.metron.profiler.spark=DEBUG\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Run the Batch Profiler.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@ctr-e141-1563959304486-71855-01-000003 metron]# source /etc/default/metron\r\n    [root@ctr-e141-1563959304486-71855-01-000003 metron]# ./bin/start_batch_profiler.sh\r\n    Warning: Ignoring non-spark config property: profiler.batch.input.path=hdfs://ctr-e141-1563959304486-71855-01-000005.hwx.site:8020/apps/metron/indexing/indexed/*/*\r\n    Warning: Ignoring non-spark config property: profiler.period.duration=1\r\n    Warning: Ignoring non-spark config property: profiler.period.duration.units=MINUTES\r\n    Warning: Ignoring non-spark config property: profiler.batch.input.format=text\r\n    ...\r\n    19/11/08 20:18:33 DEBUG BatchProfiler: Generated 1 message route(s)\r\n    19/11/08 20:18:34 DEBUG ProfileBuilderFunction: Building a profile for group 'is-empty__windows9.something.com__26120699' from 1 message(s)\r\n    19/11/08 20:18:34 DEBUG ProfileBuilderFunction: Profile measurement created; profile=is-empty, entity=windows9.something.com, period=26120699, value=false\r\n    19/11/08 20:18:34 DEBUG BatchProfiler: Produced 1 profile measurement(s)\r\n    19/11/08 20:18:34 DEBUG HBaseWriterFunction: About to write profile measurement(s) to HBase\r\n    19/11/08 20:18:36 DEBUG HBaseWriterFunction: 1 profile measurement(s) written to HBase\r\n    19/11/08 20:18:36 DEBUG BatchProfiler: 1 profile measurement(s) written to HBase\r\n    19/11/08 20:18:36 INFO BatchProfilerCLI: Profiler produced 1 profile measurement(s)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    The following log statement shows the expression `IS_EMPTY(devicehostname)` is indeed false as we would expect.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    19/11/08 20:18:34 DEBUG ProfileBuilderFunction: Profile measurement created; profile=is-empty, entity=windows9.something.com, period=26120699, value=false\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nMoves to JUnit 5. This came out of my forever ago desire to look into JUnit5 extensions to share test infra (Kafka, ZK, etc.) across our test classes, rather than spin up for each class.\r\n\r\n- Migrates everything to JUnit5 annotations.\r\n- Migrates everything to JUnit5 assertions. This includes making everything `assertThrows`\r\n- The only `@Rule`s left are for temporary directories. This feature is experimental in JUnit5 (although I do use it once for a `@ClassRule` one.  We could potentially migrate over, it's not like it'd be a huge deal to upgrade to whatever they choose in the future.\r\n- PowerMock is gone. Doesn't work in JUnit 5. Various methods are added to source to be able to mock out / spy on / whatever to get it to work. Tried to be pretty minimal about this change, since it hits outside of tests.\r\n- I believe a single test got deleted: One for a two line method in `MetronRestApplication`, iirc. Didn't seem super helpful to test that it ran the `SpringApplication`.\r\n \r\nBuild works (potentially barring the last couple cleanup commits which are going through my personal Travis), but I still need to spin it up on dev.\r\n\r\nI'm not super thrilled about this being a large PR, but it was an enormous pain that kept finding things backwards in modules I thought I'd already cleared. It could probably be split out, but I'll be honest: If I see that request, I'll probably ignore it for awhile.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nLink to original ASF Jira ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2306\r\n\r\nCurrently, when a user opens a Grok parser config in the Management UI, they are presented with two inputs for the timestampField field. The first is an input labelled ‘Timestamp’:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"305\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-11-02 at 1 42 30 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/68075531-cbe10200-fd76-11e9-8ba5-ff6d0d40f528.png\">\r\n\r\nThis input was added recently because Grok parsers require you to have a timestampField attribute. You can read more about it here: https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1393\r\n\r\nThe second is under the Parser Config section of the side panel:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"297\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-11-02 at 1 43 18 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/68075534-d0a5b600-fd76-11e9-9ab1-2bf06ec10704.png\">\r\n\r\nThis section is a form representation of the parserConfig property that is returned from the REST API once a parser exists. It is fully editable by the user.\r\n\r\nNaturally, some confusion has come up around where a user manages this field. The first mentioned field defaults to ‘timestamp’, but does not populate a value on an existing parser since that value is returned from the API in the parserConfig object.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I’ve removed the first mentioned field altogether, and instead upon creation I’m defaulting to the field value ‘timestamp’ in the parserConfig object. If a user tries to remove the timestampField from the config object, the submit button becomes disabled. Unfortunately, adding a validation message is not something I've done yet. This would require more work due to the current nested structure of the parserConfig form. Before I continue with this work, I think we should actually discuss a better solution.\r\n\r\nI think the best way to fix this is to actually change the backend so that Grok parsers have and require a property for `timestampField`. I think this because, as mentioned above, the current implementation in the UI allows users to create, update and delete any property in the parserConfig object. If `timestampField` is actually a requirement for Grok parsers, I do not think this property should be part of this object, as it is currently.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

change includes a few clean-up items that are needed prior to the `feature/METRON-2088-support-hdp-3.1` feature branch being merged into master.  I validated each of the component versions that we are building against to ensure they match against [HDP-3.1](https://docs.cloudera.com/HDPDocuments/HDP3/HDP-3.1.0/release-notes/content/comp_versions.html).\r\n\r\nEach of these changes are included in separate commits to make review a bit simpler.  These include.\r\n\r\n* Removed the legacy `HDP-2.5.0.0` profile from the root POM.\r\n* Changed the Spark dependency from 2.3.1 to 2.3.2 to match HDP-3.1\r\n* Removed a `storm-kafka` dependency from the root POM that was never needed.\r\n* Moved all properties defining versions of core platform components to the `HDP-3.1` profile.\r\n* Reorganized existing version properties into separate sections for (1) build dependencies (2) test dependencies and (3) build tooling\r\n* Removed unused properties.\r\n* Pulled out some of the build tooling versions into properties to match what we had done in other places.  \r\n\r\nI validated this by comparing the version numbers output by `mvn dependency:tree` from before and after the change.  The only version changes introduced by this PR involve the Spark change. This in addition to the basic acceptance testing were used to validate the change.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to break any of these changes out into separate PRs should a reviewer think that is needed.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\nThis PR should be tested using the centos7 development environment.  \r\n\r\n1. Start up the centos7 dev environment.\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/development/centos7\r\n    vagrant destroy -f\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Basic Indexing and Enrichment\r\n\r\nEnsure that we can continue to parse, enrich, and index telemetry.  Verify data is flowing through the system, from parsing to indexing\r\n\r\n1. Open Ambari and navigate to the Metron service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/METRON/summary\r\n\r\n1. Open the Alerts UI.  Verify alerts show up in the main UI - click the search icon (you may need to wait a moment for them to appear)\r\n\r\n1. Go to the Alerts UI and ensure that an ever increasing number of telemetry from Bro, Snort, and YAF are visible by watching the total alert count increase over time.\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that geoip enrichment is occurring.  The telemetry should contain fields like `enrichments:geo:ip_src_addr:location_point`.\r\n\r\n1. Head back to Ambari and select the Kibana service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/KIBANA/summary\r\n\r\n1. Open the Kibana dashboard via the \"Metron UI\" option in the quick links\r\n\r\n1. Verify the dashboard is populating\r\n\r\n#### Batch Profiler\r\n\r\n1. Install Spark2 using Ambari.\r\n\r\n    1. Stop Metron and Sensor-Stubs to free-up resources.\r\n\r\n    1. Install the MySQL Connector and ensure Ambari can find it.\r\n       ``` \r\n       yum -y install mysql-connector-java\r\n       ln -s /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar /var/lib/ambari-server/resources/mysql-connector-java.jar\r\n       ```\r\n\r\n    1. Install Spark2 using Ambari. YARN must be kept running for the install to complete successfully.\r\n\r\n    1. Ensure that Spark can talk with HBase.\r\n        ```\r\n        cp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml /etc/spark2/conf/\r\n        ```\r\n\r\n1. Use the Batch Profiler to back-fill your profile.  To do this, follow the direction [provided here](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-analytics/metron-profiler-spark#getting-started).\r\n\r\n1. Retrieve the entire profile, including the back-filled data.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"hello-world\", \"global\", PROFILE_FIXED(30, \"DAYS\"))\r\n    [1203, 2849, 2900, 1944, 1054, 1241, 1721]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nLink to ASF ticket here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2304\r\n\r\nWe are currently using node 9.11.1 and npm 6.2.0 in the project (this is specified in both the Alerts UI and Management UI pom.xml files). This version of node is no longer supported. [Per Node.js' documents](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/), \"Production applications should only use Active LTS or Maintenance LTS releases.\" \r\n\r\nIn this PR, I updated the project to use the current active LTS release (10.17.0). I also updated the npm version to the latest minor/patch release (6.11.3).\r\n\r\nIn addition, I added an .nvmrc file to the Management UI so that local developers using nvm will be able to use the same version as our production build.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nThere shouldn't be a noticeable difference since node v10 is just the LTS release of v9. If you run `mvn install -pl ':metron-config'` and `mvn install -pl ':metron-alerts'`, you will notice the versions of node and npm mentioned above are installed. The tests suites for both UIs will also be ran and should pass. To visually test for regressions, spin up full dev and open both the Alerts and Management UI. You should see no differences.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

`metron-storm-kafka-overrides` project contains some overridden `storm-kafka` classes that were necessary to address a performance issues in older versions of `storm-kafka`.  Now that we have upgraded to Storm 1.2.1 these fixes are included in the code base and the overrides are no longer needed. \r\n\r\nI have validated that the version of `storm-kafka` we now build against matches the overrides we had in place for the following classes.\r\n* org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/KafkaSpoutRetryExponentialBackoff.java\r\n* org/apache/storm/kafka/spout/internal/Timer.java\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\nThis PR should be tested using the centos7 development environment.  \r\n\r\n1. Start up the centos7 dev environment.\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/development/centos7\r\n    vagrant destroy -f\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Basic Indexing and Enrichment\r\n\r\nEnsure that we can continue to parse, enrich, and index telemetry.  Verify data is flowing through the system, from parsing to indexing\r\n\r\n1. Open Ambari and navigate to the Metron service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/METRON/summary\r\n\r\n1. Open the Alerts UI.  Verify alerts show up in the main UI - click the search icon (you may need to wait a moment for them to appear)\r\n\r\n1. Go to the Alerts UI and ensure that an ever increasing number of telemetry from Bro, Snort, and YAF are visible by watching the total alert count increase over time.\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that geoip enrichment is occurring.  The telemetry should contain fields like `enrichments:geo:ip_src_addr:location_point`.\r\n\r\n1. Head back to Ambari and select the Kibana service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/KIBANA/summary\r\n\r\n1. Open the Kibana dashboard via the \"Metron UI\" option in the quick links\r\n\r\n1. Verify the dashboard is populating\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

we upgraded to Storm 1.2.1, we did not update the version of Storm's Flux library that we use.  We are still building against `org.apache.storm:flux-core:1.0.1`\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\nThis PR should be tested using the centos7 development environment.  \r\n\r\n1. Start up the centos7 dev environment.\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/development/centos7\r\n    vagrant destroy -f\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Basic Indexing and Enrichment\r\n\r\nEnsure that we can continue to parse, enrich, and index telemetry.  Verify data is flowing through the system, from parsing to indexing\r\n\r\n1. Open Ambari and navigate to the Metron service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/METRON/summary\r\n\r\n1. Open the Alerts UI.  Verify alerts show up in the main UI - click the search icon (you may need to wait a moment for them to appear)\r\n\r\n1. Go to the Alerts UI and ensure that an ever increasing number of telemetry from Bro, Snort, and YAF are visible by watching the total alert count increase over time.\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that geoip enrichment is occurring.  The telemetry should contain fields like `enrichments:geo:ip_src_addr:location_point`.\r\n\r\n1. Head back to Ambari and select the Kibana service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/KIBANA/summary\r\n\r\n1. Open the Kibana dashboard via the \"Metron UI\" option in the quick links\r\n\r\n1. Verify the dashboard is populating\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

the HDP-3.1 upgrade the existing CentOS 7 development environment will become the gold standard for developers.  This will replace the CentOS 6 development environment, which will no longer be needed.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Removed the CentOS 6 development environment.\r\n* Updated all documentation references to point to the CentOS 7 development environment.\r\n* Added a README to the CentOS 7 development environment to match what we had for CentOS 6.\r\n* Updated the Docker container on which the RPMs are built to CentOS 7.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\nThis PR should be tested using the centos7 development environment.  \r\n\r\n1. Start up the centos7 dev environment.\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/development/centos7\r\n    vagrant destroy -f\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Basic Indexing and Enrichment\r\n\r\nEnsure that we can continue to parse, enrich, and index telemetry.  Verify data is flowing through the system, from parsing to indexing\r\n\r\n1. Open Ambari and navigate to the Metron service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/METRON/summary\r\n\r\n1. Open the Alerts UI.  Verify alerts show up in the main UI - click the search icon (you may need to wait a moment for them to appear)\r\n\r\n1. Go to the Alerts UI and ensure that an ever increasing number of telemetry from Bro, Snort, and YAF are visible by watching the total alert count increase over time.\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that geoip enrichment is occurring.  The telemetry should contain fields like `enrichments:geo:ip_src_addr:location_point`.\r\n\r\n1. Head back to Ambari and select the Kibana service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/KIBANA/summary\r\n\r\n1. Open the Kibana dashboard via the \"Metron UI\" option in the quick links\r\n\r\n1. Verify the dashboard is populating\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n## Problem\r\nGo to\r\n`/alert-list`\r\nSwitch to Manual Query\r\nSwitch to Query builder, and switch back to Manual Query\r\nType something in the timestamp filter textbox.\r\nNo StaleMode warning appears.\r\n\r\n## Cause\r\nIn alert-list.component\r\n`manualQueryInputEl` needs to be undefined to indirectly fire `addManualQueryFieldChangeStream() which is responsible to change the staleDataState`.\r\nBut It's already defined when we switch from the `Query Builder` to `Manual Query` mode\r\n## Solution\r\nI have removed the condition of `manualQueryInputEl` being `undefined`. And it works fine.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

the `feature/METRON-2088-support-hdp-3.1` feature branch, the Enrichment topology is sometimes unable to load the GeoIP data from HDFS when using Kerberos authentication.  \r\n\r\n### The Problem\r\n\r\nThe Enrichment topology shows this exception.\r\n```\r\n2019-10-03 18:23:18.545 o.a.h.i.Client Curator-TreeCache-0 [WARN] Exception encountered while connecting to the server : org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException: Client cannot authenticate via:[TOKEN, KERBEROS]\r\n2019-10-03 18:23:18.552 o.a.m.e.a.m.MaxMindDbUtilities Curator-TreeCache-0 [ERROR] Unable to open new database file /apps/metron/geo/default/GeoLite2-City.tar.gz\r\njava.io.IOException: DestHost:destPort metrong-1.openstacklocal:8020 , LocalHost:localPort metrong-7/172.22.74.121:0. Failed on local exception: java.io.IOException: org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException: Client cannot authenticate via:[TOKEN, KERBEROS]\r\n```\r\n\r\n* When using Kerberos authentication with no previously cached ticket, a topology is unable to access HDFS, which primarily impacts Enrichment and Batch Indexing.\r\n* If the local credential cache on a Storm worker contains a ticket for the 'metron' user, the topology is able to access HDFS.\r\n* When using Kerberos authentication, all topologies are able to access Kafka. This only impacts HDFS.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nWe use [Storm's AutoTGT](https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/v1.2.1/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/security/auth/kerberos/AutoTGT.java) class to unpack the user credentials obtained by the Nimbus and authenticate with HDFS.  \r\n\r\nWhen attempting to authenticate with HDFS, this class uses reflection to load Hadoop's `org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation` class at runtime.  I believe Storm uses reflection so `hadoop-common` is not a required dependency for all Storm users. \r\n \r\nWhen [this class is loaded at runtime](https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/d156d25d991311eaa1f5131d3dc34787f87ce684/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/security/auth/kerberos/AutoTGT.java#L177), it fails indicating that the class is not found on the classpath.  When this occurs, the error is effectively ignored, an `INFO` message is logged (rather than error or warn), and no details from the exception are logged.  This has made it difficult to understand the cause of the problem.\r\n\r\nThe JVM is unable to load this class at runtime, despite it being on the classpath in three different places.\r\n1. The class is packaged into into the Enrichment topology Uber jar.\r\n1. The class is packaged into the Stellar common jar which is added to the classpath using `--jars`.\r\n1. The class is added to the classpath at runtime by Storm as part of storm-autocreds.\r\n\r\n### The Solution\r\n\r\nIf we use bundle a custom `AutoTGT` class in the topology uber jars, the custom `AutoTGT` implementation is able to correctly load the `hadoop-common` dependency at runtime.  This avoids the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n1. Created a custom `AutoTGT` implementation that lives within `metron-common-storm`.  This is a clone of Storm's AutoTGT except that it includes additional commentary and logging should this error occur again.\r\n\r\n1. Added `metron-common-storm` as a direct dependency of all project's that create a Storm uber jar.  In all cases except `metron-pcap-backend` this was already a transitive dependency.  We need this to be a direct dependency because without the new AutoTGT implementation, none of the topologies will start when using Kerberos authentication.\r\n\r\n1. Created an additional configuration in the Mpack for the topology's `topology.auto-credentials` property.  This can no longer default to the value of Nimbus's `nimbus.credential.renewers.classes`.  This property is only exposed to the user as an \"advanced\" setting and should rarely need changed by a user.\r\n\r\n### Validation\r\n\r\nThis is difficult (impossible?) to test in the development environment.  This should be tested on a multi-node cluster.  The bug cannot be replicated on a single node because the ticket that is cached when the topology is submitted will be reused by the Storm worker when attempting to access HDFS.  The bug only occurs when there is not already a cached ticket to use.\r\n\r\n1. Spin-up Metron on a multi-node cluster.\r\n1. Kerberize the environment.\r\n1. Start the Enrichment topology.\r\n1. Ensure that the Enrichment topology is able to load the GeoIP data from HDFS.\r\n1. Ensure that telemetry is being indexed in HDFS.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nLink to the ASF Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2292\r\n\r\nThe problem\r\n=========\r\n\r\nWhen users switch to manual query mode and type something in the search field, it doesn't count when they want to save the search. However the manual mode is visible on the screen, it always saves the recent query built by the query builder (if it's anything else but '*')\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n=====\r\n\r\n1. Go to the alerts-ui\r\n2. Switch to manual query mode\r\n3. Type something in the search field\r\n4. Click on the search button\r\n5. Click on the \"Save\" search button (floppy disc icon on the right of the magnifier)\r\n6. Open the saved searches pane (Click the button on the left of the search field)\r\n7. Choose your saved search from the list\r\n8. Please try to choose it from the recent searches list to make sure it works properly.\r\n\r\nRepeat the same with a saved search built by the query builder. The app should turn into the proper filtering mode based on the filtering mode of the saved search.\r\n\r\nIt's worth to refresh the browser between steps randomly just to make sure it's persisted properly. Since we only store saved and recent searches in the local storages, I recommend you to flush it before testing.\r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\nDuring testing, I've realised that the recent search means recent saved search. It was a bit confusing for the first time. I expected the recent search to be my latest search and not the recent saved search from the list below. Anyone else who thinks it might be confusing and misleading for the users?\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nCurrently when the User switching to manual filtering mode the show/hide toggles no longer working. This is caused by the nature of manual filtering: show/hide toggles adding implicit filter objects to the query; the reason of the manual filtering mode to give full control to the User over the query string instead of manipulating it in the background. \r\nTo resolve this \"interference\" I made the toggles disabled in manual query mode. A warning message also show up on the UI saying: \"Show/Hide toggles are not available in manual filtering mode\"\r\n\r\n![show-hide-fix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2437400/66559980-b5b89b00-eb56-11e9-8f94-654dd75fadfb.gif)\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nCurrently when the User switching to manual filtering mode the show/hide toggles no longer working. This is caused by the nature of manual filtering: show/hide toggles adding implicit filter objects to the query; the reason of the manual filtering mode to give full control to the User over the query string instead of manipulating it in the background. \r\nTo resolve this \"interference\" I made the toggles disabled in manual query mode.

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nCurrently in this feature implementation, when the user drags a standalone parser and drops it to sub-parser of a group, there is a choice with two options.\r\nOne is to merge the standalone parser into the group. Other is to create a new group out of the two involved parsers. This is only supported by the backend if we remove the originally grouped parser from its previous group (as the first step of the transaction) and then create a new one (second step of the transaction), which does not currently exist.\r\n\r\nBy eliminating the create new/merge screen, we no longer have to worry about managing this transactional operation. A user is already able to create a new group with two ungrouped parsers.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nSpin up full dev and open the Management UI in a browser. Stop a running group and drag in a parser to that group. Next, drag a parser over the newly added parser. Instead of giving the option to create a new group or merge, the parser is merged into the existing group.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

In `metron-solr-storm` we allow org.apache.solr:solr-solrj version 7.4.0 to pull in org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient version 4.5.3.  When executed in a non-kerberized environment this works just fine.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when Storm is using Kerberos authentication, it pulls in a slew of additional dependencies at runtime from `/usr/hdp/current/storm-client/contrib/storm-autocreds/`.  This includes `httpclient-4.3.6.jar` which does not contain the method mentioned above.\r\n\r\nWe need to relocate the `httpclient` dependency in the Solr uber jar to prevent Storm from trouncing on this dependency at runtime.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Spin up the centos7 development environment.\r\n\r\n1. Switch the indexer to Solr instead of Elasticsearch by [following these instructions](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-platform/metron-solr/metron-solr-common#installing).\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that telemetry is being indexed into Solr.\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that the telemetry from Solr is visible in the Alerts UI.\r\n\r\n1. Kerberize the environment.\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that telemetry is being indexed into Solr after the environment has been kerberized.\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that the telemetry from Solr is visible in the Alerts UI.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nLink to the original Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2276\r\n\r\nThe problem\r\n=========\r\n\r\nEvery time the user switches back from \"manual query mode\" (to the query builder), we clear the filter and remove everything from the search input field. Even when there were something typed in the query builder previously.\r\n\r\nThe solution\r\n=========\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we save the value of the search field no matter if it's the query builder of the manual query mode. \r\nSo instead of firing a search event every time the user switches back from manual mode, let's just simply not fire it so we can see the previous value for the query builder. And vica versa.\r\n\r\nPreviously, when the ace editor fired a \"textChanged\" event, we immediately called the search method. From now on, there's a different callback on the textChanged event which puts the application state in stale mode. \r\nThis is how it's supposed to work currently. On every change, the app should be in stale mode (there's a yellow warning message in the middle of the screen). The only way, to see the result of a new query is pressing the magnifier button (search button) on the right. \r\n\r\nPreviously that wasn't true if the user removed a query item in the query builder by pressing the tiny x icon on the right side of the query item. With this patch, this issue is going to be fixed too which means every time you remove a query item, the app is going to be in stale mode instead of performing a search immediately. \r\n\r\nAlthough it's not the scope of this PR, I've found an issue with the manual query mode. The app generates the \"raw\" representation of the query builder's result when the user switches to manual mode BUT only for the first time when there's no previous manual mode value:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/metron/blob/master/metron-interface/metron-alerts/src/app/alerts/alerts-list/query-builder.ts#L177-L179\r\n\r\nSo when the user decides to go back to the query builder, change it and then go back to manual mode, the raw value in the manual mode will be no longer the proper representation of the query builder's value.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n=====\r\n\r\n- Go the alerts-list page on the Alerts UI.\r\n- Hit the search button in order to get some result. (At the beginning, there's no result for the current value. The user has to press the search button. It should be in stale mode and show the yellow warning message)\r\n- Build a nice query with the query builder (for example by clicking on cell values in the table)\r\n- Go to manual mode and than go back to the query builder.\r\n- You should be able the see the previous value of the query builder and since nothing has changed, the application shouldn't be in stale mode. \r\n- If you change the query with the builder by adding of removing new query items, it's gonna turn into stale mode obviously without searching immediately.\r\n\r\nAlthough it solves the performance issue and prevents the users from dosing the servers, there's some limitations in the manual query mode. When you change something in the manual query mode, the application doesn't turn into stale mode however it should. And every time you change something in the manual mode and go back to the query builder, currently, the app is unable to convert the manual query to the value that is accepted by query builder which means we are unable to switch back and forth and always see the proper value in the search field in the appropriate format based on if it's the query builder or the manual mode.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

These jars are not added to the classpath when the cluster is unsecure (no kerberos).\r\n\r\nThe exception here occurs because...\r\n* We build against Guava 17.0 and Curator 2.7.1.\r\n* Curator 2.7.1 calls a Guava method MoreExecutors.sameThreadExecutor.\r\n* The method [MoreExecutors.sameThreadExecutor](https://guava.dev/releases/20.0/api/docs/com/google/common/util/concurrent/MoreExecutors.html#sameThreadExecutor--) was removed in Guava 21.0\r\n* At runtime Storm is providing Guava 28.0 (which does not include MoreExecutors.sameThreadExecutor) from `/usr/hdp/current/storm-client/contrib/storm-autocreds/guava-28.0-jre.jar` \r\n\r\n### The Fix\r\n\r\nWe need to relocate Guava 17.0 in the Solr uber jar.  This will allow Curator 2.7.1 to use Guava 17.0.  This is the same relocation that occurs for the Elasticsearch indexing topology.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n1. Spin-up the `centos7` development environment.\r\n1. Kerberize the cluster.\r\n1. Attempt to start the Indexing topologies.  The topologies should start successfully.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nLink to the original Jira ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2272\r\n\r\nThe problem\r\n=========\r\n\r\nEvery time we instantiate an ace editor instance on an angular component, it immediately forces angular to re-render the entire application very frequently (every 300-500 ms). For the first time, it's not that noticeable but after a while it can be annoying because it leads to performance issues and when you type something an ace editor input, it's gonna be really slow.\r\n\r\nThe performance slowdown is even more noticeable when you change between manual and normal query mode many times (This is how we have caught it).\r\n\r\nUnder the hood the frequent updates make Angular's zone manager very busy because it forces it to do a lot of dirty checking. To be fair it really is an issue only in development mode when dirty checking require more resource consumption.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n=====\r\n\r\nCheckout the latest master branch and open the Alerts UI. Go to the `alerts-list` page and start typing something in the search input field at the top of the page just to get the feeling how it should behave normally. Then change between \"Manual query\" and \"Query builder\" mode a few times (e.g. 15-20 times). Make sure you're in \"Query builder\" mode and type something again in the search input field. See how slow and laggy it is?\r\n\r\nNow checkout `METRON-2272` and repeat the previous steps. Like a breath of a fresh air, isn't it?\r\n\r\nFurther\r\n=====\r\n\r\nAs a bonus I also destroy the ace instances when angular is about to detach the component from the DOM. My assumption is that we could achieve even bigger performance boost if we convert our ace editor directive to a component and change the changeDetection strategy to onPush. I didn't want to do that in this PR in order to make the review process easier.  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

are increasingly hitting the 50 minute time limit on our integration test job in Travis.  This \r\n causes the entire Travis build to fail.  My goal here is to make minor modifications to avoid these failures until we can come back for a more comprehensive review of our integration tests to address the issue of total run time.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nThe way in which we organize the Travis build currently causes each job to build *all* of Metron, *every* time.  Although we attempt to cache the local Maven repository to avoid repetitively building Metron, in practice all of the jobs in a build start roughly in parallel and so this cache is never used.  The result is that every job builds all of Metron. \r\n\r\nAs evidence review how long it takes for the license verification job to complete.  While this should take a few seconds/minutes, this always takes 15+ minutes because the job does a full build of Metron.  It is never able to re-use what was built and cached by any other job.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nBy reorganizing the build, so that each job only builds the modules that it needs (and avoid a one-size-fits-all \"install\" step) we save enough time to avoid breaching the 50 minute time limit on any individual job.  In addition, I added names to each job to improve clarity in the Travis UI and split out the the UI tests so that the Alerts and Management tests run separately.\r\n\r\nThese are the advantages that I see with this change.\r\n\r\n1. This will prevent us from unnecessarily breaching the 50 minute time limit for the integration test job with minimal effort or risk as compared to re-architecting the integration tests. \r\n\r\n1. We get more immediate feedback. If you messed up the licenses, you're going to know in a minute, rather than after 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n1. We have a much more accurate picture of how long each step is taking.  Previously the site-book appeared to take 16-18 minutes, but it is now very clear that it takes 1-2 minutes.\r\n\r\n1. The total aggregate run time was previously 2.25-2.5 hours, but is now about 1.25-1.5 hours.  This is less load on Travis and we like Travis, so let's help him out.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1292\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-01 at 5 45 14 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/66003180-6053fe00-e473-11e9-898e-39db49fcf5f6.png\">\r\n\r\nSee the following examples.\r\n* https://travis-ci.org/nickwallen/metron/builds/592235729 \r\n* https://travis-ci.org/apache/metron/builds/592263213\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR includes code and documentation changes for enabling Kerberos in HDP 3.1.   The primary changes needed were minor Maven changes and making the Metron JAAS setting available to Kafka through `KAFKA_OPTS`. \r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n\r\n- Changes to KDC setup documentation for Centos7\r\n- Changes to Kerberos setup documentation for HDP 3.1\r\n- Minor Mpack change for looking up a host name\r\n- Addition of a `CLIENT_JAAS_ARG` property to `/etc/default/metron`.  This is needed separately from `METRON_JVMFLAGS `\r\n-  Updated the Kafka `security.protocol` setting to `SASL_PLAINTEXT`\r\n- Maven changes to handle classpath errors that result from the extra jars added by Storm when Kerberos is enabled.  The extra jars are located in `/usr/hdp/current/storm-supervisor/external/storm-autocreds/*`.\r\n- Replaced a call to `org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils` with a standard Java implementation.  This dependency was being pulled in transitively.\r\n- Fixed a bug in `metron-data-management` that resulted from `com.google.thirdparty` not being shaded.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nI attempted to test the various components (Storm, Kafka, HBase, Hadoop, etc) to verify they still work after Kerberos is enabled.  The instructions in `Kerberos-manual-setup.md` should now be correct.  Also there should not be any additional steps needed to enabled the sensor stubs other than a simple restart.  I tested the following after spinning up full dev:\r\n\r\n- Verified data is flowing through to ES and HDFS and the Alerts UI works.\r\n- Verified the various Profiler README examples work\r\n- Verified the `flatfile_loader.sh` script works as expected\r\n- Verified Stellar works with Kafka (added docs for this)\r\n\r\nI believe this should cover almost all of the components.  There were not any specific Solr changes required (was done in the [Solr upgrade PR](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2225)) but we might want to test this too.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

`metron-hbase-client` which is used by `metron-rest` has some special handling for pulling in a shaded HBase client library.  This pulls in a different version (1.1.2) than the global HBase version to work around a known HBase bug.  After the upgrade to 2.0.2, this work around is no longer needed and can be removed.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\nThis PR should be tested using the centos7 development environment.  \r\n\r\n1. Start up the centos7 dev environment.\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/development/centos7\r\n    vagrant destroy -f\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Basics\r\n\r\nEnsure that we can continue to parse, enrich, and index telemetry.  Verify data is flowing through the system, from parsing to indexing\r\n\r\n1. Open Ambari and navigate to the Metron service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/METRON/summary\r\n\r\n1. Open the Alerts UI.  Verify alerts show up in the main UI - click the search icon (you may need to wait a moment for them to appear)\r\n\r\n1. Go to the Alerts UI and ensure that an ever increasing number of telemetry from Bro, Snort, and YAF are visible by watching the total alert count increase over time.\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that geoip enrichment is occurring.  The telemetry should contain fields like `enrichments:geo:ip_src_addr:location_point`.\r\n\r\n1. Head back to Ambari and select the Kibana service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/KIBANA/summary\r\n\r\n1. Open the Kibana dashboard via the \"Metron UI\" option in the quick links\r\n\r\n1. Verify the dashboard is populating\r\n\r\n###  Streaming Enrichments\r\n\r\n  1. Create a Streaming Enrichment [by following these instructions](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/2016/06/16/Metron+Tutorial+-+Fundamentals+Part+6%3A+Streaming+Enrichment).\r\n\r\n  1. Launch the Stellar REPL.\r\n      ```\r\n      source /etc/default/metron\r\n      cd $METRON_HOME\r\n      $METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Define the streaming enrichment and save it as a new source of telemetry.\r\n\r\n      ```\r\n      [Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT(conf)\r\n      {\r\n        \"parserClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.parsers.csv.CSVParser\",\r\n        \"writerClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.writer.hbase.SimpleHbaseEnrichmentWriter\",\r\n        \"sensorTopic\": \"user\",\r\n        \"parserConfig\": {\r\n          \"shew.table\": \"enrichment\",\r\n          \"shew.cf\": \"t\",\r\n          \"shew.keyColumns\": \"ip\",\r\n          \"shew.enrichmentType\": \"user\",\r\n          \"columns\": {\r\n            \"user\": 0,\r\n            \"ip\": 1\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      [Stellar]>>>\r\n      [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"PARSER\", conf, \"user\")\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Go to the Management UI and start the new parser called 'user'.\r\n\r\n  1. Create some test telemetry.\r\n      ```\r\n      [Stellar]>>> msgs := [\"user1,192.168.1.1\", \"user2,192.168.1.2\", \"user3,192.168.1.3\"]\r\n      [user1,192.168.1.1, user2,192.168.1.2, user3,192.168.1.3]\r\n      [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_PUT(\"user\", msgs)\r\n      3\r\n      [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_PUT(\"user\", msgs)\r\n      3\r\n      [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_PUT(\"user\", msgs)\r\n      3\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Ensure that the enrichments are persisted in HBase.\r\n      ```\r\n      [Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_GET('user', '192.168.1.1', 'enrichment', 't')\r\n      {original_string=user1,192.168.1.1, guid=a6caf3c1-2506-4eb7-b33e-7c05b77cd72c, user=user1, timestamp=1551813589399, source.type=user}\r\n\r\n      [Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_GET('user', '192.168.1.2', 'enrichment', 't')\r\n      {original_string=user2,192.168.1.2, guid=49e4b8fa-c797-44f0-b041-cfb47983d54a, user=user2, timestamp=1551813589399, source.type=user}\r\n\r\n      [Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_GET('user', '192.168.1.3', 'enrichment', 't')\r\n      {original_string=user3,192.168.1.3, guid=324149fd-6c4c-42a3-b579-e218c032ea7f, user=user3, timestamp=1551813589402, source.type=user}\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n### Enrichment Coprocessor\r\n\r\n  1. Confirm that the 'user' enrichment added in the previous section was 'found' by the coprocessor.\r\n        * Go to Swagger. \r\n        * Click the `sensor-enrichment-config-controller` option.\r\n        * Click the `GET /api/v1/sensor/enrichment/config/list/available/enrichments` option.\r\n\r\n  1. Click the \"Try it out!\" button. You should see a array returned with the value of each enrichment type that you have loaded.\r\n    ```\r\n    [\r\n      \"user\"\r\n    ]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

puppeteer module is used for GUI testing, and allows Chrome to be driven headless for GUI testing purposes. Every time that puppeteer is installed, (which is every build), it downloads Chrome (80-120 MB download, 250+ MB on disk). Puppeteer cannot be configured to cache the download for future use.\r\n\r\nAngular/NodeJS has a concept a dev dependency, which is only installed for testing. Dev-dependencies are not installed during a full dev build/deployment. Moving puppeteer to be a dev-dependency means that Chrome is only downloaded when automated testing is about to happen.\r\n\r\nThis patch works against Master before Metron-2243 was merged on 3rd September. Past that date, an issue that prevents automated GUI tests from completely correctly was inadvertently introduced, and thus automated GUI testing cannot confirm correct operation.\r\n\r\nOnce this issue has been identified this PR will be updated to Merge with the current Master branch.\r\n\r\nManual testing.\r\n\r\nrun. mvn clean install -pl :metron-alerts -DskipTests\r\n\r\nVerify the following lines are not present\r\n\r\n> puppeteer@1.19.0 install /Users/dale/work/metron-testing/metron-interface/metron-alerts/node_modules/puppeteer\r\n> node install.js\r\n[ERROR] \r\nChromium downloaded to /Users/dale/work/metron-testing/metron-interface/metron-alerts/node_modules/puppeteer/.local-chromium/mac-674921\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR is based on [METRON-2261](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1515) and includes those changes.  It must be merged before this.\r\n\r\nThis PR upgrades Curator to version 4.2.0 and fixes a couple bugs in `MaasIntegrationTest` that resulted from the upgrade.  There was an extra service unregister in the `ContainerRequestListener` class (should only be unregistered once) and another more complicated bug (described in the next section).\r\n\r\n### Bug Fix\r\nAfter upgrading to Curator version 4.2.0, both tests in `MaasIntegrationTest` fail with this error:\r\n```\r\ntestMaaSWithoutDomain(org.apache.metron.maas.service.MaasIntegrationTest)  Time elapsed: 214.791 sec  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError\r\n\tat org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:86)\r\n\tat org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:41)\r\n\tat org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:52)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.maas.service.MaasIntegrationTest.testDSShell(MaasIntegrationTest.java:269)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.maas.service.MaasIntegrationTest.testMaaSWithoutDomain(MaasIntegrationTest.java:113)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\r\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498)\r\n\tat org.junit.runners.model.FrameworkMethod$1.runReflectiveCall(FrameworkMethod.java:50)\r\n\tat org.junit.internal.runners.model.ReflectiveCallable.run(ReflectiveCallable.java:12)\r\n\tat org.junit.runners.model.FrameworkMethod.invokeExplosively(FrameworkMethod.java:47)\r\n\tat org.junit.internal.runners.statements.InvokeMethod.evaluate(InvokeMethod.java:17)\r\n\tat org.junit.internal.runners.statements.FailOnTimeout$CallableStatement.call(FailOnTimeout.java:298)\r\n\tat org.junit.internal.runners.statements.FailOnTimeout$CallableStatement.call(FailOnTimeout.java:292)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\r\n``` \r\nThe service is not properly unregistered, the test [waits for the service to be removed from the list of endpoints](https://github.com/apache/metron/blob/master/metron-analytics/metron-maas-service/src/test/java/org/apache/metron/maas/service/MaasIntegrationTest.java#L261) and then timeouts and fails.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is a change in how the `org.apache.curator.x.discovery.details. ServiceDiscoveryImpl` class unregisters a service after the upgrade.  The list of services is maintained in 2 places:  Zookeeper and an [internal Map](https://github.com/apache/curator/blob/apache-curator-4.2.0/curator-x-discovery/src/main/java/org/apache/curator/x/discovery/details/ServiceDiscoveryImpl.java#L64) in `ServiceDiscoveryImpl`.  There are several read functions in `ServiceDiscoveryImpl` but then don't refresh the internal Map.  The internal Map is only updated when `registerService` and `unregisterService` are called. \r\n\r\nBefore the upgrade, a service is [removed from Zookeeper](https://github.com/apache/curator/blob/apache-curator-2.7.0/curator-x-discovery/src/main/java/org/apache/curator/x/discovery/details/ServiceDiscoveryImpl.java#L218) then [removed from the internal Map](https://github.com/apache/curator/blob/apache-curator-2.7.0/curator-x-discovery/src/main/java/org/apache/curator/x/discovery/details/ServiceDiscoveryImpl.java#L224).\r\n\r\nAfter the upgrade, the order is reversed.  The service is [removed from the internal Map](https://github.com/apache/curator/blob/apache-curator-4.2.0/curator-x-discovery/src/main/java/org/apache/curator/x/discovery/details/ServiceDiscoveryImpl.java#L255) then [removed from Zookeeper](https://github.com/apache/curator/blob/apache-curator-4.2.0/curator-x-discovery/src/main/java/org/apache/curator/x/discovery/details/ServiceDiscoveryImpl.java#L524).  However there is a check that [ensures the service existed in the internal Map](https://github.com/apache/curator/blob/apache-curator-4.2.0/curator-x-discovery/src/main/java/org/apache/curator/x/discovery/details/ServiceDiscoveryImpl.java#L511) before removing it for Zookeeper.  Services are registered in `org.apache.metron.maas.service.runner.Runner` and unregistered in `org.apache.metron.maas.service.callback.ContainerRequestListener`.  The latter runs in a different process so registered services are not in the internal Map.  This was not a problem before the upgrade because Zookeeper was updated regardless of the internal Map state.\r\n\r\nThe fix proposed in this PR is to register a service immediately before unregistering it in `org.apache.metron.maas.discovery.ServiceDiscoverer`.  This populates the internal Map in `ServiceDiscoveryImpl` with the service so that the subsequent unregister call functions correctly.  A side effect of this would be writing duplicate data to Zookeeper.  The only other solution I can think of would be to rearchitect how and where services are registered/unregistered.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThe `MaasIntegrationTest` (and all tests) should pass.  Upgrading Curator without the fixes in this PR should cause the error above.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

part of the HDP 3.1 upgrade, we need to upgrade to Curator 4.x.  There was a [discuss thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/265a76f6071229af662135b92df6db652d8ee2b17dbec8af7e8bf1ba@%3Cdev.metron.apache.org%3E)  covering the need for this.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Curator is being pulled in as a transitive of Hadoop, HBase and Storm.  At the current version levels of these dependencies this does not cause a problem.  But when upgrading Hadoop, different conflicting versions of Curator will get pulled in.  We need to ensure that only a single version of Curator is pulled in after upgrading Hadoop.  \r\n\r\nThis change is preparing us for follow-on PRs including...\r\n1. [Upgrade to Curator 4.x](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2262) #1516 \r\n2. [Upgrade to Hadoop 3.1.1](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2232).\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* This change will maintain the current versions in use including Curator 2.7.1 and Zookeeper 3.4.6 (see note 1).\r\n\r\n* Defines Zookeeper as a direct dependency instead of relying on it being pulled in as a transitive of Curator (see note 2).\r\n\r\n* Defines Curator as a direct dependency instead of relying on it being pulled in as a transitive.\r\n\r\n* Introduces a separate `${global_curator_test_version}` to allow the Curator test dependencies to differ from the main Curator version `${global_curator_version}`.  This will be needed when upgrading to Curator 4.x (see note 3).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\n\r\n1.  In upgrading to Curator 4.x, there is a breaking change that causes the MaasIntegrationTest to fail.  The fix for that plus the actual upgrade to Curator 4.x will be performed under a separate Jira to aid the review process.\r\n\r\n2. When upgrading to Curator 4.x, we will need to continue to run against Zookeeper 3.4.6.   By default Curator 4.x will pull in Zookeeper 3.5.x.\r\n\r\n3. To run with Curator 4.x and Zookeeper 3.4.6, we need to use the 2.12.0 version of curator-test based on [this information provided by the Curator community](http://curator.apache.org/zk-compatibility.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\nThis PR should be tested using the centos7 development environment.  \r\n\r\n1. Start up the centos7 dev environment.\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/development/centos7\r\n    vagrant destroy -f\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Basics\r\n\r\nEnsure that we can continue to parse, enrich, and index telemetry.  Verify data is flowing through the system, from parsing to indexing\r\n\r\n1. Open Ambari and navigate to the Metron service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/METRON/summary\r\n\r\n1. Open the Alerts UI.  Verify alerts show up in the main UI - click the search icon (you may need to wait a moment for them to appear)\r\n\r\n1. Go to the Alerts UI and ensure that an ever increasing number of telemetry from Bro, Snort, and YAF are visible by watching the total alert count increase over time.\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that geoip enrichment is occurring.  The telemetry should contain fields like `enrichments:geo:ip_src_addr:location_point`.\r\n\r\n1. Head back to Ambari and select the Kibana service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/KIBANA/summary\r\n\r\n1. Open the Kibana dashboard via the \"Metron UI\" option in the quick links\r\n\r\n1. Verify the dashboard is populating\r\n\r\n###  Streaming Enrichments\r\n\r\n  1. Create a Streaming Enrichment [by following these instructions](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/2016/06/16/Metron+Tutorial+-+Fundamentals+Part+6%3A+Streaming+Enrichment).\r\n\r\n  1. Launch the Stellar REPL.\r\n      ```\r\n      source /etc/default/metron\r\n      cd $METRON_HOME\r\n      $METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Define the streaming enrichment and save it as a new source of telemetry.\r\n\r\n      ```\r\n      [Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT(conf)\r\n      {\r\n        \"parserClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.parsers.csv.CSVParser\",\r\n        \"writerClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.writer.hbase.SimpleHbaseEnrichmentWriter\",\r\n        \"sensorTopic\": \"user\",\r\n        \"parserConfig\": {\r\n          \"shew.table\": \"enrichment\",\r\n          \"shew.cf\": \"t\",\r\n          \"shew.keyColumns\": \"ip\",\r\n          \"shew.enrichmentType\": \"user\",\r\n          \"columns\": {\r\n            \"user\": 0,\r\n            \"ip\": 1\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      [Stellar]>>>\r\n      [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"PARSER\", conf, \"user\")\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Go to the Management UI and start the new parser called 'user'.\r\n\r\n  1. Create some test telemetry.\r\n      ```\r\n      [Stellar]>>> msgs := [\"user1,192.168.1.1\", \"user2,192.168.1.2\", \"user3,192.168.1.3\"]\r\n      [user1,192.168.1.1, user2,192.168.1.2, user3,192.168.1.3]\r\n      [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_PUT(\"user\", msgs)\r\n      3\r\n      [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_PUT(\"user\", msgs)\r\n      3\r\n      [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_PUT(\"user\", msgs)\r\n      3\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Ensure that the enrichments are persisted in HBase.\r\n      ```\r\n      [Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_GET('user', '192.168.1.1', 'enrichment', 't')\r\n      {original_string=user1,192.168.1.1, guid=a6caf3c1-2506-4eb7-b33e-7c05b77cd72c, user=user1, timestamp=1551813589399, source.type=user}\r\n\r\n      [Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_GET('user', '192.168.1.2', 'enrichment', 't')\r\n      {original_string=user2,192.168.1.2, guid=49e4b8fa-c797-44f0-b041-cfb47983d54a, user=user2, timestamp=1551813589399, source.type=user}\r\n\r\n      [Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_GET('user', '192.168.1.3', 'enrichment', 't')\r\n      {original_string=user3,192.168.1.3, guid=324149fd-6c4c-42a3-b579-e218c032ea7f, user=user3, timestamp=1551813589402, source.type=user}\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n### Enrichment Coprocessor\r\n\r\n  1. Confirm that the 'user' enrichment added in the previous section was 'found' by the coprocessor.\r\n        * Go to Swagger. \r\n        * Click the `sensor-enrichment-config-controller` option.\r\n        * Click the `GET /api/v1/sensor/enrichment/config/list/available/enrichments` option.\r\n\r\n  1. Click the \"Try it out!\" button. You should see a array returned with the value of each enrichment type that you have loaded.\r\n    ```\r\n    [\r\n      \"user\"\r\n    ]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Enrichment Stellar Functions in Storm\r\n\r\n  1. Follow [instructions similar to these](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/2016/04/28/Metron+Tutorial+-+Fundamentals+Part+2%3A+Creating+a+New+Enrichment) to load\r\n  the user data.\r\n\r\n  1. Create a simple file called `user.csv`.\r\n    ```\r\n    jdoe,192.168.138.2\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n  1. Create a file called `user-extractor.json`.\r\n      ```\r\n      {\r\n        \"config\": {\r\n          \"columns\": {\r\n            \"user\": 0,\r\n            \"ip\": 1\r\n          },\r\n          \"indicator_column\": \"ip\",\r\n          \"separator\": \",\",\r\n          \"type\": \"user\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"extractor\": \"CSV\"\r\n      }\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Import the data.\r\n      ```\r\n      source /etc/default/metron\r\n      $METRON_HOME/bin/flatfile_loader.sh -i ./user.csv -t enrichment -c t -e ./user-extractor.json\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Validate that the enrichment loaded successfully.\r\n      ```\r\n      [root@node1 0.7.2]# source /etc/default/metron\r\n      [root@node1 0.7.2]# $METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n      \r\n      [Stellar]>>> ip_dst_addr := \"192.168.138.2\"\r\n      192.168.138.2\r\n      \r\n      [Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_GET('user', ip_dst_addr, 'enrichment', 't')\r\n      {ip=192.168.138.2, user=jdoe}\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Use the User data to enrich the telemetry.  Run the following commands in the REPL.\r\n      ```\r\n      [Stellar]>>> bro := SHELL_EDIT()\r\n      {\r\n       \"enrichment\" : {\r\n         \"fieldMap\": {\r\n           \"stellar\" : {\r\n             \"config\" : {\r\n               \"users\" : \"ENRICHMENT_GET('user', ip_dst_addr, 'enrichment', 't')\"\r\n             }\r\n           }\r\n         }\r\n       },\r\n       \"threatIntel\": {\r\n         \"fieldMap\": {},\r\n         \"fieldToTypeMap\": {}\r\n       }\r\n      }\r\n      [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"ENRICHMENT\", bro, \"bro\")\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Wait for the new configuration to be picked up by the running topology.\r\n\r\n  1. Review the Bro telemetry indexed into Elasticsearch.  Look for records where the `ip_dst_addr` is `192.168.138.2`. Ensure that some of the messages have the following fields created from the enrichment.\r\n      * `users:user`\r\n      * `users:ip`\r\n      ```\r\n      {\r\n        \"_index\": \"bro_index_2019.08.13.20\",\r\n        \"_type\": \"bro_doc\",\r\n        \"_id\": \"AWyMxSJFg1bv3MpSt284\",\r\n        ...\r\n        \"_source\": {          \r\n          \"ip_dst_addr\": \"192.168.138.2\",\r\n          \"ip_src_addr\": \"192.168.138.158\",\r\n          \"timestamp\": 1565729823979,\r\n          \"source:type\": \"bro\",\r\n          \"guid\": \"6778beb4-569d-478f-b1c9-8faaf475ac2f\"\r\n          ...\r\n          \"users:user\": \"jdoe\",\r\n          \"users:ip\": \"192.168.138.2\",\r\n          ...\r\n        },\r\n        ...\r\n      }\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n### Legacy HBase Adapter\r\n\r\nWe are going to perform the same enrichment, but instead using the legacy HBase Adapter.\r\n\r\n  1. Use the User data to enrich the telemetry.  Run the following commands in the REPL.\r\n      ```\r\n      [Stellar]>>> yaf := SHELL_EDIT()\r\n      {\r\n        \"enrichment\" : {\r\n          \"fieldMap\" : {\r\n            \"hbaseEnrichment\" : [ \"ip_dst_addr\" ]\r\n          },\r\n          \"fieldToTypeMap\" : {\r\n             \"ip_dst_addr\" : [ \"user\" ]\r\n          },\r\n          \"config\" : {\r\n            \"typeToColumnFamily\" : {\r\n              \"user\" : \"t\"\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"threatIntel\" : { },\r\n        \"configuration\" : { }\r\n      }\r\n      [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"ENRICHMENT\", yaf, \"yaf\")\r\n      ```\r\n    \r\n  1. Wait for the new configuration to be picked up by the running topology.\r\n\r\n  1. Review the YAF telemetry indexed into Elasticsearch.  Look for records where the `ip_dst_addr` is `192.168.138.2`. Ensure that some of the messages have the following fields created from the enrichment.\r\n      * `enrichments:hbaseEnrichment:ip_dst_addr:user:ip`\r\n      * `enrichments:hbaseEnrichment:ip_dst_addr:user:user`\r\n      ```\r\n      {\r\n        \"_index\": \"yaf_index_2019.08.15.03\",\r\n        \"_type\": \"yaf_doc\",\r\n        \"_id\": \"AWyTZAwEIFY9jxc2THLF\",\r\n        \"_version\": 1,\r\n        \"_score\": null,\r\n        \"_source\": {\r\n          \"source:type\": \"yaf\",\r\n          \"ip_dst_addr\": \"192.168.138.2\",\r\n          \"ip_src_addr\": \"192.168.138.158\",\r\n          \"guid\": \"6c73c09d-f099-4646-b653-762adce121fe\",\r\n          ...\r\n          \"enrichments:hbaseEnrichment:ip_dst_addr:user:ip\": \"192.168.138.2\",\r\n          \"enrichments:hbaseEnrichment:ip_dst_addr:user:user\": \"jdoe\",\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      ```   \r\n### Profiler\r\n\r\n#### Profiler in the REPL\r\n\r\n1. Test a profile in the REPL according to [these instructions](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-analytics/metron-profiler-repl#getting-started).\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> values := PROFILER_FLUSH(profiler)\r\n    [{period={duration=900000, period=1723089, start=1550780100000, end=1550781000000}, profile=hello-world, groups=[], value=4, entity=192.168.138.158}]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n#### Streaming Profiler\r\n \r\n1. Deploy that profile to the Streaming Profiler in Storm.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"PROFILER\", conf)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Wait for the Streaming Profiler in Storm to flush and retrieve the measurement from HBase.  \r\n\r\n    For the impatient, you can reset the period duration to 1 minute. Alternatively, you can allow the Profiler topology to work for a minute or two and then kill the `profiler` topology which will force it to flush a profile measurement to HBase.\r\n\r\n    Retrieve the measurement from HBase.  Prior to this PR, it was not possible to query HBase from the REPL.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"hello-world\",\"192.168.138.158\",PROFILE_FIXED(30,\"DAYS\"))\r\n    [2979]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nAs a part of this pull request I introduce the concepts of blocking and non blocking search queries for Alerts UI. With this feature UI can give feedback to our users about the ongoing query process. Also, can prevent sending multiple requests in a row, before getting response or failure.\r\n\r\nAs a prerequisite of this I had to separate blocking and non-blocking query operations.\r\nBlocking query operations (triggered by user)\r\n- querying/searching by search button\r\n- page size change\r\n- sorting\r\n- grouping\r\n- show/hide dismissed or resolved items\r\nNon-blocking query operation is basically\r\n- automatic polling (triggered by timer)\r\n\r\n## Congestion handling\r\n### Search triggered by the User\r\nCongestion is no longer possible with queries triggered by the user because of the modal loading indicator. This indicator prevents any interaction till the request resolves with a result or a failure.\r\n### Automatic polling\r\nIn case the response time is longer than the polling interval user, able to overload the back-end. Simply by automatically sending a new request before the previous one get processed on the next interval. (If the response time is 30 sec and the interval is 10, this means 3 parallel request. Each one of them increasing the processing time further.)\r\nTo protect our services from auto polling overload UI skipping every polling cycle till a pending request exists. In this scenario the UI shows a warning to the User about the congestion and ask to increase the polling interval or optimize the query filter.\r\n\r\n## Small improvements on auto polling\r\n- auto polling sends an initial request on start\r\n- auto polling state persisted\r\n    - on/of state\r\n    - interval restored\r\n\r\n## Other related changes\r\n- surrounding code had to be deeply refactored, to decouple search, auto poll and row config\r\n- auto polling logic moved to a single service (previously it was shared across alerts-list.component, search.service and query-builder.service)\r\n- conflicts with manual filtering feature\r\n    - manual query/filter string and the belonging logic had to be moved from alerts-list.component to query-builder\r\n    - I restored the \"single source of query string\", no matter it is made by the builder logic or manually by the user\r\n    - with this auto polling able to pick up the latest query in every interval from one single source\r\n\r\n## Known issues currently in the master\r\nThere is a few known issue in the current code base, what might interfere with this changeset while your are testing. Please keep in mind, these are already reproducible on the master branch and not introduced by this. To keep this PR in a reasonable size, I haven't try to fix them as a part of current changeset. However, as a positive impact of all of the refactoring work we did we'll be able to fix them more easily on the top of this PR.\r\n\r\n[[UI] Switching back from manual filtering mode eliminates time range filter from query](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2258)\r\n[[UI] Hide Resolved and Hide Dismissed toggles not works when filtering is in manual mode](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2259)\r\n[[UI] Performance: Switching manual filtering on and off multiple times leads slow typing](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2260)\r\n\r\nI'm planning to target these in followup PRs.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n### Scenario 1 (manual querying)\r\n- Search queries initiated by the following interactions\r\n    - querying/searching by search button\r\n    - page size change\r\n    - sorting\r\n    - grouping\r\n    - show/hide dismissed or resolved items\r\n- should be indicated by a modal loader\r\n- The User has to be prevented from any further interaction on the UI while the operation is in progress.\r\n#### Scenario 1.1 (error handling)\r\n- An error dialogue should show up on the UI in case of internal server error.\r\n\r\n### Scenario 2 (auto polling)\r\n- User should be able to start/stop auto polling by the play/pause icon below the searh button\r\n#### Scenario 2.1 (error handling)\r\n- An error dialogue should show up on the UI in case of internal server error.\r\n#### Scenario 2.2 (congestion handling)\r\n- When the user set up a short polling interval\r\n- And the response time is slower then polling interval\r\n- A non modal warning should show up for the user\r\n- All further polling request should be skipped to avoid overload until a response, timeout or error occur\r\n\r\n### Scenario 3 (polling suppression)\r\n- When auto polling is turned on\r\n- The following operations should temporarily suppress polling\r\n    - selecting alerts by checkbox\r\n    - showing details pane\r\n    - showing save search pane\r\n    - showing load search pane\r\n- After close or deselect the polling should continue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR resolves a regression introduced in the dependency upgrades in [METRON-2243](https://github.com/apache/metron/commit/edc449ffa6be51749f6a3b100bf6a0a33755e50c) (Thanks for catching this, @tigerquoll!)\r\n\r\nI haven't quite identified the 'why' to this bug, but it looks like Cypress' update to use Electron 61 in release 3.3.0 is causing some issues with Cypress' click functionality. See the below gif, which is a recording of tests being run in Electron 61. You can see in the test side panel that the PCAP link was successfully clicked, but the route quickly changes from `/pcap` back to `/alerts-list`. The error complains about an xhr request that was never detected, probably because we weren't on the pcap page long enough to fire the request. The failures are random and differ from test run to test run, but in every video I captured the cause shows to stem from the route never changing after clicking the PCAP link.\r\n\r\n![cypress-failure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/64974548-47f9b600-d8ad-11e9-8ced-505d639dd8cd.gif)\r\n\r\nI reverted Cypress to release 3.2.0, which unfortunately introduces a high-vulnerability nested dependency. [I created an issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5152) in the Cypress repository. Hopefully we can get this resolved quickly.\r\n\r\n### New Security Vulnerability\r\nWith this dependency downgrade comes a nested dependency (lodash) that contains [a high-severity security vulnerability](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1065). However, as the maintainers of Cypress have pointed out, [it isn't susceptible to this security issue since it's locally run software](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4730#issuecomment-512765173).\r\n\r\nObviously, this is not ideal and will probably be flagged with a security audit. However, this is the only way to resolve this issue for now. While it is possible that I could edit the package-lock.json file, doing so is not ideal because it can be easily overridden with a user running `npm i` (resolving merge conflicts comes to mind here).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nNOTE: We've only detected this on macOS, so you'll need that to test.\r\n\r\nFrom the root of the project, run `mvn install -pl :metron-alerts`. If testing on master, it will fail with random Cypress failures. If running on this branch, everything should pass as it should.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis change is added as work around for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBARI-25375\r\nThis only affects the recommendations in Ambari - users can still modify the hosts for the components as they see fit.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nIn order reproduce the error being fixed in this bug, pull the latest feature branch code without this fix and follow the following test plan that also verifies the fix.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n\r\nIn order reproduce the error being fixed in this bug, pull the latest feature branch code without this fix and follow the following test plan that also verifies the fix.\r\n\r\n#### Testing in fulldev\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev with Centos 7\r\n    ```\r\n    cd ./metron-deployment/development/centos7/\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n#### Uninstall Metron service\r\n\r\n1. Once the install completes, open Ambari http://node1:8080 and stop all Metron services under the Metron service option. We need to do this in order to uninstall.\r\n2. Click Actions and choose delete service. Confirm.\r\n3. The Metron Ambari service should be deleted\r\n\r\n#### Re-install Metron service\r\n\r\n1. Click the ellipses next to \"Services\" in Ambari and choose \"Add Service\"\r\n2. Select Metron in the list of services to install. Accept the additional components by clicking \"Ok\" for each.\r\n3. The \"Assign Masters\" page is where the bug previously existed. The \"Next\" option was greyed out due to the hostname errors. At this point, you can accept the defaults (node1 for full dev) and click \"Next.\"\r\n4. You can finish the installation if you like, but at this point the bug fix has been validated.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nNodeJS Module puppeteer moved to be a dev dependency.\r\nThe puppeteer module is used for GUI testing, and allows Chrome to be driven headless for GUI testing purposes.  Every time that puppeteer is installed, (which is every build), it downloads Chrome (80-120 MB download, 250+ MB on disk).  Puppeteer cannot be configured to cache the download for future use.\r\n\r\nAngular/NodeJS has a concept a dev dependency, which is only installed for testing.  Dev-dependencies are not installed during a full dev build/deployment.  Moving puppeteer to be a dev-dependency means that Chrome is only downloaded when automated testing is about to happen.\r\n\r\nThis patch works against Master before Metron-2243 was merged on 3rd September.  Past that date, an issue that prevents automated GUI tests from completely correctly was inadvertently introduced, and thus automated GUI testing cannot confirm correct operation.\r\n\r\nOnce this issue has been identified this PR will be updated to Merge with the current Master branch.\r\n\r\n## Manual testing.\r\nrun. `mvn clean install -pl :metron-alerts -DskipTests`\r\n\r\nVerify the following lines are not present\r\n\r\n```\r\n> puppeteer@1.19.0 install /Users/dale/work/metron-testing/metron-interface/metron-alerts/node_modules/puppeteer\r\n> node install.js\r\n[ERROR] \r\nChromium downloaded to /Users/dale/work/metron-testing/metron-interface/metron-alerts/node_modules/puppeteer/.local-chromium/mac-674921\r\n```\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

`RestFunctionsIntegrationTest.restGetShouldTimeoutWithSuppliedTimeout` test will intermittently fail.\r\n\r\nWe use an in-memory, mock server to respond to HTTP requests made during these tests. The way that we currently test a timeout is to set the timeout extremely low (1 millisecond) and assume that the in-memory, mock server will not be able to respond fast enough.  In most cases this works, but in some cases this does not and causes CI failures.\r\n\r\nThis most likely doesn't work at times because the functionality that we use to timeout just isn't granular enough to enforce a 1 millisecond timeout.  So its much more likely enforcing a timeout on the order of tens or hundreds of milliseconds.  And if the enforcement mechanism is slower than mock server, the test case will fail.\r\n\r\nRather than doing that, there is a method that allows us to introduce a fixed delay before the mock server responds.  This should provide us with reliable pass/fail signal from these tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds a new angular build profile for npm projects called \"devbuild\",  which becomes the then can be used as an angular build profile for npm projects (Metron-alerts

For Dev deployment this tradeoff between runtime and compile time is likely to be worthwhile in a large number of cases.\r\n\r\nThis build profile is controlled via a maven definition:\r\n`mvn install -Dangular.build.profile=devbuild` (the new option)\r\nor\r\n`mvn install -Dangular.build.profile=Production`.

integration test is failing intermittently on the `feature/METRON-2088-support-hdp-3.1` feature branch.  It is now failing more often than not, which will at least help validation of the fix.\r\n```\r\nPcapTopologyIntegrationTest.setupAll:150->setupTopology:269 expected:<20> but was:<1>\r\n```\r\n\r\nDuring setup it expects to load up 20 messages used during the remainder of the tests. In less performant environments (like Travis) the messages are often not yet sent by the client and ready for the tests when validation occurs.  \r\n\r\nThis is because the Kafka client maintains an internal buffer of messages that are sent asynchronously.  Before we allow the tests to proceed we need to ensure that the client buffer has been flushed and all messages have been sent.\r\n\r\nSo why are we seeing this now?  There is likely some difference in the underlying Kafka client that was upgraded as part of #1490. I believe that is likely why we are starting to see the issue now on the feature branch, rather than in master.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThis change only impacts the integration tests.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis change merges the latest from master into the `feature/METRON-1856-parser-aggregation` feature branch. \r\n\r\nBecause of the age of this branch, this merge with master resulted in some merge conflicts. In addition, both UIs have major version updates to dependencies like Angular and Typescript. As a result, I had to update a few areas of the parser aggregation code to accommodate for stricter type checking.\r\n\r\nThis PR will show all of the commits from master that are being merged into the feature branch, followed by [a merge commit](https://github.com/apache/metron/commit/24f3b7198a18a89763d64b6b535f51a5235b7e78). After the merge commit, there are 2 commits. One is to apply an object property to a class that had been refactored in our parser aggregation work, and the other commit is to fix type errors resulting from stricter type checking.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nThe easiest way to do this is by building full dev from scratch, but another faster way is to navigate to the Management UI directory under `metron-interface/metron-config`, run the unit tests by running `ng test` and run  `ng build --prod` to ensure that the build passes.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

upgrades the feature branch `feature/METRON-2088-support-hdp-3.1` to HBase 2.0.2.  The scope of the changes include:\r\n\r\n* Replace `HBaseTestingUtility` API references that are no longer supported.\r\n* Replace references of `Put.add` with `Put.addColumn`.\r\n* Replaced references of `Cell.getQualifier` and `Cell.getValue`.\r\n* Update the `MockHTable` to function with HBase 2.0.2.\r\n* Update the Enrichment Coprocessor to reflect changes made in the coprocessor APIs.\r\n* Updated poms to reflect changes in the classpath after pulling in HBase 2.0.2.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\nThis PR should be tested using the centos7 development environment.  \r\n\r\n1. Start up the centos7 dev environment.\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/development/centos7\r\n    vagrant destroy -f\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Basics\r\n\r\nEnsure that we can continue to parse, enrich, and index telemetry.  Verify data is flowing through the system, from parsing to indexing\r\n\r\n1. Open Ambari and navigate to the Metron service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/METRON/summary\r\n\r\n1. Open the Alerts UI.  Verify alerts show up in the main UI - click the search icon (you may need to wait a moment for them to appear)\r\n\r\n1. Go to the Alerts UI and ensure that an ever increasing number of telemetry from Bro, Snort, and YAF are visible by watching the total alert count increase over time.\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that geoip enrichment is occurring.  The telemetry should contain fields like `enrichments:geo:ip_src_addr:location_point`.\r\n\r\n1. Head back to Ambari and select the Kibana service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/KIBANA/summary\r\n\r\n1. Open the Kibana dashboard via the \"Metron UI\" option in the quick links\r\n\r\n1. Verify the dashboard is populating\r\n\r\n###  Streaming Enrichments\r\n\r\n  1. Create a Streaming Enrichment [by following these instructions](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/2016/06/16/Metron+Tutorial+-+Fundamentals+Part+6%3A+Streaming+Enrichment).\r\n\r\n  1. Launch the Stellar REPL.\r\n      ```\r\n      source /etc/default/metron\r\n      cd $METRON_HOME\r\n      $METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Define the streaming enrichment and save it as a new source of telemetry.\r\n\r\n      ```\r\n      [Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT(conf)\r\n      {\r\n        \"parserClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.parsers.csv.CSVParser\",\r\n        \"writerClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.writer.hbase.SimpleHbaseEnrichmentWriter\",\r\n        \"sensorTopic\": \"user\",\r\n        \"parserConfig\": {\r\n          \"shew.table\": \"enrichment\",\r\n          \"shew.cf\": \"t\",\r\n          \"shew.keyColumns\": \"ip\",\r\n          \"shew.enrichmentType\": \"user\",\r\n          \"columns\": {\r\n            \"user\": 0,\r\n            \"ip\": 1\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      [Stellar]>>>\r\n      [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"PARSER\", conf, \"user\")\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Go to the Management UI and start the new parser called 'user'.\r\n\r\n  1. Create some test telemetry.\r\n      ```\r\n      [Stellar]>>> msgs := [\"user1,192.168.1.1\", \"user2,192.168.1.2\", \"user3,192.168.1.3\"]\r\n      [user1,192.168.1.1, user2,192.168.1.2, user3,192.168.1.3]\r\n      [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_PUT(\"user\", msgs)\r\n      3\r\n      [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_PUT(\"user\", msgs)\r\n      3\r\n      [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_PUT(\"user\", msgs)\r\n      3\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Ensure that the enrichments are persisted in HBase.\r\n      ```\r\n      [Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_GET('user', '192.168.1.1', 'enrichment', 't')\r\n      {original_string=user1,192.168.1.1, guid=a6caf3c1-2506-4eb7-b33e-7c05b77cd72c, user=user1, timestamp=1551813589399, source.type=user}\r\n\r\n      [Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_GET('user', '192.168.1.2', 'enrichment', 't')\r\n      {original_string=user2,192.168.1.2, guid=49e4b8fa-c797-44f0-b041-cfb47983d54a, user=user2, timestamp=1551813589399, source.type=user}\r\n\r\n      [Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_GET('user', '192.168.1.3', 'enrichment', 't')\r\n      {original_string=user3,192.168.1.3, guid=324149fd-6c4c-42a3-b579-e218c032ea7f, user=user3, timestamp=1551813589402, source.type=user}\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n### Enrichment Coprocessor\r\n\r\n  1. Confirm that the 'user' enrichment added in the previous section was 'found' by the coprocessor.\r\n        * Go to Swagger. \r\n        * Click the `sensor-enrichment-config-controller` option.\r\n        * Click the `GET /api/v1/sensor/enrichment/config/list/available/enrichments` option.\r\n\r\n  1. Click the \"Try it out!\" button. You should see a array returned with the value of each enrichment type that you have loaded.\r\n    ```\r\n    [\r\n      \"user\"\r\n    ]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Enrichment Stellar Functions in Storm\r\n\r\n  1. Follow [instructions similar to these](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/2016/04/28/Metron+Tutorial+-+Fundamentals+Part+2%3A+Creating+a+New+Enrichment) to load\r\n  the user data.\r\n\r\n  1. Create a simple file called `user.csv`.\r\n    ```\r\n    jdoe,192.168.138.2\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n  1. Create a file called `user-extractor.json`.\r\n      ```\r\n      {\r\n        \"config\": {\r\n          \"columns\": {\r\n            \"user\": 0,\r\n            \"ip\": 1\r\n          },\r\n          \"indicator_column\": \"ip\",\r\n          \"separator\": \",\",\r\n          \"type\": \"user\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"extractor\": \"CSV\"\r\n      }\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Import the data.\r\n      ```\r\n      source /etc/default/metron\r\n      $METRON_HOME/bin/flatfile_loader.sh -i ./user.csv -t enrichment -c t -e ./user-extractor.json\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1.

Test a profile in the REPL according to [these instructions](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-analytics/metron-profiler-repl#getting-started).\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> values := PROFILER_FLUSH(profiler)\r\n    [{period={duration=900000, period=1723089, start=1550780100000, end=1550781000000}, profile=hello-world, groups=[], value=4, entity=192.168.138.158}]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n#### Streaming Profiler\r\n \r\n1. Deploy that profile to the Streaming Profiler in Storm.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"PROFILER\", conf)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Wait for the Streaming Profiler in Storm to flush and retrieve the measurement from HBase.  \r\n\r\n    For the impatient, you can reset the period duration to 1 minute. Alternatively, you can allow the Profiler topology to work for a minute or two and then kill the `profiler` topology which will force it to flush a profile measurement to HBase.\r\n\r\n    Retrieve the measurement from HBase.  Prior to this PR, it was not possible to query HBase from the REPL.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"hello-world\",\"192.168.138.158\",PROFILE_FIXED(30,\"DAYS\"))\r\n    [2979]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR allows full dev deploy users to skip rpmlint processing via setting an environment variable.\r\n\r\nFor justification for excluding rpmlint from the build please see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2247\r\n\r\nThe PR contains the needed logic to tunnel an option variable from vagrant->ansible->docker to the shell script that actually runs rpmlint\r\n\r\nThe shell script has been modified to skip running rpmlint if the SKIP_RPMLINT environment variable has been sent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate this option for a single vagrant operation use:\r\n\r\n```\r\nenv ANSIBLE_ARGS='--extra-vars \"SKIP_RPMLINT=1\"' vagrant up\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo use the option permanently place the ANSIBLE_ARGS environment variable in your profile.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\nan exit 1 was added to the build script where the rpmlint command was being run. This causes the build process to die if rpmlint is being run. Running vagrant up without setting the `SKIP_RPMLINT` environment variable causes the build process to die.  Setting the variable  allows a full dev build to continue.\r\n\r\nA full dev build was done both with and without `SKIP_RPMLINT` being set to verify the Metron deploys fine either way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

change merges the latest from master into the `feature/METRON-2088-support-hdp-3.1` feature branch.  The most significant changes impacting the feature branch including METRON-2217 and METRON-2149.\r\n\r\nSince the merge with master resulted in some merge conflicts and additional changes to ensure that things continued to work, I want to open a PR for this work.  \r\n\r\nThis PR will show all of the commits from master that are being merged into the feature branch, followed by a merge commit.  After the merge commit, the last 5 commits are changes that I ultimately needed to make the merge successful.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\nThis PR should be tested using the centos7 development environment.  The feature branch is partially updated to work with HDP 3.1 at this point.  While Storm, Kafka, Zeppelin, and Solr have been updated HBase and Hadoop have not.  This means that only some functionality is working in the feature branch.  Anything that interacts with HBase and HDFS will most likely not work.\r\n\r\n1. Start up the centos7 dev environment.\r\n```\r\ncd metron-deployment/development/centos7\r\nvagrant destroy -f\r\nvagrant up\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\nWe need to turn off all enrichments that interact with HBase.  HBase is not yet functioning in the feature branch.\r\n\r\n1.  Stop the Enrichment topology.\r\n\r\n1. Launch the REPL.\r\n    ```\r\n    source /etc/default/metron\r\n    cd $METRON_HOME\r\n    bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1.  Run the following commands in the REPL which turns-off any enrichments that interact with HBase.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT()\r\n    {\r\n      \"enrichment\" : {\r\n        \"fieldMap\" : {\r\n          \"geo\" : [ \"ip_dst_addr\", \"ip_src_addr\" ]\r\n        },\r\n        \"fieldToTypeMap\" : { },\r\n        \"config\" : { }\r\n      },\r\n      \"threatIntel\" : {\r\n        \"fieldMap\" : {\r\n        },\r\n        \"fieldToTypeMap\" : {\r\n        },\r\n        \"config\" : { },\r\n        \"triageConfig\" : {\r\n          \"riskLevelRules\" : [ ],\r\n          \"aggregator\" : \"MAX\",\r\n          \"aggregationConfig\" : { }\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      \"configuration\" : { }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"ENRICHMENT\", conf, \"bro\")\r\n    [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"ENRICHMENT\", conf, \"yaf\")\r\n    [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"ENRICHMENT\", conf, \"snort\")\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. After the Enrichment topology has restarted, ensure that no errors are shown in the Storm UI.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Basics\r\n\r\nEnsure that we can continue to parse, enrich, and index telemetry.  Verify data is flowing through the system, from parsing to indexing\r\n\r\n1. Open Ambari and navigate to the Metron service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/METRON/summary\r\n\r\n1. Open the Alerts UI.  Verify alerts show up in the main UI - click the search icon (you may need to wait a moment for them to appear)\r\n\r\n1. Go to the Alerts UI and ensure that an ever increasing number of telemetry from Bro, Snort, and YAF are visible by watching the total alert count increase over time.\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that geoip enrichment is occurring.  The telemetry should contain fields like `enrichments:geo:ip_src_addr:location_point`.\r\n\r\n1. Head back to Ambari and select the Kibana service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/KIBANA/summary\r\n\r\n  1. Open the Kibana dashboard via the \"Metron UI\" option in the quick links\r\n\r\n  1. Verify the dashboard is populating\r\n\r\n### Profiler in the REPL\r\n\r\n1. Test a profile in the REPL according to [these instructions](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-analytics/metron-profiler-repl#getting-started).\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> values := PROFILER_FLUSH(profiler)\r\n    [{period={duration=900000, period=1723089, start=1550780100000, end=1550781000000}, profile=hello-world, groups=[], value=4, entity=192.168.138.158}]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nDocker bind shared folders have a reputation as being fairly slow and inefficient on Docker for Mac.  This project restructures the rpm-docker project to stop docker bind folders from being used by the RPM process for input and scratch pad use.  Docker bind folders are still used for output of the constructed RPMs. \r\n\r\nThis PR restructures the rpm-docker project to use a three-stage docker build process.  The first docker file is a template with the RPM building tools installed, that will be cached by docker once it is build.  \r\n\r\nThe second phase of the docker build process involves constructing a new docker image based on the 1st phase docker image plus the Metron jars.  \r\n\r\nThe third phase involves running the second phase docker image which will process the Metron Jars and place  the packaged rpms into the appropriate folders in the project directory.\r\n\r\n## Performance improvement.\r\nOn my 2019 MBP, the following performance improvement were obtained:\r\nUnmodified rpm-docker project:\r\n ```\r\nmvn package -DskipTests -T 2C -P HDP-2.5.0.0,mpack\r\ncd metron-deployment/\r\ntime mvn clean package -Pbuild-rpms -T 2C\r\n\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Reactor Summary:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] metron-deployment 0.7.2 ............................

Contributor Comments\r\nLink to ASF Jira ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2243\r\n\r\nThis PR updates a few direct dependencies and multiple nested dependencies in the Alerts and Management UIs due to vulnerabilities listed when running an `npm audit` report. I updated the dependencies using `npm audit fix`, which only updates to patch or minor versions of packages. In theory, this ensures we do not introduce breaking changes into the project.\r\n\r\nAfter using the command mentioned above, there is a single low severity vulnerability in a nested dependency for our unit test runner, Karma. You can read more about the vulnerability here: https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/786. Because of the low-risk nature of the issue, I chose not to bump this dependency to its next major version and risk the chance of introducing a breaking change. Whenever we update to Angular 8, this issue will be resolved (that version of Angular uses the next major version release of Karma).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nClone this branch and run `npm audit` in either of the UI application directories. The audit report should only show the low-level vulnerability mentioned above.\r\n\r\nSince this PR doesn't update anything but minor and patch releases of dependencies, there should be no changes in the appearance or behavior of either the Alerts or Management UI. Unit and e2e tests pass as expect, and a manual visual regression test will show no changes have been introduced into either UIs.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

the upgrade to Storm 1.2.1, there have been intermittent failures in the Storm Profiler integration tests.  \r\n\r\nThis integration test is the only one where multiple topologies are stopped and started during the test lifecycle. This is likely why it is only a problem for this test case.  The root cause is due to the way that the storm-kafka integration handles the Kafka consumer when a topology is stopped.   \r\n\r\nThis was identified as a bug in [STORM-3013](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-3013) and has been patched in storm-kafka version 1.2.3. This PR ensures that we are building against a build where this bug has been fixed.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\n- Run up Full Dev in centOS 7 and validate that alerts are visible in the Alerts UI.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR fixes a small regression in the streaming enrichments use case.  The issue happens specifically when a `org.apache.metron.writer.hbase.SimpleHbaseEnrichmentWriter` class is configured as the writer class in a parser topology.  The fix is to explicitly set the guava dependency to the version HBase depends on.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nSpin up full dev and configure a streaming enrichment.\r\n\r\n1. Create a `user` config with the writer set to `SimpleHbaseEnrichmentWriter`:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n \"parserClassName\" : \"org.apache.metron.parsers.csv.CSVParser\"\r\n ,\"writerClassName\" : \"org.apache.metron.writer.hbase.SimpleHbaseEnrichmentWriter\"\r\n ,\"sensorTopic\":\"user\"\r\n ,\"parserConfig\":\r\n {\r\n    \"shew.table\" : \"enrichment\"\r\n   ,\"shew.cf\" : \"t\"\r\n   ,\"shew.keyColumns\" : \"ip\"\r\n   ,\"shew.enrichmentType\" : \"user\"\r\n   ,\"columns\" : {\r\n      \"user\" : 0\r\n     ,\"ip\" : 1\r\n                }\r\n }\r\n}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/parser/config/user'\r\n```\r\n2. Start the `user` parser topology:\r\n```\r\nsource /etc/default/metron\r\n$METRON_HOME/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -s user -z $ZOOKEEPER -k $BROKERLIST\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Create a user topic and send enrichment data:\r\n```\r\n/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper $ZOOKEEPER  --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic user\r\necho \"user,192.168.1.1\" | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list $BROKERLIST --topic user\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere should be user enrichment data in hbase and no errors in the user parser topology.\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

METRON-2175, METRON-2176, METRON-2177 in HDP 3.1 upgrade feature branch\r\n\r\nThe initial approach taken when upgrading Metron to HBase 2.0.2 was to replace the `TableProvider` mechanism.  As part of this approach 3 PRs were introduced on the feature branch #1456, #1457, and #1458. Rather than attempt to replace the `TableProvider` mechanism, which causes broad impact to the code base, we explored an alternative approach of re-implementing the mock Table mechanism.  This PR reverts the initial 3 PRs that are no longer needed.  See this [discussion on the mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/59c965d360e239e160622564317b3274cbeef3908a6a4d7a73d1b11f@%3Cdev.metron.apache.org%3E) for more information.\r\n\r\nTo more easily review this PR, I would suggest that you review each commit individually.   The commits play out like so...\r\n1. Revert #1458 \r\n1. Revert #1457 \r\n1. Revert #1456 \r\n1. Merge in commits from the feature branch including #1490 and #1492 \r\n1. The remainder of the commits address classpath issues that were encountered after merging in the feature branch.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\nThis PR should be tested using the centos6 development environment.\r\n```\r\ncd metron-deployment/development/centos6\r\nvagrant destroy -f\r\nvagrant up\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Basics\r\n\r\nEnsure that we can continue to parse, enrich, and index telemetry.  Verify data is flowing through the system, from parsing to indexing\r\n\r\n  1. Open Ambari and navigate to the Metron service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/METRON/summary\r\n\r\n  1. Open the Alerts UI\r\n\r\n  1. Verify alerts show up in the main UI - click the search icon (you may need to wait a moment for them to appear)\r\n\r\n  1. Head back to Ambari and select the Kibana service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/KIBANA/summary\r\n\r\n  1. Open the Kibana dashboard via the \"Metron UI\" option in the quick links\r\n\r\n  1. Verify the dashboard is populating\r\n\r\n\r\n### REST\r\n\r\nIn addition, you can follow these steps to save and retrieve a user setting.\r\n\r\n1. Go to the Swagger UI.\r\n\r\n1. Retrieve the current user's settings using `GET /api/v1/alerts/ui/settings`. This should return 404 initially indicating there are no settings for the current user.\r\n\r\n1. Save a user setting.  Pass the following as the `alertsUIUserSettings` body to `POST /api/v1/alerts/ui/settings`.\r\n    ```\r\n    {\r\n      \"facetFields\": [\r\n        \"ip_src_addr\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"user\": \"admin\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Retrieve the setting again using `GET /api/v1/alerts/ui/settings`.  This should return 200 with the following response body\r\n    ```\r\n    {\r\n      \"user\": \"admin\",\r\n      \"tableColumns\": null,\r\n      \"savedSearches\": null,\r\n      \"facetFields\": [\r\n        \"ip_src_addr\"\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Profiler in the REPL\r\n\r\n1. Test a profile in the REPL according to [these instructions](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-analytics/metron-profiler-repl#getting-started).\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> values := PROFILER_FLUSH(profiler)\r\n    [{period={duration=900000, period=1723089, start=1550780100000, end=1550781000000}, profile=hello-world, groups=[], value=4, entity=192.168.138.158}]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Streaming Profiler\r\n \r\n1. Deploy that profile to the Streaming Profiler in Storm.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"PROFILER\", conf)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Wait for the Streaming Profiler in Storm to flush and retrieve the measurement from HBase.  \r\n\r\n    For the impatient, you can reset the period duration to 1 minute. Alternatively, you can allow the Profiler topology to work for a minute or two and then kill the `profiler` topology which will force it to flush a profile measurement to HBase.\r\n\r\n    Retrieve the measurement from HBase.  Prior to this PR, it was not possible to query HBase from the REPL.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"hello-world\",\"192.168.138.158\",PROFILE_FIXED(30,\"DAYS\"))\r\n    [2979]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Batch Profiler\r\n\r\n1. Install Spark using Ambari.\r\n\r\n    1. Stop Storm, YARN, Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Kafka.\r\n\r\n    1. Install Spark2 using Ambari.\r\n\r\n    1. Ensure that Spark can talk with HBase.\r\n        ```\r\n        cp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml /etc/spark2/conf/\r\n        ```\r\n\r\n1. Use the Batch Profiler to back-fill your profile.  To do this, follow the direction [provided here](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-analytics/metron-profiler-spark#getting-started).\r\n\r\n1. Retrieve the entire profile, including the back-filled data.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"hello-world\",\"192.168.138.158\",PROFILE_FIXED(30,\"DAYS\"))\r\n    [1203, 2849, 2900, 1944, 1054, 1241, 1721]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n###  Streaming Enrichments and Enrichment Stellar Functions in the REPL\r\n\r\n  1. Create a Streaming Enrichment [by following these instructions](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/2016/06/16/Metron+Tutorial+-+Fundamentals+Part+6%3A+Streaming+Enrichment).\r\n\r\n  1. Define the streaming enrichment and save it as a new source of telemetry.\r\n\r\n      ```\r\n      [Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT(conf)\r\n      {\r\n        \"parserClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.parsers.csv.CSVParser\",\r\n        \"writerClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.writer.hbase.SimpleHbaseEnrichmentWriter\",\r\n        \"sensorTopic\": \"user\",\r\n        \"parserConfig\": {\r\n          \"shew.table\": \"enrichment\",\r\n          \"shew.cf\": \"t\",\r\n          \"shew.keyColumns\": \"ip\",\r\n          \"shew.enrichmentType\": \"user\",\r\n          \"columns\": {\r\n            \"user\": 0,\r\n            \"ip\": 1\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      [Stellar]>>>\r\n      [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"PARSER\", conf, \"user\")\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1.

Contributor Comments\r\nWith full dev on slower systems ambari startup can take longer then the default 50 seconds.  This update tweaks the ansible setup scripts to change the timeout to 150 seconds.\r\n\r\nWhen run from the command line this appears as \r\n```\r\nWaiting for server start............................................................\r\n\r\nDB configs consistency check: no errors and warnings were found.\r\n\r\nERROR: Exiting with exit code 1.\r\n\r\nREASON: Server not yet listening on http port 8080 after 50 seconds. Exiting.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis shows itself during a full dev build as occasional errors during the Ansible setup script about an error occurred during the final phases of the full dev deployment, however logging onto Ambari server to identify what went wrong shows a server running fine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n1. Run full dev deploy\r\n2. Login to node1:8080 to verify Ambari has started successfully\r\n2. ssh onto dev box and check file `/etc/amabri-server/conf/ambari.properties`\r\nfor line `server.startup.web.timeout=150`\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nLink to ASF Jira ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2211\r\n\r\nCurrently, timestamps show in UTC time when the timestamp field is included as a column header. This PR adds a toggle button that, when switched on, will show timestamps relative to local time vs. UTC.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nOpen the Alerts UI and perform a search. Click on the Settings button (see the gif below) and click on the switch with the label `Convert timestamps to local time.` You should see the timestamps update accordingly. For example, I'm UTC +2, so you'll see in the gif below that the timestamps added 2 hours when the local switch was enabled.\r\n\r\n![local-time-switch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/63531114-1ab52480-c508-11e9-84d1-3464abdf4f8c.gif)\r\n\r\nThis feature references your OS' time settings, so feel free to update to another timezone and test that the timestamps update as they should. The timezone setting is kept in local storage, so a page reload should retain your settings.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR upgrades Solr from 6.6.2 to 7.4.0.  \r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n- Solr no longer throws an error for a facet query when two indices have different types defined for a facet field.  I had to split that test into separate integration tests for ES and Solr. \r\n- I refactored MetronSolrClient into a SolrClientFactory, more closely aligning with how we create clients in ES.  I also moved the code in MetronSolrClient that administers collections to SolrComponent since that is the only place it is used.\r\n- Updated our code to use the new Solr Client Kerberos API.\r\n- Adjusted pom.xml files to fix class path issues.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n1. Launch the centOS 7 development environment.\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/development/centos7\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that telemetry is visible within the Alerts UI.\r\n\r\n1. Stop Metron services, Elasticsearch and Kibana.\r\n\r\n1. Install Solr.\r\n    ```\r\n    source /etc/default/metron\r\n    cd $METRON_HOME\r\n    bin/install_solr.sh\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Define Solr Collections.\r\n    ```\r\n    source /etc/default/metron\r\n    export ZOOKEEPER=node1:9983\r\n    $METRON_HOME/bin/create_collection.sh bro\r\n    $METRON_HOME/bin/create_collection.sh snort\r\n    $METRON_HOME/bin/create_collection.sh yaf\r\n    $METRON_HOME/bin/create_collection.sh metaalert\r\n    $METRON_HOME/bin/create_collection.sh error\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Enable Solr by following [these instructions](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-platform/metron-solr/metron-solr-common#enabling-solr).\r\n\r\n1. Start Metron services.\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that telemetry is visible within the Alerts UI.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR upgrades the Kafka client dependency from 0.10.0.1 to 2.0.0 and the Storm dependency from 1.0.3 to 1.2.1. Overall this upgrade was pretty straightforward. The only complex changes involved upgrading the KafkaComponent class to use new Kafka admin and testing classes.\r\n\r\n@mmiklavc, all the comments you made on #1453 should be addressed here with the exception of excluding Storm.  I had to upgrade both Storm and Kafka versions or I get [this](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1488#issuecomment-523111756).\r\n\r\n@nickwallen, all the comments you made on #1488 should be addressed as well.\r\n\r\nTo isolate Kafka/Storm from the rest of the components, I upgraded these versions independently in all Maven profiles.  This will allow us to test newer client versions in full dev without having to upgrade all clients.  I created a [Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2223) to reconcile these once we complete the upgrade work.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nRight now I have only verified that it builds and tests pass.  I plan on running these tests in full dev:\r\n\r\nVerify full dev comes up without error and data is landing in ES\r\nVerify all REST Kafka functions are working as expected\r\nVerify all Stellar Kafka functions are working as expected\r\nVerify Kerberos\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR upgrades the Kafka client dependency from `0.10.0.1` to `2.0.0`.  Overall this upgrade was pretty straightforward.  The only complex changes involved upgrading the `KafkaComponent` class to use new Kafka admin and testing classes.\r\n\r\n@mmiklavc, all the comments you made on https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1453 should be addressed here.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n- Updated Kafka and Storm versions in Maven\r\n- Updated Maven pom files to include the correct dependency versions\r\n- Changed REST classes to use new Kafka client classes\r\n- Substituted Kafka constants for hardcoded strings\r\n- Upgraded to the KafkaComponent class to use new Kafka classes\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nI ran these tests in full dev:\r\n\r\n- Verified full dev comes up without error and data is landing in ES\r\n- Verified all REST Kafka functions are working as expected\r\n- Verified all Stellar Kafka functions are working as expected\r\n\r\nI am working on Kerberizing full dev and testing that Kafka still works as expected.  Will report back with those results soon.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nOne of the Stellar-common unit tests (testDateFormatDefaultTimezone), is coded in such a way that it will only work when the passed static point in time (variable 'epoch') is in in DST in the timezone of the machine running the test.  The passed time is in August 2016, which is DST for USA, but definitely not DST for Australia, so the test fails when run on a machine from that timezone.\r\n \r\nI've coded a fix for it now, but I'm very curious if anyone else has gotten burnt by this?  Anyone else around in the Southern Hemisphere?     \r\n\r\n... crickets ....\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, to reproduce the bug, just set your machine location to somewhere that does not experience DST in August (Southern Hemisphere is a good bet), and run \r\n```mvn clean test -pl metron-stellar/stellar-common```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

change upgrades the Streaming Enrichment Writer to work with HBase 2.0.2.\r\n* This PR is for the `feature/METRON-2088-support-HDP-3.1` feature branch.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n1. Updated Streaming Enrichments to use an `HBaseClient`.\r\n\r\n1. Updated Streaming Enrichments tests to use a `FakeHBaseClient`.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\n### Basics\r\n\r\n  Verify data is flowing through the system, from parsing to indexing\r\n\r\n  1. Open Ambari and navigate to the Metron service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/METRON/summary\r\n\r\n  1. Open the Alerts UI\r\n\r\n  1. Verify alerts show up in the main UI - click the search icon (you may need to wait a moment for them to appear)\r\n\r\n  1. Head back to Ambari and select the Kibana service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/KIBANA/summary\r\n\r\n  1. Open the Kibana dashboard via the \"Metron UI\" option in the quick links\r\n\r\n  1. Verify the dashboard is populating\r\n\r\n###  Streaming Enrichments and Enrichment Stellar Functions in the REPL\r\n\r\n  1. Create a Streaming Enrichment [by following these instructions](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/2016/06/16/Metron+Tutorial+-+Fundamentals+Part+6%3A+Streaming+Enrichment).\r\n\r\n  1. Define the streaming enrichment and save it as a new source of telemetry.\r\n\r\n      ```\r\n      [Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT(conf)\r\n      {\r\n        \"parserClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.parsers.csv.CSVParser\",\r\n        \"writerClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.writer.hbase.SimpleHbaseEnrichmentWriter\",\r\n        \"sensorTopic\": \"user\",\r\n        \"parserConfig\": {\r\n          \"shew.table\": \"enrichment\",\r\n          \"shew.cf\": \"t\",\r\n          \"shew.keyColumns\": \"ip\",\r\n          \"shew.enrichmentType\": \"user\",\r\n          \"columns\": {\r\n            \"user\": 0,\r\n            \"ip\": 1\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      [Stellar]>>>\r\n      [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"PARSER\", conf, \"user\")\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Go to the Management UI and start the new parser called 'user'.\r\n\r\n  1. Create some test telemetry.\r\n      ```\r\n      [Stellar]>>> msgs := [\"user1,192.168.1.1\", \"user2,192.168.1.2\", \"user3,192.168.1.3\"]\r\n      [user1,192.168.1.1, user2,192.168.1.2, user3,192.168.1.3]\r\n      [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_PUT(\"user\", msgs)\r\n      3\r\n      [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_PUT(\"user\", msgs)\r\n      3\r\n      [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_PUT(\"user\", msgs)\r\n      3\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1.

change upgrades the core Enrichment components to work with HBase 2.0.2.  This PR is for the `feature/METRON-2088-support-HDP-3.1` feature branch.\r\n\r\nThis change should be tested in the CentOS 6 dev environment with HDP-2.6.  These are backwards compatible HBase changes that require additional changes before everything can be compiled under HDP-3.1.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n1. Updates the `SensorEnrichmentConfigController` to use the HBase 2.0.2 APIs.  This component is part of the Enrichment Coprocessor mechanism.\r\n\r\n1. Updates the `HBaseCacheWriter` to use the HBase 2.0.2 APIs.  This component is part of the Enrichment Coprocessor mechanism.\r\n\r\n1. Removes the `LegacyHBaseClient` which uses the old, deprecated HBase APIs.  This was previously left in-place (in #1456) to allow the code base to continue to function as components were upgraded to HBase 2.0.2. \r\n\r\n## Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\n### Basics\r\n\r\n  Verify data is flowing through the system, from parsing to indexing\r\n\r\n  1. Launch the development environment.\r\n        ```\r\n        cd metron-deployment/development/centos6\r\n        vagrant up\r\n        ```\r\n\r\n  1. Open Ambari and navigate to the Metron service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/METRON/summary\r\n\r\n  1. Open the Alerts UI\r\n\r\n  1. Verify alerts show up in the main UI - click the search icon (you may need to wait a moment for them to appear)\r\n\r\n  1. Head back to Ambari and select the Kibana service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/KIBANA/summary\r\n\r\n  1. Open the Kibana dashboard via the \"Metron UI\" option in the quick links\r\n\r\n  1. Verify the dashboard is populating\r\n\r\n### Enrichment Coprocessor\r\n\r\n  1. Run the following command from the CLI - you should see the coprocessor in the table attributes. Ambari should set this up as part of the MPack installation.\r\n      ```\r\n      $ echo \"describe 'enrichment'\" | hbase shell\r\n\r\n      Table enrichment is ENABLED\r\n      enrichment, {TABLE_ATTRIBUTES => {coprocessor$1 => 'hdfs://node1:8020/apps/metron/coprocessor/metron-hbase-server-0.7.2-uber.jar|org.apache.metron.hbase.\r\n      coprocessor.EnrichmentCoprocessor||zookeeperUrl=node1:2181'}\r\n      COLUMN FAMILIES DESCRIPTION\r\n      {NAME => 't', VERSIONS => '1', EVICT_BLOCKS_ON_CLOSE => 'false', NEW_VERSION_BEHAVIOR => 'false', KEEP_DELETED_CELLS => 'FALSE', CACHE_DATA_ON_WRITE => '\r\n      false', DATA_BLOCK_ENCODING => 'NONE', TTL => 'FOREVER', MIN_VERSIONS => '0', REPLICATION_SCOPE => '0', BLOOMFILTER => 'ROW', CACHE_INDEX_ON_WRITE => 'fa\r\n      lse', IN_MEMORY => 'false', CACHE_BLOOMS_ON_WRITE => 'false', PREFETCH_BLOCKS_ON_OPEN => 'false', COMPRESSION => 'NONE', BLOCKCACHE => 'true', BLOCKSIZE\r\n      => '65536'}\r\n      1 row(s)\r\n      Took 5.9128 seconds\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Before we start adding enrichments, let's verify the enrichment_list table is empty\r\n\r\n  1. Go to Swagger\r\n\r\n  1. Click the `sensor-enrichment-config-controller` option.\r\n\r\n  1. Click the `GET /api/v1/sensor/enrichment/config/list/available/enrichments` option.\r\n\r\n  1. And finally click the \"Try it out!\" button. You should see an empty array returned in the response body.\r\n\r\n  1. Now, let's perform an enrichment load of some CSV data. We'll do this as the metron user\r\n      ```\r\n      su - metron\r\n      source /etc/default/metron\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Download the Alexa 1m dataset:\r\n      ```\r\n      wget http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexa-static/top-1m.csv.zip\r\n      unzip top-1m.csv.zip\r\n      head -10000 top-1m.csv > top-10k.csv\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Create an extractor.json for the CSV data by editing `extractor.json` and pasting in these contents:\r\n      ```\r\n      {\r\n        \"config\": {\r\n          \"columns\": {\r\n            \"domain\": 1,\r\n            \"rank\": 0\r\n          },\r\n          \"indicator_column\": \"domain\",\r\n          \"separator\": \",\",\r\n          \"type\": \"alexa\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"extractor\": \"CSV\"\r\n      }\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Import the data.\r\n      ```\r\n      $METRON_HOME/bin/flatfile_loader.sh -i /tmp/top-10k.csv -t enrichment -c t -e ./extractor.json\r\n      # count data written and verify it's 10k\r\n      echo \"count 'enrichment'\" | hbase shell\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Validate that the data was loaded.  Expect at least 10k records.\r\n      ```\r\n      echo \"count 'enrichment'\" | hbase shell\r\n      ```\r\n  1. Confirm that the enrichment added in the previous steps were 'found' by the coprocessor.\r\n        * Go to Swagger. \r\n        * Click the `sensor-enrichment-config-controller` option.\r\n        * Click the `GET /api/v1/sensor/enrichment/config/list/available/enrichments` option.\r\n\r\n  1. Click the \"Try it out!\" button. You should see a array returned with the value of each enrichment type that you have loaded.\r\n    ```\r\n    [\r\n      \"user\"\r\n    ]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
