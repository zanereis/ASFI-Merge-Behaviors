PR fixes a bug in convert_unpack().\r\nThis func currently convert `unpack(input, axis=0, num_packs=1)` into `squeeze(input, axis=None)`.\r\nHowever, this results in wrong results when `input` has multiple dimensions of size 1.\r\n\r\nFor example, when `input`'s shape is `(1, 3, 4, 1)` as I added in the test code, a converted relay outputs a tensor which shape is `(3, 4)`.\r\nBut, the correct output is `(3, 4, 1)`.\r\n\r\nTo fix this problem, I made a change to always use

now we are supporting two microtvm platforms (zephyr, arduino), it is confusing to use platform for both zephyr/arduino and the device target (e.g. qemu_x86/nrf5340dk and due/feathers2) that we support for each platform. This PR refactors the later platform to (arduino/zephyr)_board.\r\n\r\nThis PR also moves the supported microtvm devices for each platform to its microtvm_api_server.py to create a single source for

current GPU adaptive pool schedule doesn't parallelize across H and W dimensions. This is fine for spatially small inputs as in resnet, such as (1, 1024, 7, 7).  But recent architectures such as efficientnet applies adaptive (global) pooling on large inputs. In particular, efficientdet models from the [TF2 detection zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md) has workloads such as (1, 32, 378, 378). This results in the following sequential kernel and hence efficientdet models run extremely slow when converted to TVM.\r\n\r\n```\r\nextern \"C\" __global__ void __launch_bounds__(64) tvmgen_default_fused_nn_adaptive_avg_pool2d_kernel0(float* __restrict__ placeholder, float* __restrict__ tensor) {\r\n  float tensor1[1];\r\n  tensor1[(0)] = 0.000000e+00f;\r\n  for (int rv0 = 0; rv0 < 378; ++rv0) {\r\n    for (int rv1 = 0; rv1 < 378; ++rv1) {\r\n      if (((int)threadIdx.y) < 1) {\r\n        tensor1[(0)] = (tensor1[(0)] + placeholder[((((((((int)threadIdx.y) * 4572288) + (((int)blockIdx.x) * 1143072)) + (((int)threadIdx.x) * 142884)) + (rv0 * 378)) + rv1))]);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  if (((int)threadIdx.y) < 1) {\r\n    tensor[((((((int)threadIdx.y) * 32) + (((int)blockIdx.x) * 8)) + ((int)threadIdx.x)))] = (tensor1[(0)] * 6.998684e-06f);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI made two modifications to the adaptive pool schedule:\r\n* For the common case where the output size is (1, 1) (aka global pooling), adaptive pooling is equivalent to `sum(..., axis=[2, 3])`, for example. So the existing GPU reduction schedule should be used as is.\r\n* For other cases, simply parallelize across all axes. For example, when the output shape is `(N, C, pool_x, pool_y)`, we simply create N * C * pool_x * pool_y parallel work.

hit a bug in `LowerThreadallreduce` that was caused by two issues:\r\n* The `StorageRewrite` pass makes the storage of reduction output `reduce_temp0` reused by the next compute.  See `reduce_temp0[0] = ...` in the following example, which was originally `T_softmax_norm[0] = ...` before  `StorageRewrite`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\n... \r\ntir.tvm_thread_allreduce((uint32)1, normal_reduce_temp0[0], 1, reduce_temp0, threadIdx.x)\r\nif ((threadIdx.x < 16)) {\r\n   reduce_temp0[0] = (T_softmax_exp[threadIdx.x] / reduce_temp0[0])\r\n}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n*  `LowerThreadallreduce` doesn't remap the buffer variable of `Store` destination, unlike `Load`. Therefore, the output of `LowerThreadallreduce` looks something like this. Since the allocation for `reduce_temp0` is removed  by `LowerThreadallreduce`, this results in the use of undefined variable error.\r\n```\r\n...\r\nred_buf0[0] = tir.tvm_warp_shuffle(mask[0], red_buf0[0], 0, 32, 32)\r\nif ((threadIdx.x < 16)) {\r\n   reduce_temp0[0] = (T_softmax_exp[threadIdx.x] / red_buf0[0])        <<< reduce_temp0 is not declared\r\n}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, the storage destination is correctly remapped:\r\n```\r\n...\r\nred_buf0[0] = tir.tvm_warp_shuffle(mask[0], red_buf0[0], 0, 32, 32)\r\nif ((threadIdx.x < 16)) {\r\n  red_buf0[0] =

unification of GRU layer for frontends (#8781) the critical bag in GRU implementation on ONNX frontend side was observed. Inspite of unit test of GRU the bag was hidden by high tolerance (~1e-2) set for RNN tests. Moreover after bug fixing GRU unit test still requires high tolerance for correct pass. This fact was strange because local tests show very good coincidence with golden output from pytorch for any GRU modification (~1e-7).\r\n1. I checked LSTM tests: tolerance 1e-6 is enough in most cases but sometimes it needs 1e-5 (it is tolerance for other operations tested for onnx frontend).\r\n2. Bug in GRU was localized and fixed. it was related to implementation of specific GRU modification.\r\n3. tolerance for RNN tests were reduced from 1e-2 to 1e-5\r\n4. Random seed was added for GRU test.

the issue reported in https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/pytorch-layout-cannot-convert-f-linear-x-f-linear-y-z/10866/\r\n\r\nCurrently, `dense` op's input layouts are `NC` and `NK` for data and weight respectively. This causes an issue when the output of `dense` is used as the weight for another `dense`. We get \"Incompatible layouts: NC vs NK\" error. \r\n\r\nThere is no need to distinguish the second dim of `data` and `weight`, since both must be the same value.

the bug mentioned in https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/cannot-list-attrs-of-tvm-ir-array-via-dir/10924\r\n\r\nEvery time when we try to register a node, the size of `fvisit_attrs_` will increase, and there are no other operations to unregister these nodes, so if `tindex < fvisit_attrs_.size()` is true, it means that the node has been registered.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\ntemplate <typename T, typename TraitName>\r\ninline ReflectionVTable::Registry ReflectionVTable::Register() {\r\n  uint32_t tindex = T::RuntimeTypeIndex();\r\n  if (tindex >= fvisit_attrs_.size()) {\r\n    fvisit_attrs_.resize(tindex + 1, nullptr);\r\n    fcreate_.resize(tindex + 1, nullptr);\r\n    frepr_bytes_.resize(tindex + 1, nullptr);\r\n    fsequal_reduce_.resize(tindex + 1, nullptr);\r\n    fshash_reduce_.resize(tindex + 1, nullptr);\r\n  }\r\n  // functor that implements the redirection.\r\n  fvisit_attrs_[tindex] = ::tvm::detail::SelectVisitAttrs<T, TraitName>::VisitAttrs;\r\n\r\n  fsequal_reduce_[tindex] = ::tvm::detail::SelectSEqualReduce<T, TraitName>::SEqualReduce;\r\n\r\n  fshash_reduce_[tindex] = ::tvm::detail::SelectSHashReduce<T, TraitName>::SHashReduce;\r\n\r\n  return Registry(this, tindex);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore, I just use the `tindex >= fvisit_attrs_.size()` to determine whether it has been registered. And if `fvisit_attrs_[tindex] != nullptr` exists, I will execute `fvisit_attrs_[tindex](self, visitor);` to get its attribute.\r\n\r\n@junrushao1994 @comaniac

I use the relay VM to compile a graph that contains a huge for loop, the LabelOps pass encountered stack overflow. This problem is caused by the LabelOps applies the default `ExprMutator::VisitExpr_(const LetNode* op)` function to visit the LetNode, which is a recursive function.\r\n\r\nHere is a small testing case:\r\n``` python3\r\ndata = relay.var(\"data\", tvm.ir.TensorType(shape = (relay.Any(),5,2), dtype = \"float32\"))\r\nshape = relay.op.shape_of(data)\r\n\r\nfor i in range(1000):\r\n    tmp = relay.op.ones(shape, \"float32\")\r\n    shape = relay.op.shape_of(tmp)\r\nres = shape\r\n\r\nmod = tvm.IRModule()\r\nmod[\"main\"] = relay.Function([data], res)\r\n```\r\nIn this case, I set the for

this PR, I add `InferType` to the end of `LowerTEPass` so we don't have to call it after we call `LowerTEPass`. I also remove `per_target_modules_` from the interpreter.\r\n\r\nTo do this, I did have to fix a few bugs, namely:\r\n- Make sure we copy the attributes of the `IRModule` when we soft-copy the `IRModule`\r\n- In the type inferencer, we lookup `GlobalVars` by name, not by pointer address\r\n- In the type inferencer, if we encounter a `tir::PrimFunc`, we skip the function instead of failing (this allows us to call InferType on the unified module which contains both `relay::Functions` and `tir::PrimFuncs`)\r\n\r\nThis is follow up work from #8886\r\n\r\n(Also note that although the branch is called remove-lowered-output, I don't actually remove LoweredOutput in this PR. I started to but there was some other cleanup I needed to do

Bug Description\r\n\r\nI found there will be a segfault when we try to load a buffer whose `data_` points to `nullptr`.\r\n\r\nHere is the code to trigger the segmentation fault error.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport tvm\r\nfrom tvm import tir\r\n\r\nvar = tir.Var('a',dtype='int32')\r\nbuf = tir.decl_buffer((1,), name='buf')\r\nbuf_load = tir.expr.BufferLoad(buffer=buf, indices=tvm.runtime.convert([0]))\r\nbuf_load_stmt = tir.stmt.Evaluate(buf_load)\r\nfor_loop = tir.stmt.For(loop_var=var, kind=1, min_val=1, extent=buf_load, body=buf_load_stmt)\r\nbuf_func = tir.PrimFunc(params={}, body=for_loop)\r\n\r\ntvm.lower(buf_func)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n(tvm-build) ➜  ~ vim buffer_nullptr.py\r\n(tvm-build) ➜  ~ python3 buffer_nullptr.py\r\n[1]    28338 segmentation fault (core dumped)  python3 buffer_nullptr.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Bug Analysis\r\n\r\nIf we call the function `tvm.build(buf_func)`, it will execute `Buffer::vload()` in [src/tir/ir/buffer.cc](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/src/tir/ir/buffer.cc#L294):\r\n```c++\r\nPrimExpr Buffer::vload(Array<PrimExpr> begin, DataType dtype) const {\r\n  // specially handle bool, stored as DataType::Int(8)\r\n  const BufferNode* n = operator->();\r\n  ICHECK(dtype.element_of() == n->dtype.element_of() && dtype.lanes() % n->dtype.lanes() == 0)\r\n      << \"Cannot load \" << dtype << \" from buffer of \" << n->dtype;\r\n  if (dtype == DataType::Bool()) {\r\n    return tir::Cast(DataType::Bool(),\r\n                     tir::Load(DataType::Int(8), n->data, BufferOffset(n, begin, DataType::Int(8)),\r\n                               const_true()));\r\n  } else {\r\n    return tir::Load(dtype, n->data, BufferOffset(n, begin, dtype), const_true(dtype.lanes()));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince `n` might be `nullptr`, `n->dtype.element_of()` will actually access the illegal memory address, then a segfault occurs.\r\n\r\nSo to prevent illegal memory access, it's necessary to add a checker to check whether `n` points to a valid object. And I also found the similar checkers had been added into TVM such as line 40 in [include/tvm/ir/env_func.h](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/include/tvm/ir/env_func.h#L140):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25731241/131886066-5d9a0f09-45f7-4fb8-b741-2d9919d35824.png)\r\n\r\nThus, I add the checker in `src/tir/ir/buffer.cc` to prevent illegal memory access in this commit.\r\n\r\nAs `tvm::tir::Buffer` extends from `tvm::runtime::Object`, it can also solve the problem by adding the checkers to `tvm::runtime::Object`.","created_at":"2021-09-02T17:09:43Z","updated_at":"2021-09-09T05:43:24Z","closed_at":"2021-09-09T05:43:15Z","merged_at":"2021-09-09T05:43:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"eac4763bb3bad805a46b01df5ea6799e65bbd9d3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kparzysz-quic","id":48801706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODAxNzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48801706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic","html_url":"https://github.com/kparzysz-quic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"vinx13","id":7195739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13","html_url":"https://github.com/vinx13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ZihengJiang","id":17693755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjkzNzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17693755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihengJiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"areusch","id":53295

op fusion is not enabled for `softmax` op. This has been fine for imagenet models where `softmax` is only used at the end. But transformer models use a lot of softmax in the middle. \r\n\r\nWhen the FP16 conversion is applied, `softmax` is always left fp32, so there are always a lot of `cast(softmax_output, dtype=\"float16\")` after the conversion. Since `softmax` and `cast` cannot be fused, we end up a lot of inefficient \"cast only\" kernels: https://gist.github.com/masahi/0d7d96ae88722b616a906cec2054559e#file-transformer-txt-L37-L43 \r\n\r\nThis PR changes `softmax` op's fuse pattern, so that it can be fused with following elemwise / injective ops, just like conv2d etc. Topi schedules have also been updated to take fused ops into account. \r\n\r\ncc @yzhliu @comaniac @AndrewZhaoLuo @mbrookhart

PR aims to make the unit test suite run with `TVM_TEST_TARGETS=\"vulkan -from_device=0\"`.  This PR applies a few minor fixes, parametrizes several topi unit tests that were previously failing, and marks the specific failing cases with xfail.  The failing cases will be tracked in https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8903.\r\n\r\n[UnitTest][Topi] Parametrized several unit tests, identify vulkan failures\r\n\r\n- Parametrized topi modules\r\n  - test_topi_conv1d_transpose_ncw.py\r\n  - test_topi_conv2d_nhwc.py\r\n  - test_topi_correlation.py\r\n  - test_topi_loss.py\r\n  - test_topi_math.py\r\n  - test_topi_reduce.py\r\n  - test_topi_softmax.py\r\n  - test_topi_sort.py\r\n  - test_topi_unique.py\r\n  - test_topi_vision.py\r\n\r\n- Unit Tests fixed\r\n\r\n  - `test_topi_loss::test_nll_loss`, failure due to `supports_float64` not being passed from the target to the codegen.\r\n\r\n- Known Vulkan failures (tracked in https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8903)\r\n\r\n  - test_topi_math.py::test_ewise, [\"tan\", \"erf\", \"isnan\", \"isfinite\", \"isinf\"]\r\n\r\n    Unimplemented CallNode operations\r\n\r\n  - test_topi_reduce.py::test_reduce_map, [\"sum\", \"any\", \"all\"]\r\n\r\n    Fails during codegen, unexpected size of data type.\r\n\r\n  - test_topi_vision.py::test_proposal\r\n\r\n    Marked test_proposal as xfail on vulkan, currently has a type error between bool/int8.\r\n\r\n  - test_topi_conv1d_transpose_ncw.py::test_conv1d_transpose_ncw\r\n\r\n    Incorrect numeric output, a few elements outside of allowed tolerance, only occurs on vulkan backend.\r\n\r\n  - test_softmax.py::test_softmax\r\n\r\n    Marked float64 operations as xfail in vulkan, because GLSL.std.450 only supports 16/32-bit floats.\r\n\r\n\r\n[UnitTests][Vulkan] Improved robustness of test_tir_intrin::test_clz\r\n\r\nPreviously, would fail during build since support for Int64 primitives wasn't declared in the `\"vulkan\"` target.

unit tests in the contrib directory have not been running in CI (see https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8901 for tracking issue).  This PR re-enables these tests, and marks any regressions with `xfail`.\r\n\r\n[Pytest][TensorRT] Mark the TensorRT tests with tvm.testing.requires_cuda\r\n    \r\n- Previously, the tests had an early bailout if tensorrt was disabled, or if there was no cuda device present.  However, the tests were not marked with `pytest.mark.gpu` and so they didn't run during `task_python_integration_gpuonly.sh`.  This commit adds the `requires_cuda` mark, and maintains the same behavior of testing the tensorrt compilation steps if compilation is enabled, and running the results if tensorrt is enabled.\r\n    \r\n- In addition, some of the tests result in failures when run.  These have been marked with `pytest.mark.xfail`, and are being tracked in issue #8901.\r\n\r\n\r\n[UnitTests][CoreML] Marked test_annotate as a known failure.\r\n    \r\nThe unit tests in `test_coreml_codegen.py` haven't run in the CI lately, so this test wasn't caught before.  (See tracking issue #8901).\r\n    \r\n- Added `pytest.mark.xfail` mark to `test_annotate`.\r\n\r\n- Added `tvm.testing.requires_package` decorator, which can mark tests as requiring a specific python package to be available.  Switched from `pytest.importorskip('coremltools')` to `requires_package('coremltools')` in `test_coreml_codegen.py` so that all tests would explicitly show up as skipped in the report.\r\n\r\n- Added `uses_gpu` tag to all tests in `test_coreml_codegen.py`, since only ci_gpu has coremltools installed.  In the future, if the ci_cpu image has coremltools installed, this mark can be removed.","created_at":"2021-09-01T16:42:56Z","updated_at":"2021-09-02T21:01:57Z","closed_at":"2021-09-02T19:10:28Z","merged_at":"2021-09-02T19:10:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"aac0754ed639358af2ad533159745a7b4ff416d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0ND

PR adds a new analysis function named `GetBlockReadWriteRegion` for TIR, which collects all buffer regions that a given block reads from and writes to.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, there was an existed function named `GetBlockAccessRegion` which collects three kinds of accesses: read accesses, write accesses, and opaque accesses. This function is only responsible for _reflecting the true access patterns of the given block_. That is, for example, suppose that `A` is a buffer of shape `[128]`, and there's an external function call `tir.call_extern(\"test\", A.data, A[vi])` in the input block. The result of `GetBlockAccessRegion` says \"the input block has a read access to `A[vi:vi + 1]` and an opaque access to `A[0:128]`\".\r\n\r\nTo create a block's `read`/`write` fields, we need to merge the read/write accesses with the opaque accesses of the block respectively. Continue the example above. Merging accesses means telling that \"the block reads from `A[0:128]` and writes to `A[0:128]`\". We leave out the read access `A[vi:vi + 1]` in the merging as it's covered by the opaque access. The \"merging\" is exactly what `GetBlockReadWriteRegion` does.\r\n\r\nAfter introducing `GetBlockReadWriteRegion`, whenever people want to generate the `read`/`write` fields of a block, or want to collect the read/write regions regarding opaque accesses as both read and write accesses, they can just invoke `GetBlockReadWriteRegion` - no need to call `GetBlockAccessRegion` and then merge the accesses.\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\ncc @Hzfengsy @junrushao1994 @tqchen

implementing this, I'm somewhat mixed, and would like to hear what others think.  This PR allows a new entry to be added to the `tvm.support.libinfo()` dictionary with a single-line change in `LibInfo.cmake`.  However, it does so by generating the C++ source code on the fly, and I'm unsure if that's a good idea or not.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\n* Previously, exposing a cmake build variable to the compiled program required adding a new `-D` define macro in `LibInfo.cmake`,\r\nconditionally setting the `#define` in `libinfo.cc`, then adding it into the list returned by `GetLibInfo`.  With this commit, additional cmake build variables can be exposed by adding to the list passed when generating `libinfo.cc`.\r\n\r\n* Simplifies the CMakeLists.txt, because libinfo no longer needs to

#8758 changed the way AOT is handled in microTVM, which caused my Arduino PR to stop working. I should have been caught by the unit tests since it caused Arduino project compilation to stop working, but because I called `subprocess.run` in `microtvm_api_server.py` without passing `check=True`, the tests still pass.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the Arduino implementation of microTVM, changes the unit tests for Arduino to use `check=True`, and adds a regression test to make sure the unit tests will

while back @mbrookhart and I implemented the `onnx_input` class to support accessing inputs by index or name. However, it turned out that onnx node names are inconsistent and shouldnt be used. Although all tests have been updated to access inputs only by index, the `onnx_input` class maintained support for names which could allow errors to slip in if used. This PR removes that capability. Instead `onnx_input` is now a simple wrapper around `list` that returns `None` when indices are out of range. This is useful since Onnx often does not provide inputs in lieu of using a None value.\r\n\r\nI also snuck in a change to where the `Celu` converter is since it was placed in the wrong region of the

old workload key uses an md5 hash of the string representation of the computational DAG. This gives the question of what to do when we have a hash collision. This change lets us dump a file in `extract_tasks` associating the workload key (e.g. hash + other things) with the printed version of the dag. \r\n\r\nWe also provide a way to modify the hashing function being used.\r\n\r\nFinally we have a common bug where to construct the workload key, we append the size of input tensors to the DAG. However we were appending each integer part of the shape into one big list instead of appending the tuple. This fixes this too. E.g. we have [1, 1], [3, 4, 5, 6] instead of [1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\nRan the autotuning tutorials https://tvm.apache.org/docs/tutorials/auto_scheduler/tune_network_cuda.html and made sure it works.\r\n\r\nUnit

PR adds support for llvm/llc parameter `-mabi` (aka `-target-abi`).\r\n\r\nTarget/Machine ABI parameter is needed to compile models for RISC-V cpu.\r\nRISC-V has six ABIs - `ilp32`, `ilp32f`, `ilp32d`, `lp64`, `lp64f`, `lp64d`.\r\n\r\nCPU example is [sifive-u54 (llvm)](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/d480f968ad8b56d3ee4a6b6df5532d485b0ad01e/llvm/include/llvm/Support/RISCVTargetParser.def#L23), [sifive-u54 (gcc)](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc/blob/c3911e6425f35e0722129cb30cc5ccaf3390cd75/gcc/config/riscv/riscv-cores.def#L46)\r\n\r\nSpecifying just `mcpu=sifive-u54` parameter is not enough since particular CPU can be used on platforms with different ABIs.  \r\nWhen we compile the model we also need to specify target/machine ABI. For example `-mabi=lp64d`.\r\n\r\nTarget string example:\r\n```\r\nllvm -mtriple=riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu -mcpu=sifive-u54 -mabi=lp64d -device=arm_cpu\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we do not specify `-mabi=lp64d`  then the linking process (`lib.export_library`) which generates `model.so` will fail with the following error\r\n```\r\ncan't link soft-float modules with double-float modules\r\n```\r\nThe compilation and export_library was tested for `relay.build` single output (GraphExecutorFactoryModule) and for three outputs (graph, lib, params).\r\n\r\nI also added several popular RISC-V CPUs to `tvm.target` module.\r\n```\r\nsifive-e31\r\nsifive-e76\r\nsifive-u54\r\nsifive-u74\r\n```\r\nAbout the parameter name. The name is different in gcc and llc:\r\n`gcc` uses `-mabi` but `llc` uses `-target-abi` (`llc` parameter is hidden (not in the help)).\r\n\r\nRelated discussion:

this PR, I have fixed two bugs:\r\n1. Incorrectly detect access region for opaque access in `PlanAndUpdateBufferAllocationLocation`\r\n    Currently, the pass `PlanAndUpdateBufferAllocationLocation` will re-calculate the access region. It will enlarge the access region even though with manually specified access regions. Actually, the only thing we should do is erase the buffers allocated inside the block. \r\n2. Incorrectly analyze the buffer access region created by `match_buffer`.\r\n   `block_access_region_detector` will only detector buffers in the given map. As for the buffer created by `match_buffer`, we SHOULD only consider the buffers whose source buffer is in the given map. But we detect all buffers created by `match_buffer` by mistake. Also, the previous testcase is incorrect, so we can pass it even the logic is wrong.\r\n\r\nThanks @MasterJH5574 for reporting this

for issue #8616.\r\nThanks for @tqchen @CallahanRL\r\n\r\nThe rule in `FloorDiv`\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/f1ca91d4e401096d04e962c982d62b1f2669c9f5/src/arith/rewrite_simplify.cc#L733-L742\r\nis correct, and for some mistake(oh it's my fault), the similar rule in `FloorMod` missed the coeff range check.\r\n\r\nThis rule is important when there're complicated fuse & reorder in axis, but the correct cases are actually quite narrow.\r\n\r\nTo simplify a `[b1, b1 + c1, ..., b1 + (lanes - 1) * c1] % c2` to `b1 % c2 + [0, c1, ..., (lanes - 1) * c1]`, the correct constraint is all of `[b1, b1 + c1, ..., b1 + (lanes - 1) * c1] / c2` must be same.\r\n\r\nWhile by modular set analyse, we can only assert the expression matches`c2val % bmod->coeff == 0 && bmod->base + (lanes.Eval() - 1) * c1val < bmod->coeff` result in a same FloorDiv
