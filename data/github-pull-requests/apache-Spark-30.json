This would be OK in practice, since the moment the marker for isStreaming would be useful is to look into the plan which is already analyzed - that said, itâ€™s unlikely that we need to see the both one of existing marker and the marker for streaming.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis would help tracking down QO issues happening with streaming query much easier. For example, here is the example of the rule which triggered [SPARK-47305](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-47305):\r\n\r\n```\r\n=== Applying Rule org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.PruneFilters ===\r\n WriteToMicroBatchDataSource MemorySink, 49358516-bb57-4f10-badf-00c9f5e2484b, Append, 1   WriteToMicroBatchDataSource MemorySink, 49358516-bb57-4f10-badf-00c9f5e2484b, Append, 1\r\n +- Project [value#45]                                                                     +- Project [value#45]\r\n    +- Join Inner                                                                             +- Join Inner\r\n       :- Project [value#45]                                                                     :- Project [value#45]\r\n       :  +- StreamingDataSourceV2ScanRelation[value#45] MemoryStreamDataSource                  :  +- StreamingDataSourceV2ScanRelation[value#45] MemoryStreamDataSource\r\n       +- Project                                                                                +- Project\r\n!         +- Filter false                                                                           +- LocalRelation <empty>, [id#54L]\r\n!            +- Range (1, 5, step=1, splits=Some(2))          \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe bug of SPARK-47305 was, LocalRelation in above was \"incorrectly\" marked as `streaming=true` where it should be `streaming=false`. There is no notion of isStreaming flag in the text representation of LocalRelation, hence from the text plan we would never know the rule had a bug. Even though we assume we show the value of isStreaming in LocalRelation, the depth of subtree could be huge in practice and it's not friendly to go down to the leaf node to figure out the isStreaming value of the entire subtree.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, the above rule information will be changed as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n=== Applying Rule org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.PruneFilters ===\r\n ~WriteToMicroBatchDataSource MemorySink, dcf936d0-8580-47e9-b898-4fffffc21db5, Append, 1   ~WriteToMicroBatchDataSource MemorySink, dcf936d0-8580-47e9-b898-4fffffc21db5, Append, 1\r\n +- ~Project [value#45]                                                                     +- ~Project [value#45]\r\n    +- ~Join Inner                                                                             +- ~Join Inner\r\n       :- ~Project [value#45]                                                                     :- ~Project [value#45]\r\n       :  +- StreamingDataSourceV2ScanRelation[value#45] MemoryStreamDataSource                   :  +- StreamingDataSourceV2ScanRelation[value#45] MemoryStreamDataSource\r\n!      +- Project                                                                                 +- ~Project\r\n!         +- Filter false                                                                            +- ~LocalRelation <empty>, [id#54L]\r\n!            +- Range (1, 5, step=1, splits=Some(2))                     \r\n```\r\n\r\nNow it's obvious that isStreaming flag of leaf node had changed. Also, to check the isStreaming flag of children for Join, we just need to look at the first node of subtree for children, instead of going down to leaf nodes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, since the textual representation of logical plan will be changed a bit. But it's only applied to the streaming Dataset, and also the textual representation of logical plan is arguably not a public API. (Keeping backward compatibility of the text is technically very hard.)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting UTs for regression test on batch and streaming query. For streaming query, this PR updated the golden file to match with the change.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-06-12T08:02:52Z","updated_at":"2024-06-17T00:18:42Z","closed_at":"2024-06-17T00:18:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2eac922f0719311e90b1ab6a3d059a7c56666862","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46953/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46953/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46953/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f2e2edf6ec5a8a10fa0f38491dadf06c4d2f3bfb","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-48597","ref":"SPARK-48597","sha":"f2e2edf6ec5a8a10fa0f38491dadf06c4d2f3bfb","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR defines two new options, snapshotStartBatchId and snapshotPartitionId, for the existing state reader. Both of them should be provided at the same time.\r\n1. When there is no snapshot file at `snapshotStartBatch` (note there is an off-by-one issue between version and batch Id), throw an exception.\r\n2. Otherwise, the reader should continue to rebuild the state by reading delta files only, and ignore all snapshot files afterwards.\r\n3. Note that if a `batchId` option is already specified. That batchId is the ending batchId, we should then end at that batchId.\r\n4. This feature supports state generated by HDFS state store provider and RocksDB state store provider with changelog checkpointing enabled. **It does not support RocksDB with changelog disabled which is the default for RocksDB.**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSometimes when a snapshot is corrupted, users want to bypass it when reading a later state. This PR gives user ability to specify the starting snapshot version and partition. This feature can be useful for debugging purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nCreated test cases for testing edge cases for the input of new options. Created test for the new public function `replayReadStateFromSnapshot`. Created integration test for the new options against four stateful operators: limit, aggregation, deduplication, stream-stream join. Instead of generating states within the tests which is unstable, I prepare golden files for the integration test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-11T20:29:33Z","updated_at":"2024-07-02T20:16:39Z","closed_at":"2024-07-02T20:16:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7cdb262b6c1b419fd5e079b232fc27d3a603a840","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen change log checkpointing is enabled, the lock of the **RocksDB** state store is acquired when uploading the snapshot inside maintenance tasks, which causes lock contention between query processing tasks and state maintenance thread. This PR fixes lock contention issue introduced by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45724. \r\n\r\nThe changes include:\r\n1. Removing lock acquisition in `doMaintenance()`\r\n2. Adding a `copyFileMappings()` method to **RocksDBFileManager**,  and using this method to deep copy the file manager state, specifically the file mappings `versionToRocksDBFiles` and `localFilesToDfsFiles`,  in `load()`\r\n3. Capture the reference to the file mappings  in `commit()`.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe want to eliminate lock contention to decrease latency of streaming queries so lock acquisition inside maintenance tasks should be avoided. This can introduce race conditions between task and maintenance threads. By making a deep copy of `versionToRocksDBFiles` and `localFilesToDfsFiles` in **RocksDBFileManager**, we can ensure that the file manager state is not updated by task thread when background snapshot uploading tasks attempt to upload a snapshot.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPreviously, if `variant_get` returned a Variant or a nested type containing Variant, we would just return the slice of the value along with the full metadata. Typically, most of the metadata is relevant to other parts of the original Variant value, and is not needed, so the resulting binary is larger than needed. This can be very expensive if the value is written to disk (e.g. parquet or shuffle file).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAvoid unnecessarily large Variant values in memory and on disk.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the resulting Variant is logically the same as before, only storage size should change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-06-11T18:03:33Z","updated_at":"2024-06-17T05:26:49Z","closed_at":"2024-06-17T05:26:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"18de1ec7269fe22413a17b0d7abd64c552d0f700","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46941/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46941/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46941/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3dbab92491e617ee1549595219152bcaa2c3534e","head":{"label":"cashmand:SPARK-48587","ref":"SPARK-48587","sha":"3dbab92491e617ee1549595219152bcaa2c3534e","user":{"login":"cashmand","id":54722026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzIyMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54722026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand","html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":469837514,"node_id":"R_kgDOHAEmyg","name":"spark","full_name":"cashmand/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cashmand","id":54722026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzIyMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54722026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand","html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR improves perf for unescapePathName with algorithms briefly described as:\r\n- If a path contains no '%' or contains '%' at `position > path.length-2`, we return the original identity instead of creating a new StringBuilder to append char by char\r\n- Otherwise, we loop with 2 indices, `plaintextStartIdx` which starts from 0 and then points to the next char after resolving `%xx`, and `plaintextEndIdx` which points to the next `'%'`. `plaintextStartIdx` moves to `plaintextEndIdx + 3` if `%xx` is valid, or moves to `plaintextEndIdx + 1` if `%xx` is invalid. \r\n- Instead of using Integer.parseInt with error capture, we identify the high and low characters manually. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nperformance improvement for hotspots\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- new tests in ExternalCatalogUtilsSuite\r\n- Benchmark

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd consistency check for mapIds between the push-merged block meta from the server side and the mapTracker on the driver side for reduce tasks. If any mapIds is found missing in the chunk meta, fallback to fetching original shuffle blocks.\r\nThis end-to-end check helps to avoid issues of data loss during the shuffle read phase when reduce tasks fetch merged data.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nShuffleBlockFetcherIterator initializes requests based on the mergeStatus and mapStatus from the driver side, where the mergeStatus's mapTracker (partition level bitmap) comes from the mapTracker maintained in the shuffle service's memory. but the actual mapIds for fetching chunk data come from the shuffle service's metaFile. There is no consistency check between the two. \r\nWhen the server encounters issues such as disk failures, it may cause inconsistencies in mapIds between the mapTracker and the metaFile. This ultimately results in data loss when reduce tasks fetch merged data.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-06-11T06:55:58Z","updated_at":"2024-12-15T00:47:13Z","closed_at":"2024-09-29T00:26:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e43368cd38323a8dd90b7ee24827a2d11ceb5f72","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46934/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46934/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46934/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/32bcc856e7e6b167da6eac21965922cc0c57fc59","head":{"label":"gaoyajun02:SPARK-48580","ref":"SPARK-48580","sha":"32bcc856e7e6b167da6eac21965922cc0c57fc59","user":{"login":"gaoyajun02","id":81629032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNjI5MDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81629032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02","html_url":"https://github.com/gaoyajun02","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":358891084,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTg4OTEwODQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"gaoyajun02/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gaoyajun02","id":81629032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNjI5MDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81629032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02","html_url":"https://github.com/gaoyajun02","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gaoyajun02/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR implements a small architecture change for the server side listenerBusListener. Before, when the first `addListener` call reaches to the server, there is a thread created, and there is a latch to hold this thread long running. This is to prevent this thread from returning, which would send a `ResultComplete` to the client, and closes the client receiving iterator. In client side listener we need to keep the iterator open all the time (until the last `removeListener` call) to keep receiving events.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we delegate the sending of the final `ResultComplete` to the listener thread itself. Now the thread doesn't need to be held stuck. This would 1. remove a hanging thread running on the server and 2. Shield the listener from being effected by `spark.interruptAll`.\r\n\r\n`spark.interruptAll` interrupts all spark connect threads. So before this change, the listener long-running thread is also interrupted, therefore would be affected by it and stop sending back events. Now the long-running thread is closed, so it won't be affected.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSpark Connect improvement.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

PR fixes an issue in the vectorized parquet reader with respect to executing the `explode` function on nested arrays where the array cuts across two or more pages. It's probably possible to minimize this slightly more but I wasn't able to find a reproducer. It's also worth noting that this issue illustrates a current gap in the lower-level unit tests for the vectorized reader, which don't appear to test much related to output vector offsets.\r\n\r\nThe bug in question was a simple typo: the output row offset was used to dereference nested array lengths rather than input row offset. This only matters for the explode function and then only when resuming the same operation on a second page. This case (and all related cases) are, at present, untested. I added a high-level test and example `.parquet` file which reproduces the issue and verifies the fix, but it would be ideal if more tests were added at a lower level. It is very likely that other similar bugs are present within the vectorized reader as it relates to nested substructures remapped during the query pipeline.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt's a fairly straightforward typo issue in the code. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe vectorized parquet reader does not correctly handle this case\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nAside from fixing the vectorized reader? No.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test (well, more of an integration test) included in PR\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen using RocksDB state store provider to load a given checkpoint, if the RocksDB's loaded version != the checkpoint version, RocksDB will first load the latest snapshot that is prior to the checkpoint version. Right now without checking whether the RockDB is already loaded with the latest snapshot, RocksDB will always be closed and restarted. This PR proposes to first check the version before restart the DB.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn some case (though may be rare), RocksDB instance is already loaded with the latest snapshot version, so it does not have to be restarted. This PR can eliminate this unnecessary overhead.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPassing all existing test suites.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRenaming `UTF8_BINARY_LCASE` collation to `UTF8_LCASE`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs part of the collation effort in Spark, we've moved away from byte-by-byte logic towards character-by-character logic, so what we used to call `UTF8_BINARY_LCASE` is now more precisely `UTF8_LCASE`. For example, string searching in UTF8_LCASE now works on character-level (rather than on byte-level), which is reflected in this PRs: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46511, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46589, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46682, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46761, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46762. In addition, string comparison also works on character-level now, as per the changes introduced in this PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46700.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, what was previously named `UTF8_BINARY_LCASE` collation, will from now on be named `UTF8_LCASE`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-10T05:27:34Z","updated_at":"2024-06-11T17:26:36Z","closed_at":"2024-06-11T17:26:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"529409f0243c948513553c7498296bce766763da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR is created after discussion in this closed one: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46886\r\nI was trying to fix a bug (in connect, query.lastProgress doesn't have `numInputRows`, `inputRowsPerSecond`, and `processedRowsPerSecond`), and we reached the conclusion that what purposed in this PR should be the ultimate fix.\r\n\r\nIn python, for both classic spark and spark connect, the return type of `lastProgress` is `Dict` (and `recentProgress` is `List[Dict]`), but in scala it's the actual `StreamingQueryProgress` object:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/1a5d22aa2ffe769435be4aa6102ef961c55b9593/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/streaming/StreamingQuery.scala#L94-L101\r\n\r\nThis API discrepancy brings some confusion, like in Scala, users can do `query.lastProgress.batchId`, while in Python they have to do `query.lastProgress[\"batchId\"]`. \r\n\r\nThis PR makes `StreamingQuery.lastProgress` to return the actual `StreamingQueryProgress` (and `StreamingQuery.recentProgress` to return `List[StreamingQueryProgress]`). \r\n\r\nTo prevent breaking change, we extend `StreamingQueryProgress` to be a subclass of `dict`, so existing code accessing using dictionary method (e.g. `query.lastProgress[\"id\"]`) is still functional. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAPI parity\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now `StreamingQuery.lastProgress` returns the actual `StreamingQueryProgress` (and `StreamingQuery.recentProgress` returns `List[StreamingQueryProgress]`). \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Changed the `ineffectiveRules` variable of the `TreeNode` class to initialize lazily. This will reduce unnecessary driver memory pressure.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- Plans with large expression or operator trees are known to cause driver memory pressure; this is one step in alleviating that issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting UT covers behavior. Outwards facing behavior does not change. \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug that resulted in an internal error with some combination of the Python UDTF \"select\" and \"partitionBy\" options of the \"analyze\" method.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this logic in `Analyzer.scala` was wrong because it did not update the usage of `partitioningExpressionIndexes` to take the \"select\" expressions into account when they were introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45007:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval tvfWithTableColumnIndexes = tvf match {\r\n  case g @ Generate(pyudtf: PythonUDTF, _, _, _, _, _)\r\n      if tableArgs.head._1.partitioningExpressionIndexes.nonEmpty =>\r\n    //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\n    // The bug is here: the 'partitioningExpressionIndexes' are not valid\r\n    // if the UDTF \"select\" expressions are non-empty, since that prompts\r\n    // us to add a new projection (of a possibly different number of\r\n    // expressions) to evaluate them.\r\n    //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\n    val partitionColumnIndexes =\r\n      PythonUDTFPartitionColumnIndexes(tableArgs.head._1.partitioningExpressionIndexes)\r\n    g.copy(generator = pyudtf.copy(\r\n      pythonUDTFPartitionColumnIndexes = Some(partitionColumnIndexes)))\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR implements multiple performance optimizations related to `CurrentOrigin.withOrigin`.\r\n\r\n#### Avoiding `withOrigin` in cases where PartialFunctions are undefined\r\n\r\n`CurrentOrigin.withOrigin` can be expensive because it currently performs a ThreadLocal `get` and two ThreadLocal `set` calls on every call, plus the overhead of constructing the lambda to pass to `withOrigin` itself.\r\n\r\nMany parts of Catalyst have a pattern where a tree transformation method will contain code like\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval afterRule = CurrentOrigin.withOrigin {\r\n  rule.applyOrElse(this, identity[BaseType])\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `rule` is a PartialFunction. With this code, we must pay the cost of `withOrigin` even in cases where the `orElse` branch (which returns `identity[BaseType](this)` a.k.a. `this`) is hit because the PartialFunction does not apply (e.g. because we have a transformation which is only defined for `Alias` but is invoked over an entire expression tree).\r\n\r\nIf we instead rewrite this as\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval afterRule = if (rule.isDefinedAt(this)) {\r\n  CurrentOrigin.withOrigin(origin) {\r\n    rule.apply(this)\r\n  }\r\n} else {\r\n  this\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe can avoid the `withOrigin` overhead in cases where the rule / PartialFunction is not defined.\r\n\r\nI applied this style of optimization in `TreeNode`, `QueryPlan`, and `AnalysisHelper`.\r\n\r\n#### Apply similar skipping optimization in `ColumnResolutionHelper`:\r\n\r\nIn `ColumnResolutionHelper` there were two methods that did something like\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nCurrentOrigin.withOrigin(origin) {\r\n  if (earlyExitCondition) return e\r\n  // rest of code\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich I modified to\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nif (earlyExitCondition) {\r\n  e\r\n} else {\r\n  CurrentOrigin.withOrigin(origin) {\r\n    // rest of code\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nto avoid the `withOrigin` overhead in the early-exit case.\r\n\r\n#### Small optimization to `withOrigin` itself:\r\n\r\n`withOrigin` may often be setting a new origin that is exactly the same object as the current origin. We can detect this case with a cheap reference equality check and then skip a ThreadLocal set.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImproves Catalyst performance, both in production and in unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI believe that should be covered by existing unit tests.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, I observed a ~7-10% end-to-end runtime improvement on certain large test suites in our fork of Apache Spark.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd back python streaming data source connect test. Previously we remove this test because it fails in pure python spark connect library due to missing py4j. \r\nThis is because in python_streaming_source_runner, we import from pyspark.java_gateway instead of pyspark.utils, and pyspark.java_gateway requires py4j\r\n`from pyspark.java_gateway import local_connect_and_auth`\r\nThis was introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/c8c2492041782b9be7f10647191dcd0d5f6a5a8a accidentally.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAdd spark connect test for python streaming data source.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTest change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe can enable scalar subqueries that have `group by a` if there's a predicate `a = 1`, because these predicates guarantee the group-by produces at most one row. (This builds on top of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46839 and enables shapes there were unsupported prior to that PR as well.)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSupport valid subquery shapes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, support subquery shapes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-06-06T18:41:38Z","updated_at":"2024-06-17T06:28:30Z","closed_at":"2024-06-17T06:28:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3401e57feb229d2027c857ca9fbc3e19767928d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46902/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46902/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46902/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1312fa87e44aa51d8beab4b22430cf34354881a7","head":{"label":"jchen5:subq-gby-eq","ref":"subq-gby-eq","sha":"1312fa87e44aa51d8beab4b22430cf34354881a7","user":{"login":"jchen5","id":790409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDQwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/790409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5","html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":558995069,"node_id":"R_kgDOIVGWfQ","name":"spark","full_name":"jchen5/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jchen5","id":790409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDQwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/790409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5","html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-48555  \r\nFor pyspark, added the ability to use the \"Column\" type or names of column for the parameters of the following functions:\r\n\r\n- array_remove\r\n- array_position\r\n- map_contains_key\r\n- substring\r\n\r\nFor scala, added the ability to use \"Column\" type as the parameters of the `substring` function\r\n\r\nThis functionality already exists in the SQL syntax:\r\n```\r\nselect array_remove(col1, col2) from values (array(1,2,3), 2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nhowever, it isn't possible to do the same in python\r\n```python\r\ndf.select(F.array_remove(F.col(\"col1\"), F.col(\"col2\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that in scala the functions other than `substring` already accepted Column params (or rather, they accept `Any` and pass whatever the param is to `lit` so it ends up working), so I  only needed to change substring in the scala side. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo align the scala/python API with the SQL one.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, added new overloaded functions in scala and changed type hints/docstrings in python.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded doctests for the python changes, and tests in the scala test suites, then tested both manually and using the CI.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### Notes:\r\n\r\n- I opened the related JIRA ticket, but looks like I don't have the option to assign it myself, so if it is required and any reviewer does have permissions for it, I'd appreciate it\r\n- The \"Build\" workflow passed successfully, but the \"report tes results\" one didn't due to some authorization issue, I see that this is the same for many other open PRs right now so I assume its ok.\r\n- For the python changes, I tried to follow the convention used by other functions (such as `array_contains` or `when`), of using `value._jc if isinstance(value, Column) else value`\r\n- Im not really familiar with the `connect` functions, but seems like on the python side they already supported the use of columns so no extra changes were needed there\r\n- For the scala side, this is the first time I'm touching scala, I think I covered it all as I tried to match similar changes done in [a similar PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46045)\r\n- The same issue also exists for `substring_index` however I wasn't able to fix this one the same way I did for `substring`. Calling it with a `lit` for the `count` arg worked, but using a `col` error with a `NumberFormatError` for \"project_value_3\". I assume the error is related to trying to parse the Int [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/7cba1ab4d6acef4e9d73a8e6018b0902aac3a18d/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/stringExpressions.scala#L1449) . In that case I got lost in the scala code and decided to drop it, but if anyone knows how to fix this error I could change that function as well.\r\n\r\nThe contribution is my original work and I license the work to the project under the projectâ€™s open source license.\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-06T17:05:08Z","updated_at":"2024-06-17T03:43:48Z","closed_at":"2024-06-17T00:31:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c6742222f44577cab2c49285306207b4a5acb9b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46901/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46901/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46901/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6d08684cfe9b262d2239e9324c0606b1434bb6b7","head":{"label":"Ronserruya:support_columns_in_pyspark_functions","ref":"support_columns_in_pyspark_functions","sha":"6d08684cfe9b262d2239e9324c0606b1434bb6b7","user":{"login":"Ronserruya","id":21235163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjM1MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21235163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronserruya","html_url":"https://github.com/Ronserruya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronserruya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronserruya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronserruya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronserruya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronserruya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronserruya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronserruya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronserruya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronserruya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810818521,"node_id":"R_kgDOMFQb2Q","name":"spark","full_name":"Ronserruya/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ronserruya","id":21235163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjM1MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21235163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronserruya","html_url":"https://github.com/Ronserruya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronserruya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronserruya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronserruya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronserruya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronserruya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronserruya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronserruya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronserruya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ronserruya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ronserruya/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR improves perf for escapePathName with algorithms briefly described as:\r\n- If a path contains no special characters, we return the original identity instead of creating a new StringBuilder to append char by char\r\n- If a path contains special characters, we relocate the IDX of the first special character. Then initialize the StringBuilder with [0, IDX) of the original string, and do heximal padding if necessary starting from IDX.\r\n- An optimized char-to-hex function replaces the `String.format`\r\n\r\nAdd a fast path for storage paths or their parts that do not require escaping to avoid creating a StringBuilder to append per character.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nperformance improvement for hotspots\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n- new tests in ExternalCatalogUtilsSuite\r\n- Benchmark results (9x faster) \r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new SparkConf flag option, `spark.submit.callSystemExitOnMainExit` (default false), which when true will cause SparkSubmit to call `System.exit()` in the JVM once the user code's main method has exited (for Java / Scala jobs) or once the user's Python or R script has exited.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is intended to address a longstanding issue where `spark-submit` runs might hang after user code has completed:\r\n\r\n[According to Javaâ€™s java.lang.Runtime docs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Runtime.html#shutdown):\r\n\r\n> The Java Virtual Machine initiates the shutdown sequence in response to one of several events:\r\n>\r\n> 1. when the number of [live](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Thread.html#isAlive()) non-daemon threads drops to zero for the first time (see note below on the JNI Invocation API);\r\n> 2. when the Runtime.exit or System.exit method is called for the first time; or\r\n> 3. when some external event occurs, such as an interrupt or a signal is received from the operating system.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Python and R programs, SparkSubmitâ€™s PythonRunner and RRunner will call System.exit() if the user program exits with a non-zero exit code (see [python](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d5c33c6bfb5757b243fc8e1734daeaa4fe3b9b32/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/PythonRunner.scala#L101-L104) and [R](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d5c33c6bfb5757b243fc8e1734daeaa4fe3b9b32/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/RRunner.scala#L109-L111) runner code).\r\n\r\nBut for Java and Scala programs, plus any successful R or Python programs, Spark will not automatically call System.exit.\r\n\r\nIn those situation, the JVM will only shutdown when, via event (1), all non-[daemon](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2213340/what-is-a-daemon-thread-in-java) threads have exited (unless the job is cancelled and sent an external interrupt / kill signal, corresponding to event (3)).\r\n\r\nThus, non-daemon threads might cause logically-completed spark-submit jobs to hang rather than completing.\r\n\r\nThe non-daemon threads are not always under Spark's own control and may not necessarily be cleaned up by `SparkContext.stop()`.\r\n\r\nThus, it is useful to have an opt-in functionality to have SparkSubmit automatically call `System.exit()` upon main method exit (which usually, but not always, corresponds to job completion): this option will allow users and data platform operators to enforce System.exit() calls without having to modify individual jobs' code.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it adds a new user-facing configuration option for opting in to a behavior change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew tests in `SparkSubmitSuite`, including one which hangs (failing with a timeout) unless the new option is set to `true`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently in PySpark Client, calling `query.lastProgress` won't return you three fields: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0bc2c69d3646b77e5e5e038a9828a1937a419f26/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/streaming/progress.scala#L145-L152\r\n\r\nThis is because these three fields aren't native fields and is supposed to be reconstructed when rebuilding the client side `StreamingQueryProgress`. But this brings a bug only in Python Spark Connect.\r\n\r\nThis is not an issue for scala connect client, because the client side reconstruct the StreamingQueryProgress using the same way it's constructed in the server side.\r\n\r\nThe problem with python is the return type is a dict, so there is no such reconstruction, and therefor these fields are not there.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d6fcba0d4ae73bc65022355b7c8da90ccae68213/python/pyspark/sql/connect/streaming/query.py#L122\r\n\r\nThis is not an issue in classic pyspark also, because classic pyspark calls the `jsonValue` of `StreamingQueryProgress`, which has all fields defined:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0bc2c69d3646b77e5e5e038a9828a1937a419f26/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/streaming/progress.scala#L162-L178\r\n\r\nIn this PR we send all such fields to the client to fix this issue. This won't cause backward compatibility issue because that field is a map anyways.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBug fix\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test, passed locally.

If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently in PySpark Client, calling `query.lastProgress` won't return you three fields: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0bc2c69d3646b77e5e5e038a9828a1937a419f26/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/streaming/progress.scala#L145-L152\r\n\r\nThis is because these three fields aren't native fields and are supposed to be reconstructed when rebuilding the client side `StreamingQueryProgress`. But this brings a bug only in Python Spark Connect.\r\n\r\nThis is not an issue for scala connect client, because the client side reconstruct the StreamingQueryProgress using the same way it's constructed in the server side.\r\n\r\nThe problem with python is the return type is a dict, so there is no such reconstruction, and therefore these fields are not there.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d6fcba0d4ae73bc65022355b7c8da90ccae68213/python/pyspark/sql/connect/streaming/query.py#L122\r\n\r\nThis is not an issue in classic pyspark also, because classic pyspark calls the `jsonValue` of `StreamingQueryProgress`, which has all fields defined:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0bc2c69d3646b77e5e5e038a9828a1937a419f26/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/streaming/progress.scala#L162-L178\r\n\r\nIn this PR we send all such fields to the client to fix this issue. This won't cause backward compatibility issue because that field is a map anyways.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBug fix\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test, passed locally.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to  improve SQL function `sentences`, includes:\r\n- update the description of the `sentences` expression to make it more realistic.\r\n- add `def sentences(string: Column, language: Column): Column` to SQL functions\r\n- `codegen` support for `sentences`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix inconsistency in using the function `sentences` in the following scenarios\r\n  <img width=\"1051\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/033c731d-5a2f-455f-8517-ed95bd6c1f6e\">\r\n  \r\n- According to the definition of function `sentences`, we should only allow the following two kinds of parameter calls:\r\n  A.sentences(str)\r\n  B.sentences(str, language, country) - the parameters `language` and `country` either coexist or do not exist at the same time\r\n\r\n  **In file `sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/functions.scala`, only the following two functions are defined**:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/f4434c36cc4f7b0147e0e8fe26ac0f177a5199cd/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/functions.scala#L4273-L4282\r\n\r\n- When we directly call the expression `sentences`, it actually supports the following:\r\nA.`df.select(sentences($\"str\", $\"language\", $\"country\"))`;\r\nB.`df.select(sentences($\"str\", $\"language\"))`;\r\nC.`df.select(sentences($\"str\"))`;\r\n\r\n## Let's align it\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, allow calling SQL function `sentences` as parameters (`str`, `language`).\r\nThe `sentences` function, when `language` parameter is not null and `country` parameter is null, we no longer use `Locale US`, instead use `Locale(language)`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Add new UT & Update existed UT.\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n- Manually check\r\n```scala\r\nscala> val df =  Seq((\"Hi there! The price was $1,234.56.... But, not now.\", \"en\", \"US\")).toDF(\"str\", \"language\", \"country\");\r\nval df: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [str: string, language: string ... 1 more field]\r\n\r\nscala> df.select(sentences($\"str\", $\"language\", $\"country\"));\r\nval res0: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [sentences(str, language, country): array<array<string>>]\r\n\r\nscala> df.select(sentences($\"str\", $\"language\"));\r\nval res1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [sentences(str, language, ): array<array<string>>]\r\n\r\nscala> df.select(sentences($\"str\"));\r\nval res2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [sentences(str, , ): array<array<string>>]\r\n\r\nscala> df.selectExpr(\"sentences(str, language, country)\");\r\nval res3: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [sentences(str, language, country): array<array<string>>]\r\n\r\nscala> df.selectExpr(\"sentences(str, language)\");\r\nval res4: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [sentences(str, language, ): array<array<string>>]\r\n\r\nscala> df.selectExpr(\"sentences(str)\");\r\nval res5: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [sentences(str, , ): array<array<string>>]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-06-05T12:06:57Z","updated_at":"2024-09-13T03:17:32Z","closed_at":"2024-09-11T18:58:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bf77339e323c67d26f1cc5ab604ed89937e230b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46880/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46880/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46880/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e389e1863c2fed24fcd335dced4512b6ba2d7a07","head":{"label":"panbingkun:sentences_improve","ref":"sentences_improve","sha":"e389e1863c2fed24fcd335dced4512b6ba2d7a07","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to support `Hive UDAF` inherited from `GenericUDAFResolver` or `GenericUDAFResolver2`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Currently, we only support `Hive UDAF` inherited from `AbstractGenericUDAFResolver` and `UDAF`\r\n  A.**AbstractGenericUDAFResolver**\r\n  https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/release-2.0.0/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/udf/generic/AbstractGenericUDAFResolver.java\r\n  <img width=\"1074\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/dfaaffde-c365-4611-9f24-9ed91d715513\">\r\n\r\n  B.**UDAF**\r\n  https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/release-2.0.0/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/exec/UDAF.java\r\n  <img width=\"950\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/a0e0ccdd-8176-44bc-9953-0c69eed502f0\">\r\n\r\n- However, there are some `Hive UDAFs` in production that are not directly inherited from `AbstractGenericUDAFResolver`, such as\r\n  A.GenericUDAFCount (implements `GenericUDAFResolver2`)\r\n  https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/release-2.0.0/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/udf/generic/GenericUDAFCount.java\r\n  <img width=\"945\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/2c3ad75b-dcc3-405b-a56b-344d70ada7af\">\r\n \r\n  B.GenericUDAFnGrams (implements `GenericUDAFResolver`)\r\n  https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/release-2.0.0/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/udf/generic/GenericUDAFnGrams.java\r\n  <img width=\"908\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/fb15ebad-0995-4dd7-9c97-5766674be2fa\">\r\n\r\n**These UDAFs cannot be used in Spark**, We need to support these.\r\n\r\n- The class inheritance system of `GenericUDAFResolver` and `GenericUDAFResolver2` are as follows:\r\n  A.`GenericUDAFResolver`\r\n  https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/release-2.0.1/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/udf/generic/GenericUDAFResolver.java\r\n  <img width=\"916\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/32bf12d7-8f66-4083-9f0c-76f9e70ba58e\">\r\n\r\n  B.`GenericUDAFResolver2`\r\n  https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/release-2.0.0/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/udf/generic/GenericUDAFResolver2.java\r\n  <img width=\"913\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/1ddfb171-9d2b-4bff-bb8f-3f04986428a0\">\r\n\r\n**Summary, their inheritance system and support status are as follows**:\r\n```\r\nGenericUDAFResolver (After this PR, can support)\r\n  GenericUDAFResolver2 (After this PR, can support)\r\n     AbstractGenericUDAFResolver (Before this PR, only support was provided)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, we can support `Hive UDAF` inherited from `GenericUDAFResolver` or `GenericUDAFResolver2`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Add new UT\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-05T08:28:36Z","updated_at":"2024-09-15T00:25:51Z","closed_at":"2024-09-15T00:25:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"855810afb43fe20144d4e5059c394df23b442c74","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46878/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46878/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46878/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a95b6e1e0aa0a14c6f77b90027609e39381fed24","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-48537","ref":"SPARK-48537","sha":"a95b6e1e0aa0a14c6f77b90027609e39381fed24","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45710 . Some custom `FileSystem` implementations read the `hadoop.fs.s3a.connection.establish.timeout` config as numeric, and do not support the `30s` syntax. To make it safe, this PR proposes to set this conf to `30000` instead of `30s`. I checked the doc page and this config is milliseconds.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

is rework of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44954\r\n\r\nWhat changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd support for custom partition location assignment for Kafka sources in Structured Streaming.\r\n\r\nWhy are the changes needed?\r\n[Please see the design doc for greater detail and further discussion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RoEk_mt8AUh9sTQZ1NfzIuuYKf1zx6BP1K3IlJ2b8iM/edit#heading=h.pbt6pdb2jt5c)\r\n\r\n[SPARK-15406](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15406) Added Kafka consumer support to Spark Structured Streaming, but it did not add custom partition location assignment as a feature. The Structured Streaming Kafka consumer as it exists today evenly allocates Kafka topic partitions to executors without regard to Kafka broker rack information or executor location. This behavior can drive large cross-AZ networking costs in large deployments.\r\n\r\n[The design doc for SPARK-15406](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19t2rWe51x7tq2e5AOfrsM9qb8_m7BRuv9fel9i0PqR8/edit#heading=h.k36c6oyz89xw) described the ability to assign Kafka partitions to particular executors (a feature which would enable rack awareness), but it seems that feature was never implemented.\r\n\r\nFor DStreams users, there does seem to be a way to assign Kafka partitions to Spark executors in a custom fashion with [LocationStrategies.PreferFixed](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/connector/kafka-0-10/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/streaming/kafka010/LocationStrategy.scala#L69), so this sort of functionality has a precedent.\r\n\r\nDoes this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nAn additional parameter will be accepted on the Kafka source provider. This parameter is provisionally named partitionlocationassigner. The parameter takes a class name, which when instantiated gives the Kafka source with user-provided Kafka partition location suggestions. The class should implement a new trait defined in this PR and described in the [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RoEk_mt8AUh9sTQZ1NfzIuuYKf1zx6BP1K3IlJ2b8iM/edit#heading=h.pbt6pdb2jt5c).\r\n\r\nHow was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\nWas this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-06-04T12:31:41Z","updated_at":"2025-01-28T00:24:17Z","closed_at":"2025-01-28T00:24:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to \r\n- add `grpc_max_message_size` description to `client-connection-string.md`\r\n- rename `hostname` to `host`.\r\n- fix some typo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- In PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45842, we extract a `constant` as a `parameter` for the connect client, and we need to update the related doc.\r\n- Make the parameter names in our doc consistent with those in the code,\r\n  In the doc, it is called `hostname`, but in the code, it is called `host`\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d273fdf37bc291aadf8677305bda2a91b593219f/connector/connect/common/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connect/client/SparkConnectClientParser.scala#L36\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, only for doc `client-connection-string.md`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-04T11:18:33Z","updated_at":"2024-06-04T23:55:08Z","closed_at":"2024-06-04T23:55:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7331855ce267fd5469503290f73215db3a84a0aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46862/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46862/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46862/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/06418d096b9360f363014bd3ba1acdaf08ebf583","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-48523","ref":"SPARK-48523","sha":"06418d096b9360f363014bd3ba1acdaf08ebf583","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTurn on Arrow optimization for Python UDFs by default.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nArrow-optimized Python UDFs are introduced in Spark 3.5, with major advantages over the current default, pickled Python UDFs:\r\n\r\n**Faster (De)serialization**\r\nApache Arrow is a columnar in-memory data format that provides efficient data interchange between different systems and programming languages. Unlike Pickle, which serializes an entire Row as an object, Arrow stores data in a column-oriented format, allowing for better compression and memory locality, which is more suitable for analytical workloads.\r\nThe chart below shows the performance of an Arrow-optimized Python UDF performing a single transformation with a different-sized input dataset. The cluster consists of 3 workers and 1 driver, and each machine in the cluster has 16 vCPUs and 122 GiBs memory. The Arrow-optimized Python UDF is **~1.6 times** faster than the pickled Python UDF.\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/47337188/b585313d-54cd-49b9-8f54-a2581b1bc909)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Standardized Type Coercion**\r\nUDF type coercion poses challenges when the Python values returned by the UDF do not align with the user-specified return type. Unfortunately, the default, pickled Python UDF's type coercion has certain limitations, such as relying on None as a fallback for type mismatches, leading to potential ambiguity and data loss. Additionally, converting date, datetime, and tuples to strings can yield ambiguous results. Arrow-optimized Python UDFs address these issues by leveraging Arrow's well-defined set of rules for type coercion.  An example is as shown below:\r\n```py\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([datetime.date(1970, 1, 1), datetime.date(1970, 1, 2)], schema='date')\r\n>>> df.select(udf(lambda x: x, 'string', useArrow=True)('value').alias('date_in_string')).show()\r\n+--------------+\r\n|date_in_string|\r\n+--------------+\r\n|    1970-01-01|\r\n|    1970-01-02|\r\n+--------------+\r\n>>> df.select(udf(lambda x: x, 'string', useArrow=False)('value').alias('date_in_string')).show()\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|date_in_string                                                         |\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|java.util.GregorianCalendar[time=?,areFieldsSet=false,areAllFieldsSet..|\r\n|java.util.GregorianCalendar[time=?,areFieldsSet=false,areAllFieldsSet..|\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo for most cases, Arrow optimization for Python UDFs is turned on by default, and results will be identical. However, there are some corner cases when the type coercion rule differs between Arrow and Pickle, which will be addressed in a follow-up PR to instruct users on a smooth migration. \r\n\r\nSee [here](https://www.databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/notebooks/python-udf-type-coercion.html) for a comprehensive comparison between Pickled Python UDFs and Arrow-optimized Python UDFs regarding type coercion.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-03T23:16:20Z","updated_at":"2024-06-04T00:33:33Z","closed_at":"2024-06-04T00:33:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0e3df9409d6af9d7d281098ede8283f0b5b6953b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46857/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46857/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46857/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/84683f182e35e87c39c968a52a26cf176fc755f8","head":{"label":"xinrong-meng:enableArrow","ref":"enableArrow","sha":"84683f182e35e87c39c968a52a26cf176fc755f8","user":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335786381,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3ODYzODE=","name":"spark","full_name":"xinrong-meng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng/spark","description":"Apache
