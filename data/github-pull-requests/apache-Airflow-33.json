checks were put into place early in 2.x to add stricter constraints in the database. They are executed before the migrations when the user runs 'airflow upgradedb' to make sure there are no data integrity issues that would fail the migration halfway, which is both difficult to debug and recover from.\r\n\r\nThe checks always pass if the user is on a more recent Airflow 2 version, on which the constraints are now enforced by the database. Since we have removed all migration files prior to 2.10, the user must upgrade to at least 2.10 first (which has the checks) before upgrading to 3.0 anyway, so we can safely remove the checks going forward.\r\n\r\n(Additional context: these checks need to be modified if we are to rename `execution_date` on DagRun, which I’m doing in #41818. Instead of needing to work on the change, I think we should remove those checks since they don’t ever need to be run anyway.)","created_at":"2024-08-29T05:55:40Z","updated_at":"2024-08-29T09:20:43Z","closed_at":"2024-08-29T09:20:41Z","merged_at":"2024-08-29T09:20:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"56a3987c3fca3a574b8f1c7faa8f08de2becee60","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/41850/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/41850/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/41850/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/381f54a2e7eb09e66122ada3ffe15402b9d4cf1a","head":{"label":"astronomer:remove-db-upgrade-checks","ref":"remove-db-upgrade-checks","sha":"381f54a2e7eb09e66122ada3ffe15402b9d4cf1a","user":{"login":"astronomer","id":12449437,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNDQ5NDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12449437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer","html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65323404,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTMyMzQwNA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"astronomer/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"astronomer","id":12449437,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNDQ5NDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12449437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer","html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer/airflow","description":"Apache

#41838\r\n\r\nAdd optional `return_immediately` parameter to PubSubPullSensor (default: `True` for backwards compatibility). This allows setting `return_immediately=False` to resolve issue #41838 and improve performance. The parameter was originally removed from the class but hard-coded to True in the PubSubHook.pull call in the poke function in PR #23231. \r\n\r\nNote: SubscriberClient.pull (called by PubSubHook.pull) warns that setting return_immediately=True is discouraged due to performance impact.\r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn_immediately (bool):\r\n    Optional. If this field set to true, the system will\r\n    respond immediately even if it there are no messages\r\n    available to return in the ``Pull`` response. Otherwise,\r\n    the system may wait (for a bounded amount of time) until\r\n    at least one message is available, rather than returning\r\n    no messages. Warning: setting this field to ``true`` is\r\n    discouraged because it adversely impacts the performance\r\n    of ``Pull`` operations. We recommend that users do not\r\n    set this field.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

#33619 \r\n\r\nAirflow currently only supports reading remote log from elasticsearch. This PR adds feature to also allow reading remote logs from opensearch.\r\n\r\nSimilar to reading remote logs from elasticsearch, users need to use other tools to import logs into Opensearch. \r\n\r\nThe set up is very similar to setting up remote logging for Elasticsearch. In the airflow.cfg: \r\n\r\n```\r\nremote_logging = True\r\nremote_log_conn_id = opensearch_default\r\n\r\n[opensearch]\r\nhost = [OS host name] (e.g. my-opensearch-01)\r\nport = [port number] (e.g. 9200)\r\nusername = \r\npassword = \r\n```\r\n\r\nDepending on your Opensearch config, you may also add the following in airflow.cfg :\r\n\r\n```\r\n[opensearch_configs]\r\nhttp_compress = False\r\nuse_ssl = False\r\nverify_certs = False\r\nssl_assert_hostname = False\r\nssl_show_warn = False\r\nca_certs = \r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you set up everything successfully (And correctly ship your logs to Opensearch), webserver should output logs like the following: \r\n\r\n```\r\n[2024-08-27T15:02:54.611+0000] {base.py:258} INFO - POST http://my-opensearch-01:9200/_all/_count [status:200

is the initial PR for AIP-84, setting up a very basic separate FastAPI API for UI purposes. I wanted to take that incrementally instead of opening a big PR latter. Some steps will require discussions on the implementation (I see different ways of handling things), and I don't want a gigantic PR getting blocked for days/weeks.\r\n\r\nThe goal at the end of that is to have 1 `object` custom endpoint duplicated to the new `UI REST API` showing how such endpoint are developed and tested as part of the new API.\r\n\r\nAt the time of airflow 3 release, old endpoint `/object` will simply be deleted, so we do not care at that time about duplication. (old endpoint contribution will be limited / filtered anyway).\r\n\r\nTo test this very basic endpoint you can for now simply run airflow with breeze. Stop the webserver and start the new UI Rest API manually with `fastapi dev airflow/api_ui/main.py`. Then in another breeze terminal run `curl localhost:8000/ui/next_run_datasets/<your_dag_id_with_datasets>` \r\n\r\nFollow up PRs in the next few days to:\r\n- Integrate the new UI API to the CLI (most likely under a new command `airflow ui-api` or directly under `airflow webserver` ?)\r\n- Integrate the new UI API to Breeze (for developer experience)\r\n- Tests + CI integration (new test type, CI jobs etc.)\r\n- Add permissions and access control\r\n- Contributor documentation for this new API\r\n- dev tools to automatically generate front-end code (typescript types + react queries) based on

Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n### Apache Airflow version\r\n\r\n2.8.4 in my environment, but the issue is still present in main\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\n\r\nA client submitted an S3 file to my workflow with an octothorpe in the filename, essentially `s3://my-bucket/path/to/key/email campaign - PO# 123456_REPORT.csv`. When my Airflow DAG tried to parse this URL, part of the filename was lost:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> s3_key = 's3://my-bucket/path/to/key/email campaign - PO# 123456_REPORT.csv'\r\n>>> S3Hook.parse_s3_url(s3_key)\r\n('my-bucket', 'path/to/key/email campaign - PO')\r\n```\r\n ### What you think should happen instead\r\n\r\nThe key should not be truncated. The result of the above example should be `('my-bucket', 'path/to/key/email campaign - PO# 123456_REPORT.csv')`\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce:\r\n\r\nCall `S3Hook.parse_s3_url()` with a `#` character in the S3 URL. Everything after the `#` is lost, because urllib.parse.urlsplit() is current called with the default option `allow_fragments=True`.\r\n\r\nThis PR passes `allow_fragments=False` to `urlsplit` to prevent this error. As far as I can tell, there are no valid cases of `#` in an S3 key being treated as a fragment, and no existing GitHub issue to fix this.\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\nUbuntu 22.04\r\n\r\n###

id pattern matches characters until first `\"` or `\\n` is encountered, which is fine for a following case:\r\n- logged line: `[2024-08-27 11:20:22,094] INFO  Submitted job: 2024-08-27_04_20_21-7947372725816706151`\r\n- extracted job id: `2024-08-27_04_20_21-7947372725816706151`\r\n\r\nHowever, if the logger is configured differently, for example, has a whitespace and a suffix at the end with additional information, the pattern extracts the id together with the suffix:\r\n- logged line: `[2024-08-27 11:20:22,094] INFO  Submitted job: 2024-08-27_04_20_21-7947372725816706151 (org.apache.beam.runners.dataflow.DataflowRunner) (main)`\r\n- extracted job id: `2024-08-27_04_20_21-7947372725816706151 (org.apache.beam.runners.dataflow.DataflowRunner) (main)` \r\n\r\nIn the previous example suffix `(org.apache.beam.runners.dataflow.DataflowRunner) (main)` should not be extracted as part of the job id.\r\n\r\nI updated the pattern by adding the whitespace character `\\s` (along side existing `\"` and `\\n`), indicating the end of job id.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

was running `pre-commit run -a` to fix some conflicts on database migration and found some interesting pre-commit failures that only occur in edge cases. Nothing serious, let’s just fix them. I don’t think any of these are common enough to require new checks.\r\n\r\nThe '.venv' name (common for in-project virtual environments) is not included in rat-excludes, causing a lint failure since a license is not found in it. Since 'venv' (no leading dot) is excluded, let's also add '.venv' to the file.\r\n\r\nThe 'downgradedb' method of BaseDBManager is declared abstract, but not implemented in FABDBManager. This causes Mypy to error when FABDBManager is instantiated. We don't always need the implement the method, so let's remove the abstractmethod decorator.\r\n\r\nFinally (and least critically), when you run pre-commit during a merge, a hook checks if you're committing unresolved conflicts. The check is not particularly smart, however, and can mis-identify header underlines in restructuredText as false positives. This is easy to fix; just add one more character to the underline. It's fine as long as the underline is not EXACTLY SEVEN characters.","created_at":"2024-08-26T10:55:17Z","updated_at":"2024-08-28T06:58:12Z","closed_at":"2024-08-27T13:13:32Z","merged_at":"2024-08-27T13:13:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"82abd7991353ca4fb611129f76ba3f6095d7deb1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1769003317,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5MDAzMzE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:dev-tools","name":"area:dev-tools","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1780460538,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzgwNDYwNTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:plugins","name":"area:plugins","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1915320862,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTE1MzIwODYy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:secrets","name":"area:secrets","color":"d31d93","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1993586993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTkzNTg2OTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/kind:documentation","name":"kind:documentation","color":"1ED98E","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2017921084,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE3OTIxMDg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:production-image","name":"area:production-image","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"Production

when running Airflow (locally but probably also when deployed) a lot of warnings are emitted by Plugins Manager like:\r\n```\r\n/opt/airflow/airflow/plugins_manager.py:30 DeprecationWarning: 'cgitb' is deprecated and slated for removal in Python 3.13\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is caused by a import in plugins_manager.py - and surprisingly besides this import all other types of the specified list actually use `HookLineageReader` - unable to trace this down, this PR removes the import and traces. Less noise in logs.\r\n\r\nAs this also will bother all users in Airfow 2.10, I propose to fix this also in the 2.10

Also docs are pointing to this.\r\n\r\nAs it is a MVP, it can be started to be experienced and functions are limited to the bare minimum. But as something that is working, further functions can be added. Status of implementation is tracked in `docs/apache-airflow-providers-edge/edge_executor.rst` where also limitations are listed.\r\n\r\nAs this is a split for the provider-only files as PR from the overall PR #40900, there are two PRs completing the set which are tracked separately:\r\n- PR for changes in Core, independent of the provider package: #41730\r\n- PR for development convenience in Breeze: #41731\r\n\r\nIf you want to have something \"testable\" being running, please use descriptions and code from PR #40900\r\n\r\nFYI @clellmann @wolfdn @AutomationDev85
