you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImplement Aggregating Async State API for ForStStateBackend\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Deser/ser for Aggregating state*\r\n  - *Build put/get request*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n`ForStStateExecutorTest` and `InternalAggregatingStateTest` for testing get and put operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature

What is the purpose of the change\r\nAfter [FLINK-19463](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-19463), the checkpoint storage has been split from the state backends. The deprecated implementation MemoryStateBackend and RocksDBStateBackend are replaced by HashMapStateBackend and EmbeddedRocksDBStateBackend. Those two state backends should be removed in Flink 2.0.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - *Remove MemoryStateBackend, FsStateBackend, RocksDBStateBackend. And change related test.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRemove all class dependencies from `flink-java` in table modules.\r\n\r\nNote: I have ensured that all table modules does not depend on the `flink-java` module during compilation. However, since most tests depend on `flink-streaming-java`, which in turn depends on `flink-java`, the dependency on `flink-java` will not be excluded to ensure that these cases do not fail, until `flink-streaming-java` removes its dependency on `flink-java`.\r\n\r\nAll commits except the last one (add back `flink-java`) have been verified by `mvn dependency:tree -Dincludes=org.apache.flink:flink-java` under `flink-table` module.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Remove legacy csv supported by flink-table*\r\n  - *Remove all class dependencies from

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe dataset APIs have been deprecated, and we need to remove the `flink-java` dependency from the modules.\r\n\r\nRegarding removing the `flink-java` dependency, the PR for the table module can be found here: https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/25420. This PR is for the remaining modules.\r\n\r\nThe PR to delete the `flink-java` module is: https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/25435\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- delete `flink-optimizer` and `flink-example-batch` module\r\n- remove modules (exclude table) dependency on `flink-java`\r\n- delete test cases which only used to test dataset api\r\n- modify some test cases using dataset APIs to use datastream APIs\r\n- move some class from `flink-java` module to `flink-core` or `flink-runtime` module\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: yes\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n##

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRemove all class dependencies from `flink-java` in table modules.\r\n\r\nNote: I have ensured that all table modules does not depend on the `flink-java` module during compilation. However, since most tests depend on `flink-streaming-java`, which in turn depends on `flink-java`, the dependency on `flink-java` will not be excluded to ensure that these cases do not fail, until `flink-streaming-java` removes its dependency on `flink-java`.\r\n\r\nAll commits except the last one (add back `flink-java`) have been verified by `mvn dependency:tree -Dincludes=org.apache.flink:flink-java` under `flink-table` module.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Remove legacy csv supported by flink-table*\r\n  - *Remove all class dependencies from `flink-java` in table modules*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following

The AdaptiveGraphGenerator interface is responsible for:\r\n\r\n1. Generating the JobGraph\r\n2. Responding to upstream job vertex finished events, generating JobVertex, and updating it to the JobGraph\r\n3. Providing StreamGraphContext to allow StreamGraphOptimizer to add, delete, and modify StreamNode and StreamEdge\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Implement the AdaptiveGraphGenerator interface\r\n- Implement the StreamGraphContext interface\r\n- Some UT cases\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n[FLINK-36389](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-36389)\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where the `DelegationTokenReceiverRepository` does not check the `DELEGATION_TOKENS_ENABLED` flag before initializing delegation token receivers, leading to the following error in nearline Flink jobs:\r\n\r\n> `java.lang.IllegalStateException: Delegation token receiver with service name {} has multiple implementations [hadoopfs]\r\n`\r\n## Brief change log\r\nWhen the `DELEGATION_TOKENS_ENABLED` config is disabled, receiver is not expected to load external services.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded unit test to verify if the `DELEGATION_TOKENS_ENABLED` config is set to false, none of the services got loaded by the receiver.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-27T00:40:31Z","updated_at":"2024-09-30T00:08:56Z","closed_at":"2024-09-29T22:04:29Z","merged_at":"2024-09-29T22:04:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"18e195004ad816a77f3604fab4dfff00c6381ed3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272992926,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkyOTI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/YARN","name":"component=Deployment/YARN","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278776326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4Nzc2MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/Kubernetes","name":"component=Deployment/Kubernetes","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25412/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25412/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25412/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/07cdecd3d791642872c12b7bd8acfdccfb8a7954","head":{"label":"argoyal2212:FLINK-36389","ref":"FLINK-36389","sha":"07cdecd3d791642872c12b7bd8acfdccfb8a7954","user":{"login":"argoyal2212","id":183032381,"node_id":"U_kgDOCujaPQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183032381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/argoyal2212","html_url":"https://github.com/argoyal2212","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/argoyal2212/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/argoyal2212/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/argoyal2212/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/argoyal2212/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/argoyal2212/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/argoyal2212/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/argoyal2212/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/argoyal2212/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/argoyal2212/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":863801656,"node_id":"R_kgDOM3yROA","name":"flink","full_name":"argoyal2212/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"argoyal2212","id":183032381,"node_id":"U_kgDOCujaPQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183032381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/argoyal2212","html_url":"https://github.com/argoyal2212","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/argoyal2212/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/argoyal2212/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/argoyal2212/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/argoyal2212/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/argoyal2212/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/argoyal2212/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/argoyal2212/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/argoyal2212/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/argoyal2212/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/argoyal2212/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request makes flink-runtime-web project detect the base href dynamically so that it can work with paths like http://foo.bar/my-flink-dashboard\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Dynamically insert the `<base href=\"\" />` tag based on the current path instead of hard coded `<base href=\"/\" />`\r\n  - Added provider for `APP_BASE_HREF` which points to `window.location.pathname`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nplz cf jira\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- added support for standard way to enable/disable auto-registering schema in the registry\r\n- default to auto-registering (current behavior)\r\n- allow both datastream  /  table API\r\n- confirmed the datastream API works fine on our pipeline\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-26T15:00:40Z","updated_at":"2025-01-15T20:13:02Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aed9238fc75992972ba8758c5ac08570cf212094","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1274303759,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc0MzAzNzU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Formats","name":"component=Formats","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25410/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25410/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25410/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/1be9cea5732424663a93c2099af20621e92ca19c","head":{"label":"leboncoin:FLINK-33045_support-auto-register-schema","ref":"FLINK-33045_support-auto-register-schema","sha":"1be9cea5732424663a93c2099af20621e92ca19c","user":{"login":"leboncoin","id":12626280,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNjI2Mjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12626280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leboncoin","html_url":"https://github.com/leboncoin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leboncoin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leboncoin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leboncoin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leboncoin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leboncoin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leboncoin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leboncoin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leboncoin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leboncoin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":863395686,"node_id":"R_kgDOM3ZfZg","name":"flink","full_name":"leboncoin/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"leboncoin","id":12626280,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNjI2Mjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12626280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leboncoin","html_url":"https://github.com/leboncoin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leboncoin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leboncoin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leboncoin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leboncoin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leboncoin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leboncoin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leboncoin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leboncoin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leboncoin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/leboncoin/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR supports dispatch state requests in task thread.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add `state.backend.forst.executor.inline-coordinator` to allow dispatching state requests in task thread.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests `ForStStateExecutorTest`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-26T12:20:11Z","updated_at":"2024-09-29T03:20:14Z","closed_at":"2024-09-29T03:20:14Z","merged_at":"2024-09-29T03:20:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"73a02855caf73103fbc882d51ea413be149d8a3f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25408/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25408/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25408/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/665fd155660a3e8ddc52a687f86d562bd71afff8","head":{"label":"fredia:inlinecoor","ref":"inlinecoor","sha":"665fd155660a3e8ddc52a687f86d562bd71afff8","user":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":375962860,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzU5NjI4NjA=","name":"flink","full_name":"fredia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fredia/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen a sink contains a shuffle between writer and committer, a committer may receive committables coming from multiple subtasks. So far, we immediately merged then on receival. However, that makes it later impossible to trace whether we received all messages from an upstream task.\r\n\r\nIt also made rescaling of the committer awkward: during normal processing all committables of a committer have the same subtaskId as the committer. On downscale, these subtaskIds suddenly don't match and need to be replaced, which we solved by merging the SubtaskCommittableManagers.\r\n\r\nThis commit decouples the collection of committables from changing the subtaskId for emission. Committables retain the upstream subtask id in the CommittableCollection, which survives serialization and deserialization. Only upon emission, we substitute the subtask id with the one of the emitting committer.\r\n\r\nThis is, in particular, useful for a global committer, where all subtasks are collected. As a side fix, the new serialization also contains the numberOfSubtasks such that different checkpoints may have different degree of parallelism.\r\n\r\nThe old approach probably has edge cases where scaling a UC would result in stalled pipelines because certain metadata doesn't match. This would not affect pipelines which  chain Writer/Committer (no channel state), Writer and Committer have same DOP (results in a Forward channel, which doesn't use UC for exactly these reasons), and a non-keyed shuffles (because they don't provide any guarantees). Since a keyed shuffle must use the subtask id of the committables, the new approach should be safe. However, since we disabled UC entirely for sinks to adhere to the contract of notifyCheckpointComplete, this shouldn't matter going forward. It's still important to consider these cases though for restoring from Flink 1 checkpoints.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Do not prematurely merge CommittableManager \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nCovered by the following existing test suites that I partially adjusted\r\n* flink-runtime/src/test/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/runtime/operators/sink/committables\r\n* flink-runtime/src/test/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/api/connector/sink2\r\n* flink-streaming-java/src/test/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/runtime/operators/sink\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR allows you to use CTAS to reorder the columns defined in the `SELECT` part by specifying all column names without data types in the `CREATE` part. This feature is equivalent to the `INSERT INTO` statement.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE my_ctas_table (\r\n    order_time, price, quantity, id\r\n) WITH (\r\n    'connector' = 'kafka',\r\n    ...\r\n) AS SELECT id, price, quantity, order_time FROM source_table;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resulting table `my_ctas_table` will be equivalent to create the following table and insert the data with the following statement:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE my_ctas_table (\r\n    order_time TIMESTAMP(3),\r\n    price DOUBLE,\r\n    quantity DOUBLE,\r\n    id BIGINT\r\n) WITH (\r\n    'connector' = 'kafka',\r\n    ...\r\n);\r\n\r\nINSERT INTO my_ctas_table (order_time, price, quantity, id)\r\n    SELECT id, price, quantity, order_time FROM source_table;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- Added unit tests and integration tests to verify the feature\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? Updated the `create.md` documentation\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-25T22:02:41Z","updated_at":"2024-10-03T07:38:32Z","closed_at":"2024-10-03T07:38:32Z","merged_at":"2024-10-03T07:38:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"baa67f465b77c9b3131d8153b52d2a94e3e00ef9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25401/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25401/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25401/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/ce71701bcfcf090ec9a365fdd10e24c94a7295e8","head":{"label":"spena:flink-35709","ref":"flink-35709","sha":"ce71701bcfcf090ec9a365fdd10e24c94a7295e8","user":{"login":"spena","id":5048242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDgyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5048242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spena","html_url":"https://github.com/spena","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spena/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spena/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spena/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spena/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spena/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spena/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spena/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spena/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spena/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":820692752,"node_id":"R_kgDOMOrHEA","name":"flink","full_name":"spena/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"spena","id":5048242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDgyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5048242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spena","html_url":"https://github.com/spena","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spena/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spena/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spena/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spena/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spena/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spena/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spena/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spena/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spena/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/spena/flink","description":"Apache

Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-25T12:09:55Z","updated_at":"2024-09-27T03:03:02Z","closed_at":"2024-09-27T03:03:02Z","merged_at":"2024-09-27T03:03:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"fc3ace9bd652a8035c3a3d5a1b2cd580f4566a57","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273030665,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDMwNjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/Python","name":"component=API/Python","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25398/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25398/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25398/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9616da959643d0b9635ee710613f9e7af3a54dc3","head":{"label":"dianfu:remove_deprecation_pyflink","ref":"remove_deprecation_pyflink","sha":"9616da959643d0b9635ee710613f9e7af3a54dc3","user":{"login":"dianfu","id":5466492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjY0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5466492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu","html_url":"https://github.com/dianfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":93816928,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MzgxNjkyOA==","name":"flink","full_name":"dianfu/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dianfu","id":5466492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjY0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5466492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu","html_url":"https://github.com/dianfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dianfu/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, the forst reuse serialized key in any state with any namespaces, which is problematic in parallel state execution. This PR fixes this by limiting the key reuse within the most common case, where there is no user key (not map state) and no customized namespace specified (only void namespace).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Extract the common part of key reuse in Value/List/Reducing State.\r\n - Determine key reuse in constructor in those states.\r\n - Disable key reuse in MapState.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nDelete flink-scala and flink-streaming-scala modules for deprecated Scala API\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- delete flink-scala module\r\n- delete flink-streaming-scala module\r\n- add scala-lang and twitter chill dependencies to the flink-dist-scala module, as they are required by the table module\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: yes\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-24T12:09:35Z","updated_at":"2024-10-08T06:34:25Z","closed_at":"2024-10-08T06:34:24Z","merged_at":"2024-10-08T06:34:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"2f6882796cd7971eb2f69736f385d4ce1535f96f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1278774529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4Nzc0NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=ReleaseSystem","name":"component=ReleaseSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25385/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25385/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25385/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/5b5f789c1a77168de7b7b27fd95a541ad3bf79d4","head":{"label":"xintongsong:preview-process","ref":"preview-process","sha":"5b5f789c1a77168de7b7b27fd95a541ad3bf79d4","user":{"login":"xintongsong","id":6509172,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MDkxNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6509172?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong","html_url":"https://github.com/xintongsong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185968889,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU5Njg4ODk=","name":"flink","full_name":"xintongsong/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xintongsong","id":6509172,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MDkxNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6509172?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong","html_url":"https://github.com/xintongsong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xintongsong/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*For Milestone-2 of FLIP-263, this PR removes the old method of resolving schema compatibility.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Remove the old method.*\r\n  - *Remove the default implementation of the new method.*\r\n  - *Remove unnecessary tests cases.*\r\n  - *Make deprecated serializer classes throw exceptions when calling resolveSchemaCompatibility()*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-24T11:03:45Z","updated_at":"2024-09-27T02:32:03Z","closed_at":"2024-09-27T02:32:02Z","merged_at":"2024-09-27T02:32:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"be90707464342634a3cd7b52a7206fb5be1d5598","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273183016,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgzMDE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/TypeSerializationSystem","name":"component=API/TypeSerializationSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25384/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25384/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25384/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/bb929d01769c339e407d40736a5b8f47d20202bb","head":{"label":"AlexYinHan:dev_30614","ref":"dev_30614","sha":"bb929d01769c339e407d40736a5b8f47d20202bb","user":{"login":"AlexYinHan","id":31843401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODQzNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31843401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexYinHan","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexYinHan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexYinHan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexYinHan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexYinHan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexYinHan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexYinHan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexYinHan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexYinHan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexYinHan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexYinHan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":316459071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTY0NTkwNzE=","name":"flink","full_name":"AlexYinHan/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlexYinHan","id":31843401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODQzNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31843401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexYinHan","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexYinHan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexYinHan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexYinHan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexYinHan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexYinHan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexYinHan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexYinHan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexYinHan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexYinHan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexYinHan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlexYinHan/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-24T08:52:19Z","updated_at":"2024-09-25T02:51:43Z","closed_at":"2024-09-25T02:51:42Z","merged_at":"2024-09-25T02:51:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"42d918dec1658c4dc1f0586148704c46bc1dd8d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273329428,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzI5NDI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Library/CEP","name":"component=Library/CEP","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25381/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25381/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25381/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/6e12115bc598d07d74e066ae0f70fb01f1427676","head":{"label":"dianfu:cep_deprecation","ref":"cep_deprecation","sha":"6e12115bc598d07d74e066ae0f70fb01f1427676","user":{"login":"dianfu","id":5466492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjY0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5466492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu","html_url":"https://github.com/dianfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":93816928,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MzgxNjkyOA==","name":"flink","full_name":"dianfu/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dianfu","id":5466492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjY0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5466492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu","html_url":"https://github.com/dianfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dianfu/flink","description":"Mirror

This test case employs the `fullWindowPartition` operator while running in streaming job mode. \r\n\r\nThe `fullWindowPartition` operator will sets jobEdge blocking, which leads the AdaptiveScheduler fail to check whether the job edge can be pipelined (`org.apache.flink.runtime.scheduler.adaptive.AdaptiveScheduler#assertPreconditions`).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- modify the test case in `org.apache.flink.api.functions.ClosureCleanerITCase` to run in batch mode\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSaw this flaky `testAsyncCancellation` test failed with\r\n```\r\norg.apache.flink.contrib.streaming.state.RocksDBWriteBatchWrapperTest.testAsyncCancellation -- Time elapsed: 0.121 s <<< ERROR!\r\nSep 16 02:20:08 java.lang.Exception: Unexpected exception, expected<org.apache.flink.runtime.execution.CancelTaskException> but was<java.lang.AssertionError>\r\nSep 16 02:20:08 Caused by: java.lang.AssertionError: \r\nSep 16 02:20:08 Expecting actual:\r\nSep 16 02:20:08   2\r\nSep 16 02:20:08 to be less than:\r\nSep 16 02:20:08   2 \r\nSep 16 02:20:08 \tat org.apache.flink.contrib.streaming.state.RocksDBWriteBatchWrapperTest.testAsyncCancellation(RocksDBWriteBatchWrapperTest.java:98)\r\n```\r\nAfter investigation, I found this is because the slow async `register.close()` causes the main verification failure. Because the `register.close` is slow, the infinite loop will go beyond `cancellationCheckInterval * 2`. To make this test reliable, we can make sure the register is completely closed after 1st run of `writeBatchWrapper.put`, so that we can still verify we can tolerate some delay of cancellation propagation.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nMake `testAsyncCancellation` test reliable by making sure register is closed before verification\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as testAsyncCancellation.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRemoved timeouts setting in `testCloseCleansUpPreviouslyClosedFetcher` tests.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIncorrect variable naming can cause confusion for readers of flink source code. Given that this variable is involved in the computation within the Buffer Debloater mechanism(see BufferDebloater#recalculateBufferSize), it is essential to correct it, otherwise, readers will find it difficult to understand why the current throughput is multiplied by the target buffer size to calculate the total buffer size.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nRenamed misleading variable name and replaced all occurrences\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change does need any test coverage since only variable name change involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUnifiedSinkMigrationITCase assumed that we also commit partial batches of committables. However, that was never the intend and fixed in FLINK-25920. This commit adjusts the test.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-20T14:10:32Z","updated_at":"2024-09-23T10:15:08Z","closed_at":"2024-09-23T10:15:05Z","merged_at":"2024-09-23T10:15:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"300e1ea1f2c508ef8318b20b80e3840af8306d1d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25368/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25368/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25368/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/a847cf40f65f48bba7ff70b8befb34317afec6d8","head":{"label":"AHeise:remove-migration-test","ref":"remove-migration-test","sha":"a847cf40f65f48bba7ff70b8befb34317afec6d8","user":{"login":"AHeise","id":4559103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTkxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4559103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise","html_url":"https://github.com/AHeise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":433929054,"node_id":"R_kgDOGd07Xg","name":"flink","full_name":"AHeise/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AHeise","id":4559103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTkxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4559103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise","html_url":"https://github.com/AHeise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AHeise/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAfter [FLINK-36117](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-36117), we port old state backends implementation to new api using AsyncKeyedStateBackendAdaptor, but it cannot work because the KeyContext is not properly handled. This PR fixes this.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Add a listener for state context switch, make all `AsyncKeyedStateBackend` implement it.\r\n - For `AsyncKeyedStateBackendAdaptor`, set current key when a context switched.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is without any test coverage, since it is difficult to be covered by a UT.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-20T10:59:38Z","updated_at":"2024-09-23T11:27:48Z","closed_at":"2024-09-23T11:27:45Z","merged_at":"2024-09-23T11:27:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"b14ab764a0adef68334f02dd6f52e9aca61c2477","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25367/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25367/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25367/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/dcd8abaf755278813fd2ae0e94beee474a43c914","head":{"label":"Zakelly:f36338","ref":"f36338","sha":"dcd8abaf755278813fd2ae0e94beee474a43c914","user":{"login":"Zakelly","id":2986149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODYxNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2986149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly","html_url":"https://github.com/Zakelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":263260000,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjMyNjAwMDA=","name":"flink","full_name":"Zakelly/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Zakelly","id":2986149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODYxNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2986149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly","html_url":"https://github.com/Zakelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Zakelly/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRefactor the StreamGraphGenerator by introducing the JobVertexBuildContext to make more methods reusable. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Introduce the JobVertexBuildContext to store context information during the JobVertex build process.\r\n- Change methods in StreamGraphGenerator that may be reused to public static.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis is just a code refactoring and does not require new test cases.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-20T10:06:19Z","updated_at":"2024-10-14T16:31:43Z","closed_at":"2024-10-14T16:31:43Z","merged_at":"2024-10-14T16:31:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"caa032236979bdd53cdbf78ff05cceb6ec2f4d93","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25366/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25366/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25366/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/b8e932b5cd7dcdcfdf9535bd0a4b9a3ad21ec14f","head":{"label":"noorall:introduce_vertex_build_context_0920","ref":"introduce_vertex_build_context_0920","sha":"b8e932b5cd7dcdcfdf9535bd0a4b9a3ad21ec14f","user":{"login":"noorall","id":30954408,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTU0NDA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30954408?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/noorall","html_url":"https://github.com/noorall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noorall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noorall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noorall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noorall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noorall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noorall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noorall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noorall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noorall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":799859760,"node_id":"R_kgDOL6zkMA","name":"flink","full_name":"noorall/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"noorall","id":30954408,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTU0NDA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30954408?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/noorall","html_url":"https://github.com/noorall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noorall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noorall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noorall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noorall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noorall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noorall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noorall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noorall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noorall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/noorall/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRemove deprecated dataset API dependency exclude table module\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Remove deprecated dataset API dependency exclude table module\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport multiget when db all in local.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add `isRemoteDb` check\r\n- Modify `ForStGeneralMultiGetOperation`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n- `ForStGeneralMultiGetOperationTest`\r\n- `ForStStateExecutorTest`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR makes read/write state requests execute in different executors.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add `EXECUTOR_READ_IO_PARALLELISM` and `EXECUTOR_WRITE_IO_PARALLELISM` options.\r\n- Make read/write state requests execute in different executors.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests `ForStStateExecutorTest`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nBetween sink writer, the committer, and any pre/post commit topology (including global committer), we don't send actual payload but just committables. These committables must be committed on notifyCheckpointCompleted. However, if a barrier overtakes these committables, they may only be read after the RPC call has been made leading to violations. In particular, we could even have these issues during a final checkpoint.\r\n\r\nThis commit generalizes the way, we disable UC for broadcast and pointwise connections, such that the SinkTransformationTranslator can also disable it for other distribution pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Migrate SinkITCase to AssertJ\r\n* Disallow UC for inner sink channels <- main commit\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded assertion on existing SinkITCase, which looks at different topologies already.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / **don't know**)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[FLINK-36251][streaming-java] Remove StateBackend-related configuration getters/setters that return/set complex Java objects. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport state V1 interface in forst statebackend, mostly borrowed from `rocksdb keyed state backend`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Implement `ForStSyncKeyedStateBackend`\r\n- Implement `ForStSyncValueState`,`ForStSyncMapState`,`ForStSyncListState`,`ForStSyncReducingState`,`ForStSyncAggState`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? ( no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-18T07:34:26Z","updated_at":"2025-01-02T04:55:50Z","closed_at":"2024-09-20T08:09:38Z","merged_at":"2024-09-20T08:09:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"1ba890062d94edc4d9ea5431d44adaeb123d9607","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25349/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25349/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25349/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/fdabf3c05a9e48178ac81aa02793ac42b0826d88","head":{"label":"fredia:forst_sync","ref":"forst_sync","sha":"fdabf3c05a9e48178ac81aa02793ac42b0826d88","user":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":375962860,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzU5NjI4NjA=","name":"flink","full_name":"fredia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fredia/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nRemove per-job mode and run-application client command.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Remove per-job mode in `flink-yarn`, `flink-kubernetes`, and `flink-runtime` moduls\r\n- Remove run-application command in `flink-clients` module\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-18T06:18:27Z","updated_at":"2024-09-22T08:06:21Z","closed_at":"2024-09-22T08:06:21Z","merged_at":"2024-09-22T08:06:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"fe97786366619042e2c5683297c90c8ec4c00223","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25348/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25348/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25348/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/202b284b0dee405ec7b4a21d031004c5e12d0171","head":{"label":"codenohup:remove_perjob","ref":"remove_perjob","sha":"202b284b0dee405ec7b4a21d031004c5e12d0171","user":{"login":"codenohup","id":130116763,"node_id":"U_kgDOB8Fsmw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130116763?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup","html_url":"https://github.com/codenohup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":638940839,"node_id":"R_kgDOJhV2pw","name":"flink","full_name":"codenohup/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"codenohup","id":130116763,"node_id":"U_kgDOB8Fsmw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130116763?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup","html_url":"https://github.com/codenohup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/codenohup/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFLINK-36014 aligned the triggering of the execution graph creation in `WaitingForResources` and rescaling in `Executing` state. Before that change, only `WaitingForResources` relied on this method. Relying on free slots was good enough because in `WaitingForResources` state, there are no slots allocated, yet.\r\n    \r\nUsing this method for `Executing` state now as well changes this premise because there are slots allocated while checking the slot availability that would become available after the restart. Hence, considering these slots in the slot availability check is good enough. This will not break the premise for the `WaitingForResources` state.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Make the `AdaptiveScheduler#hasDesiredResources` check rely on all available slots rather than only the free slots to support this metric even in `Executing` state\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* `RescaleOnCheckpointITCase` succeeds again\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially

What is the purpose of the change\r\n* Fixes incorrect Ports display in the PrometheusReporter constructor in case of the httpServer creation failure. Instead of printing the port numbers, the error message currently displays an Iterator object reference, which is not useful for debugging.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n* Moved the `PortsRange` from the runtime module to the core module\r\n* Use `PortsRange` utility class from the core module instead of the `iterator`. This ensures that the actual ports are printed in the exception message instead of the Iterator reference.\r\n* Update the tests to rely one on the `PortsRange` as the `PrometheusReposter` only constructor parameter instead of the Iterator\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n - Extends the existing cannotStartTwoReportersOnSamePort test by checking the exception message thrown to verify that the log message contains the actual ports and not the object reference.\r\n- Examples \r\n   - before: `Could not start PrometheusReporter HTTP server on any configured port. Ports: org.apache.flink.util.UnionIterator@67065fd3` \r\n   - after: `Could not start PrometheusReporter HTTP server on any configured port. Ports: [9000, 9001, 9002, ...]` \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no \r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n\r\n### TBD\r\nI have also considered changing the constructor parameter from `Iterable<Integer>` to `List<Integer>`, as it would provide a more straightforward way to manage the port numbers. This change would require minor adjustments in the codebase, namely modifying the `PrometheusReporterFactory` and some test cases, which currently use `Iterable<Integer>` and would need conversion to `List<Integer>`. I’d like to discuss if this change is worthwhile, as it could improve code clarity but requires slightly more effort.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, converting the `Iterable<Integer>` to a `List<Integer>` at the beginning of the constructor, and then attempting to create the HTTP server using this list, could also be a solution. In my opinion, this would make the code a bit cleaner and easier to read. However, it would require iterating over the ports twice: once when converting the `Iterable` to a list, and again during the actual HTTP server initialization. While this extra iteration may have a small impact on performance, I don't think it would be significant enough to cause issues.\r\n\r\n**Questions for Discussion**:\r\n- Is it worth refactoring the constructor to use `List<Integer>` instead of `Iterable<Integer>`, considering the minor adjustments required across the codebase?\r\n- Would the conversion from `Iterable` to `List` in the

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-14T14:15:24Z","updated_at":"2024-09-14T14:18:56Z","closed_at":"2024-09-14T14:17:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"263068aabccd2b3a337cff9f99c83db61c22e888","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25337/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25337/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25337/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/542dd5bf7a65e1894a7b13b66c84beb56bc025bb","head":{"label":"wangjunyou:master","ref":"master","sha":"542dd5bf7a65e1894a7b13b66c84beb56bc025bb","user":{"login":"wangjunyou","id":19574056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTc0MDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19574056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjunyou","html_url":"https://github.com/wangjunyou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjunyou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjunyou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjunyou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjunyou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjunyou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjunyou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjunyou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjunyou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangjunyou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"ed7f57c9ccb23957e24a79668daf2302ba29a125","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRemove CheckpointStorage-related configuration getters/setters that return/set complex Java objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRemove legacy SourceFunction / SinkFunction / Sink V1 API in 2.0\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. Rename SourceFunction / SinkFunction to LegacySourceFunction / LegacySinkFunction, and mark them as Internal interface. Some class that implemented SourceFunction / SinkFunction with PublicEvolving were also renamed.\r\n2. Remove Sink V1 API and relevant usage. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAll test case that used Sink V1 API had been rewritten with Sink V2 API.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes (only test scope)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nA document to guide user to update SourceFunction with Source API is needed.\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-14T02:00:10Z","updated_at":"2024-10-09T05:53:33Z","closed_at":"2024-09-30T07:57:27Z","merged_at":"2024-09-30T07:57:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"f2d6b5753dbf1a9fae3f6404100ce69daad8d221","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25331/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25331/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25331/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/2b10eef43c9993936a6e1e97d71de6eb9880d108","head":{"label":"lvyanquan:FLINK-36245","ref":"FLINK-36245","sha":"2b10eef43c9993936a6e1e97d71de6eb9880d108","user":{"login":"lvyanquan","id":38547014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ3MDE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38547014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvyanquan","html_url":"https://github.com/lvyanquan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvyanquan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvyanquan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvyanquan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvyanquan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvyanquan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvyanquan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvyanquan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvyanquan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvyanquan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":705424128,"node_id":"R_kgDOKgvrAA","name":"flink","full_name":"lvyanquan/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lvyanquan","id":38547014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ3MDE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38547014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvyanquan","html_url":"https://github.com/lvyanquan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvyanquan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvyanquan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvyanquan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvyanquan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvyanquan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvyanquan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvyanquan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvyanquan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lvyanquan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lvyanquan/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-14T01:34:18Z","updated_at":"2024-09-14T05:16:00Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e251cb6fce270d134925baede49820158fad8cec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25330/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25330/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25330/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/31826ea0e5754ad429e9854f65b4ca16ea1a3511","head":{"label":"garywangcoding:patch-2","ref":"patch-2","sha":"31826ea0e5754ad429e9854f65b4ca16ea1a3511","user":{"login":"garywangcoding","id":92965917,"node_id":"U_kgDOBYqMHQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92965917?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garywangcoding","html_url":"https://github.com/garywangcoding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garywangcoding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garywangcoding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garywangcoding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garywangcoding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garywangcoding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garywangcoding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garywangcoding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garywangcoding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garywangcoding/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":857178896,"node_id":"R_kgDOMxeDEA","name":"flink","full_name":"garywangcoding/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"garywangcoding","id":92965917,"node_id":"U_kgDOBYqMHQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92965917?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garywangcoding","html_url":"https://github.com/garywangcoding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garywangcoding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garywangcoding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garywangcoding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garywangcoding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garywangcoding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garywangcoding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garywangcoding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garywangcoding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garywangcoding/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/garywangcoding/flink","description":"Apache
