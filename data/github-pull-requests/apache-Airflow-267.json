sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4338\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR changes k8s pod_request_factory to use yaml safe_load and fixes yaml.load deprecation warning.\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\nBefore Python yaml version 5.1 yaml has used the UnsafeLoader that has a potential security vulnerability. From now on there is a FullLoader that will be used by default that fixes these vulnerability. To suppress the warning we can explicitly set the loader or use a shortcut function like **safe_load**\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/wiki/PyYAML-yaml.load(input)-Deprecation for more details.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4337\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a docker-compose deprecation warning for the `--parallel` flag in our CI.\r\n\r\nSince docker-compose 1.21.0 the `–-parallel` flag is deprecated.\r\n\r\n> docker-compose pull is now performed in parallel by default. You can opt out using the --no-parallel flag. The --parallel flag is now deprecated and will be removed in a future version.\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1210-2018-04-10\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4294\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4325\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis fixes a regression when a dag_id has a '.' character in its name. The new UI uses \"safe\" dag_ids for the IDs of the corresponding DOM elements and when the endpoint `/dag_stats` returns the payload keyed on the regular dag_id, d3 is unable to update the elements.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to convert the dag_ids in the payload to a 'safe' dag_id by replacing all the `.` characters with `__dot__` so the relevant DOM elements can be selected and updated\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![airflow 1 10 3 missing task and dag runs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17157/56182011-eadb9a80-5fc4-11e9-8476-2b898b0bb02f.png)\r\n\r\nAfter change:\r\n![task and dag runs fix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17157/56182016-f29b3f00-5fc4-11e9-8894-9a16207ca829.png)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nManual testing confirms that it show dag runs and task runs correctly\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n**N/A**\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4321\r\n \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nMany places in Airflow docs for GCS it is mentioned that \"Google cloud storage allows for files\r\nto be a maximum of 4GB.\"\r\n\r\nThe limit is not 4GB it's 5TB:\r\nhttps://cloud.google.com/storage/quotas\r\n\"There is a maximum size limit of 5 TB for individual objects stored in Cloud Storage.\"\r\nI think in general It's best not to mention it at all. The limits can change at will. Airflow can't keep track of all size changes.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nn/a - doc change\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-15T14:33:19Z","updated_at":"2019-08-30T20:39:39Z","closed_at":"2019-04-15T15:32:13Z","merged_at":"2019-04-15T15:32:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"91a4478264febb104205120ee1288c52ad97586d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5106/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5106/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5106/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/1fc03d75e94fa035c658e19594dc699944fb5eea","head":{"label":"kaxil:AIRFLOW-4321-Replace-incorrect-info-of-Max-Size-limit-of-GCS-Object-Size","ref":"AIRFLOW-4321-Replace-incorrect-info-of-Max-Size-limit-of-GCS-Object-Size","sha":"1fc03d75e94fa035c658e19594dc699944fb5eea","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":112322392,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTIzMjIzOTI=","name":"airflow","full_name":"kaxil/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-594\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-594\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-594\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n  This PR is a precursor to loading DAGs from pip packages. It provides a new plugin structure, `AirflowPluginDagSource` with two methods `collect_dags_from_plugins` and `put_dag_plugins_on_disk` where a Plugin author can:\r\n -  implement the former and provide logic to inject the `airflow.model.DAG` objects into a provided `airflow.modal.DagBag` object using their own custom logic,\r\n - or implement the latter and provide logic to write the dag python files to disk in the dag folder where they will be collected by the normal DAG loading setup.\r\n\r\nFrom discussion below, potential use cases could be:\r\n - to load dags from pip packages\r\n - to load dags from (for example) S3, GCP Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage (using the built in hooks/connections);\r\n - integration with say, https://github.com/wooga/airconditioner without mixing yaml and python for dag definitions;\r\n - tighter integration with https://github.com/python-bonobo/bonobo\r\n - as an intermediary step to handle some automatic lineage injection on DAG load\r\n - perform some validation or linting of DAGs before loading.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-12T05:54:33Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T15:26:54Z","closed_at":"2019-09-11T15:26:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5a410517ab8c3e0d9b3402a5507a26a9baba73cf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

PR title.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n* **Behavior change**:\r\n  * manual run task from webserver will need to satisfy same deps used by scheduler to schedule a task.\r\n    * We can ignore deps anyway, current inconsistency makes people confuse.\r\n\r\n* Optimization:\r\n  * dep contexts are renamed to better reflected their purpose, optimized existing contexts and added new deps to avoid redundant checks and better reflect actual scheduling logic. Task Instance detail page will now show all-1 reasons why scheduler won't schedule the task.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n`tests.models.test_taskinstance.py:TaskInstanceTest.test_requeue_over_dag_concurrency`\r\n`tests.models.test_taskinstance.py:TaskInstanceTest.test_requeue_over_task_concurrency`\r\n`tests.models.test_taskinstance.py:TaskInstanceTest.test_requeue_over_pool_concurrency`\r\n`tests.models.test_taskinstance.py:TaskInstanceTest.test_not_requeue_non_requeueable_task_instance`\r\n`tests.models.test_taskinstance.py:TaskInstanceTest.test_mark_non_runnable_task_as_success`\r\n`tests.ti_deps.deps.test_dagrun_id_dep.py`\r\n`tests.ti_deps.deps.test_pool_slots_available_dep.py`\r\n\r\nAnd some minor updates/ refactoring for existing test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [AIRFLOW-4262](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4262) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4262\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis PR is to fix SlackWebhookHook malfunction. It ensures that SlackWebhookHook can take either `http_conn_id` or `webhook_token`, or both, to POST messages into a slack channel, as said in the [docstring](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/4d34632fafe2f0bb8fcd67bb0964315eeb5c4fa9/airflow/contrib/hooks/slack_webhook_hook.py#L28-L30)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  1. My PR adds test to ensure correct url and http method is hit by SlackWebhookHook if only `http_conn_id` is supplied.\r\n  2. My PR adds test to ensure correct url and http method is hit by SlackWebhookHook if only `webhook_token` is supplied.\r\n  3. My PR adds test to ensure correct url and http method is hit by SlackWebhookHook if both `http_conn_id` and `webhook_token` is supplied.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4260\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nSince sphinx version 1.8 `autodoc_default_flags` is deprecated and can be replaced by using `autodoc_default_options` instead.\r\n\r\nSee: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html#confval-autodoc_default_flags (and right below this option is the new one)\r\n\r\nSince sphinx version 1.8 `viewcode_import` is deprecated. It has been renamed to `viewcode_follow_imported_members`\r\n\r\nSee https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/usage/extensions/viewcode.html#confval-viewcode_follow_imported_members\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-08T11:36:20Z","updated_at":"2019-04-09T12:08:19Z","closed_at":"2019-04-09T08:43:46Z","merged_at":"2019-04-09T08:43:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"ccf816428ca0f0409d2676a494f5bc629ca0773c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5064/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5064/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5064/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/2332c476074345fd92f7f599e958deba9c3c7bb1","head":{"label":"feluelle:bug/AIRFLOW-4260-fix-sphinx-deprecation-warning-for-autodoc_default_options","ref":"bug/AIRFLOW-4260-fix-sphinx-deprecation-warning-for-autodoc_default_options","sha":"2332c476074345fd92f7f599e958deba9c3c7bb1","user":{"login":"feluelle","id":23282078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjgyMDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23282078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle","html_url":"https://github.com/feluelle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":122377019,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjIzNzcwMTk=","name":"airflow","full_name":"feluelle/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"feluelle","id":23282078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjgyMDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23282078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle","html_url":"https://github.com/feluelle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/feluelle/airflow","description":"Apache

PR finalizes the move of all classes out of the infamous models.py (including test_models.py). It's a big PR since all classes are tightly coupled which made it impossible to move out one by one. Some of the non-straight-forward things to point out:\r\n\r\n- To preserve backwards compatibility, `airflow/models/__init__.py` imports all (sub)modules (So you can still import `airflow.models.DAG` instead of `airflow.models.dag.DAG`).\r\n- Additionally (resulting from discussion below), `Connection` was imported everywhere as `airflow.models.connection.Connection`, which I now also imported in `airflow/models/__init__.py`, so that can now be imported as `airflow.models.Connection`.\r\n- Classes `DAG` and `DagModel` are in the same file since they both depend on the `get_last_dagrun()` function.\r\n- I placed classes and variables related to fernet in `airflow/models/crypto.py`.\r\n- I had to fix (i.e. disentangle) several weird imports along the way which broke and didn't make sense. Mostly related to `airflow.models` importing absolutely everything in the Airflow project, and other files depending on the import in `airflow.models` instead of the actual module. Some examples:\r\n\t- `AirflowException` was imported in `airflow/models/__init__.py` and multiple other files imported from `airflow.models` while it's defined in `airflow.exceptions`.\r\n\t- Same for TriggerRule, this was imported in `airflow/models/__init__.py` and multiple other files imported TriggerRule from there. However, it's defined in `airflow.utils.trigger_rule.TriggerRule`, so I removed it from models and corrected those imports.\r\n\t- Same for `airflow.utils.timezone`.\r\n\t- `tests/test_models.py` turned out to import `State` twice, once via `from airflow.models import State as ST` and once via `from airflow.utils.state import State`. I removed the `ST` import.\r\n\t- Some mocks had to be changed because you have to mock from the location where you use the function/var/whatever. For example, in tests/test_models.py:TaskInstanceTest.test_email_alert I had to change `@patch('airflow.models.send_email')` into `@patch('airflow.models.taskinstance.send_email')` because it's now called from there and not airflow.models.\r\n- The `global _CONTEXT_MANAGER_DAG` gave some trouble because a global cannot be shared over multiple files, which made it impossible to split the BaseOperator and DAG. So, I placed the `_CONTEXT_MANAGER_DAG` in airflow/settings.py, and simply import from there. The added benefit is that `global` isn't even needed! Bye bye global :-) More info: https://stackoverflow.com/a/13034908/3066428\r\n\r\nI have 3 questions:\r\n\r\n1. ~Since this PR relates to AIRFLOW-3456, AIRFLOW-3460, AIRFLOW-3465, AIRFLOW-3466, AIRFLOW-3470, AIRFLOW-3473 and AIRFLOW-3579, what title should I give the PR? Perhaps we could make a parent JIRA issue and place all these items as subissues. @Fokko any thoughts?~ Created parent JIRA ticket and referenced that.\r\n2. ~In the previous moves we did not preserve backwards compatibility, i.e. models are not imported in airflow.models, instead you now have to do e.g. `from airflow.models.slamiss import SlaMiss`. Should we fix these and import all not-imported models in `airflow.models` after all? And if so: in this PR or separate PR?~ Imported all already moved classes in `airflow/models/__init__.py`.\r\n3. ~Classes `DAG` and `DagModel` are in the same file since they both depend on the `get_last_dagrun()` function. Any strong opinions on keeping it this way, or moving the `get_last_dagrun()` function elsewhere so we can split `DAG` and `DagModel`?~ Left as is.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4259\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo new tests, only split tests/test_models.py into modules corresponding to airflow.models.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4255\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nhttps://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/client-libraries-explained\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud Client Libraries use our latest client library model and are our recommended option for accessing Cloud APIs programmatically, where available.\r\n\r\nhttps://pypi.org/project/google-cloud-storage/ library is available and we should be using that.\r\n\r\nThis is **Part 1**  of probably 3 parts. I am trying to not break any changes in this PR and keep it backward compatible so that we could include it in a patch or minor version release.\r\n\r\nThe 2nd & 3rd PR would contain some breaking changes and will contain notes in Updating.md\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThe current tests already cover some and will add few more tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n\r\ncc @fenglu-g

flexible implementation of dockerOperator class that takes all the\r\ncontainers config arguments in json kwargs dynamically.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3063\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe default docker compose operator is great solution to isolate and scale the execution of dag tasks, but when it comes to use it in real complex tasks, we quickly notice that we can not use all the arguments and parameters to customise the containers available in the official Docker python lib. In this PR, we provide a flexible approach that allows to provide all the possible arguments for create_container method in kwargs object, instead of having only some of them listed in the constructor of the class.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThe original unitest of docker operator lib where updated to work with the modifications implemented in the class, and some new unit tests have been added as well.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4248\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe `FileProcessorHandler`'s `_init_file` method can trigger an unhandled exception due to a race condition when multiple processes attempt to create the same directory on a shared filesystem.  When this occurs a `FileExistsError` is raised, and if it is the scheduler process, can prevent tasks from starting until the scheduler is restarted.\r\n\r\nThis PR catches the exception and handles it similarly to how it's done when using the `exists_ok=True` argument of Python v3.2's `os.makedirs` function , which does an `isdir()` call instead of checking for the `EEXIST` error code (comments in `os.makedirs` state that checking for this error code is unreliable because the OS can return other error codes instead).  This PR also replaces the existing `EEXIST` check in the `FileProcessorHandler.__init__` method to instead use `isdir()`.\r\n\r\nNote: It'd be slightly nicer to just use the `os.makdirs(exists_ok=True)` parameter instead, which can be done if this PR becomes dependent upon `AIP-3`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [N/A] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-4246\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4246\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-4246\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nInstalling `Flask-OAuthlib` results in unresolveable dependencies due to updates to the following dependencies:\r\n`oauthlib`\r\n`requests-oauthlib`\r\n\r\nPinning these versions allows `Flask-OAuthlib` to work as expected.  This has been pinned so including both `google_auth` and `github_enterprise` will install the same packages as defined in `flask_oauth`.\r\n  \r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4240\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] To make the requests POSTs and to follow the redirect that the backend\r\nissue I turned the \"toggle\" buttons in to an actual form, which makes\r\nthere much less logic needed to build up the URL - the browser handles\r\nit all for us. The only thing we have to do is set the \"action\" on the\r\nURL.\r\n\r\n  For the \"link\" ones (delete,trigger,refresh) I wrote a short\r\n`postAsForm` which takes the URL and submits a form. A little bit messy,\r\nbut it works.\r\n\r\n  (This is the same/similar change as in #5039 but against current master vs 1.10 release branch)\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] Tests updated, and manually tested the UI.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

the redirect that the backend\r\nissue I turned the \"toggle\" buttons in to an actual form, which makes\r\nthere much less logic needed to build up the URL - the browser handles\r\nit all for us. The only thing we have to do is set the \"action\" on the\r\nURL.\r\n\r\n  For the \"link\" ones (delete,trigger,refresh) I wrote a short\r\n`postAsForm` which takes the URL and submits a form. A little bit messy,\r\nbut it works.\r\n\r\n  No visual change.\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] Updated\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4237\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nCurrently (in master), Gantt chart doesn't show the true picture of the try number of task instance. In case of failure of any task, it only shows the final task state with out any try number. In this, I am gonna include the try number in the Gantt chart so that we can get to know the number of times that task ran.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/AIRFLOW/issues/AIRFLOW-4218\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nKubernetes Python client corev1 apis supports passing arguments like timeouts, async, etc. - https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/blob/master/kubernetes/client/apis/core_v1_api.py\r\nI would want to pass these arguments when using K8Executor mode by specifying args in kubernetes section of airflow.cfg as single line json dict string.\r\n\r\nPS. args only used in K8executor and not in K8PodOperator.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4235\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn wide screens, home page dags table becomes too wide. There is too much distance between \"DAG\" and \"Links\" columns and it is difficult to appreciate which is the icon you should click.\r\n\r\nIt would be very useful to highlight row on mouse hover.\r\n\r\n![table_dags_table_hover](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/491106/55535515-c4aa2680-56b7-11e9-99b0-850e353c25bd.png)\r\n\r\nThis could be fixed very quickly, adding 'table-hover' css class to table#dags.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4232) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAdd a \"none_skipped\" trigger rule so that downstream tasks will only run if all their upstream tasks have succeeded or failed.\r\n\r\n##### Example:\r\n* Task 1 is a transform task that creates a temp table.\r\n* Task 2 is a cleanup task that drops the temp table.\r\n\r\nTask 1 >> Task 2\r\n\r\nIf Task 1 succeeds or fails, Task 2 should drop the temp table as cleanup. However if the task never runs, we should just skip it.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps Task 2 is a logging task that only logs successes and failures, but doesn't log skips to cut down on noise.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the
