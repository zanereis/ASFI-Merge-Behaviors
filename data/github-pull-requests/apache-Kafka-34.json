The `resumeDeletions` method is called from multiple places and is the core logic responsible for executing the deletion. Therefore, adding comments to indicate where this method is being called can help better understand this part of the logic.\r\n2. The `isTopicDeletionInProgress` method has the same name and parameters in both `TopicDeletionManager` and `ControllerContext`, but the meanings they express are entirely different. In the context of `TopicDeletionManager`, this method accurately indicates whether any replicas of the corresponding topic are currently in the process of being deleted on the broker. Topics in this state are not eligible for further deletion logic. On the other hand, in `ControllerContext`, the method simply indicates whether the topic has begun the deletion process, regardless of whether it is in the pre-deletion, mid-deletion, or post-deletion state on the broker. Therefore, the meanings and roles of the two methods are completely different, and having the same name can cause confusion when reading the code. To address this issue, it is recommended to rename the `isTopicDeletionInProgress` method in one or both classes to more accurately reflect their respective meanings. For example, in `TopicDeletionManager`, the method could be renamed to `isTopicReplicaDeletionInProgress` to emphasize that it checks for replicas of the topic that are currently being deleted. And in `ControllerContext`, the method `isTopicDeletionInProgress` could clarify that it only checks if the deletion process has begun for the topic. By doing so, code readability and maintainability will be improved, and confusion will be reduced.","created_at":"2024-03-15T03:24:24Z","updated_at":"2025-01-05T03:38:20Z","closed_at":"2025-01-05T03:38:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cd994bc5db761940dc471e39989e4bdd5a45c7e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jlprat","id":3337739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzc3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3337739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat","html_url":"https://github.com/jlprat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlprat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820768376,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NjgzNzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/docs","name":"docs","color":"017c4f","default":false,"description":null},{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

the group coordinator is under heavy load, the current mechanism to release pending events based on updated high watermark, which consist in pushing an event at the end of the queue, is bad because

issue [KAFKA-16359](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16359) reported inclusion of `kafka-clients` runtime dependencies in MANIFEST.MF `Class-Path`.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is the issue defined [here](https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow/issues/324) with the usage of `shadow` plugin.\r\n\r\nLooking into the specifics of plugin and [documentation](https://imperceptiblethoughts.com/shadow/configuration/#configuring-the-runtime-classpath), specifies that any dependency marked as `shadow` will be treated as following by the shadow plugin:\r\n\r\n1. Adds the dependency as runtime dependency in resultant pom.xml - [code here](https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow/blob/1d647471b9130d35b17771a50be382f6cb442d71/src/main/groovy/com/github/jengelman/gradle/plugins/shadow/ShadowExtension.groovy#L32)\r\n2. Adds the dependency as `Class-Path` in `MANIFEST.MF` as well - [code here](https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow/blob/1d647471b9130d35b17771a50be382f6cb442d71/src/main/groovy/com/github/jengelman/gradle/plugins/shadow/ShadowJavaPlugin.groovy#L71)\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\nWe do need the runtime dependencies available in the pom (1 above) but not on manifest (2 above). Also there is no clear way to separate the behaviour as both above tasks relies on `shadow` configuration. \r\n\r\nTo fix, I have defined another custom configuration named `shadowed` which is later used to populate the correct pom (the [code is similar to what shadow plugin does](https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow/blob/1d647471b9130d35b17771a50be382f6cb442d71/src/main/groovy/com/github/jengelman/gradle/plugins/shadow/ShadowExtension.groovy#L32) to populate pom for runtime dependencies).\r\n\r\nThough this might seem like a workaround, but I think that's the only way to fix the issue. I have checked other SDKs which suffered with same issue and went with similar route to populate pom.\r\n\r\n### Verification\r\n\r\n1. Exploded jar by `jar -xvf kafka-clients....jar` and compared pre and post manifest contents.\r\n![Screenshot 2024-03-13 at 9 37 16 PM](https://github.com/apache/kafka/assets/2861565/bffa07f1-f8a6-4c77-a4e0-3b38c0968fc7)\r\n\r\n2.

subtle difference in the behavior of the two API causes the failures with `Invalid negative timestamp`.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the list offsets response will be processed differently based on the API.  For beginingOffsets/endOffsets - the offset response should be directly returned.\r\n\r\nFor offsetsForTimes - A `OffsetAndTimestamp` object is constructed for each requested TopicPartition before being returned.\r\n\r\nThe reason beginningOffsets and endOffsets - We are expecting a -1 timestamp from the response which subsequently causes the invalid timestamp exception because the original code tries to construct an `OffsetAndTimestamp` object upon returning.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the following missing tasks are added:\r\n1. short-circuit both beginningOrEndOffsets\r\n2. Test both API (beginningOrEndOffsets, OffsetsForTime)\r\n3.

goal of this PR is to change the following internals of the reconciliation:\r\n\r\n - Introduce a \"local epoch\" to the local target assignment. When a new target is received by the server, we compare it with the current value. If it is the same, no change. Otherwise, we bump the local epoch and store the new target assignment. Then, on the reconciliation, we also store the epoch in the reconciled assignment and keep using target != current to trigger the reconciliation. \r\n - When we are not in a group (we have not received an assignment), we use null to represent the local target assignment instead of an empty list, to avoid confusions with an empty assignment received by the server. Similarly, we use null to represent the current assignment, when we haven't reconciled the assignment yet.\r\n - We also carry the new epoch into the request builder to ensure that we report the owned partitions for the last local epoch.\r\n - To address [KAFKA-16312](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16312) (call onPartitionsAssigned on empty assignments after joining), we apply the initial assignment returned by the group coordinator (whether empty or not) as a normal reconciliation. This avoids introducing another code path to trigger rebalance listeners - reconciliation is the only way to transition to STABLE. The unneeded parts of reconciliation (autocommit, revocation) will be skipped in the existing. Since a lot of unit tests assumed that not reconciliation behavior is invoked when joining the group with an empty assignment, this required a lot of the changes in the unit tests.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThese changes allow the new consumer to pass the first 10 system tests. We piggy-back a minor change to the `HeartbeatManager` that are required for those system tests as well: always send `rebalanceTimoutMs`, `subscriptions` when (re-)joining.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-11T15:37:38Z","updated_at":"2025-01-08T10:59:12Z","closed_at":"2024-03-18T10:52:23Z","merged_at":"2024-03-18T10:52:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"5c929874b88b3b96f650de0f733d93d42ac535a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5536940330,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABSgcBKg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/ctr","name":"ctr","color":"554CC1","default":false,"description":"Consumer

I noticed while working on a new feature -- this class has deprecated its hashcode and actually goes so far as to throw an exception if/when it's invoked. The deprecation note claims this is because the class is mutable, but I don't actually see this happening anywhere in the code. The _reference_ to this object is modified during processing (by the ProcessorContext), but the object itself has no setters and all fields are private.~~\r\n\r\n~~Given the deprecation was years ago, I'm guessing we simply changed from mutating the actual record context object to mutating the reference stored by the ProcessorContext sometime in the past few years, and forgot to remove this deprecation/exception~~ \r\n\r\nupdate: turns out the existing javadocs were accurate/up-to-date after all, and the class actually isn't technically safe for use in hash collections. Given the lack of explanation or detail in the javadocs was what lead to my misunderstanding (in addition to my own foolishness, of course) I figure it makes sense to convert this PR into a docs improvement instead of simply closing it.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the javadocs for the \"deprecated\" hashCode() method of ProcessorRecordContext, as well as the UnsupportedOperationException thrown in its implementation, to actually explain why the class is mutable and therefore unsafe for use in hash collections. They now point out the mutable field in the class (namely the

noticed that were were a few implementation quirks with the implementation of `BoundedList.java` that could potentially lead to bugs if used improperly.\r\n\r\n1. A constructor like method with signature `newArrayBacked(int maxLength, int initialCapacity)` took in two integers, one for the maximum length of the `BoundedList`, and a second for the initial capacity of the underlying `ArrayList`. This seems like a flaw to me because when ArrayLists resize it is a O(n) operation, so if the initial capacity was \"under-provisioned\" compared to the maximum capacity, many resizing operations could take place as this list grows, which is not good for performance.\r\n\r\nFix: Remove `newArrayBacked(int maxLength, int initialCapacity)` and use the new constructor instead (mentioned below).\r\n\r\n2. The public constructor had a signature of `public BoundedList(int maxLength, List<E> underlying)`. This is problematic because the the constructor created the `BoundedList` using a reference to `underlying`, not a copy of it; therefore, a user could add elements to `underlying` instead of their newly instantiated `BoundedList` and force the `BoundedList` to be larger than its maxLength`.\r\n\r\nFix: Change the constructor to have signature `public BoundedList(int maxLength)`. I noticed that passing in a \"original list\" was only used in unit tests, never in the source code, but I felt that made the unit tests confusing. If this use case is ever needed, it can be added in again later on.\r\n\r\n3. Remaining changes involve updating the usages of `BoundedList` and cleaning up the unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

Bug\r\nOn startup, Kafka creates a checkpoint for broker metadata. If underlying storage throws an IOException for any reason (maybe disk is full), then Kafka should mark the directory as offline. However, in this case it doesn't do so.\r\n\r\n## Root cause\r\nWhen marking the partition offline, we incorrectly pass the path of checkpoint file whereas we should be providing the path of log dir\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nAdded a unit test that fails prior to this change and passes after it is successful. \r\n\r\n## Note\r\nNote that this change is made on 3.6.x branch. 3.7.x/trunk may already be fixed as part of https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/7060c08d6f9b0408e7f40a90499caf2e636fac61.

a part of KIP-890, we are introducing a new class of Exceptions which when encountered shall lead to Aborting the ongoing Transaction. The following PR introduces the same with client side handling and server side changes.\r\n\r\n- On client Side, the code attempts to handle the exception as an Abortable error and ensure that it doesn't take the producer to a fatal state. For each of the Transactional APIs, we have added the appropriate handling. For the produce request, we have verified that the exception transitions the state to Aborted.\r\n- On the server side, we have bumped the ProduceRequest, ProduceResponse, TxnOffestCommitRequest and TxnOffsetCommitResponse Version. The appropriate handling on the server side has been added to ensure that the new error case is sent back only for the new clients. The older clients will continue to get the old Invalid_txn_state exception to maintain backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-07T07:25:22Z","updated_at":"2024-03-28T04:33:48Z","closed_at":"2024-03-22T18:26:07Z","merged_at":"2024-03-22T18:26:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"2e8d69b78ca52196decd851c8520798aa856c073","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15486/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15486/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/15486/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/3a985ef0671a580051377e0b06baf003cd1019aa","head":{"label":"sjhajharia:kip-890-error-handling","ref":"kip-890-error-handling","sha":"3a985ef0671a580051377e0b06baf003cd1019aa","user":{"login":"sjhajharia","id":122860866,"node_id":"U_kgDOB1K1Qg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122860866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjhajharia","html_url":"https://github.com/sjhajharia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjhajharia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjhajharia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjhajharia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjhajharia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjhajharia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjhajharia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjhajharia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjhajharia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjhajharia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":740885571,"node_id":"R_kgDOLCkEQw","name":"kafka","full_name":"sjhajharia/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sjhajharia","id":122860866,"node_id":"U_kgDOB1K1Qg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122860866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjhajharia","html_url":"https://github.com/sjhajharia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjhajharia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjhajharia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjhajharia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjhajharia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjhajharia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjhajharia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjhajharia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjhajharia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjhajharia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sjhajharia/kafka","description":"Mirror

test causes the build to fail with the current ShutdownableThread implementation that calls Exit.\r\nThis is because Exit is inherently thread-unsafe, and ShutdownableThread may live longer than the exit procedures are masked.\r\n\r\nThis can be prevented by changing the reset behavior of the Exit class. Because the Exit.set and Exit.reset methods are by convention only called in test code, once any of these methods is called, the Exit class will no longer call the system exit procedures, even if a race condition were to occur.\r\n\r\nI explored other ways of refactoring/replacing the Exit class, but they're all extremely involved and would cause a lot of code churn. I think that we should still pursue them in the future, but wait until ZK code/tests are removed and number of call-sites in the tools package can be reduced.\r\n\r\nAlso as part of this PR i migrated the ShutdownableThreadTest to Java, and added some advisory javadocs to the Exit classes.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n-

https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13760 introduced a problem with KafkaAdmin.deleteRecords. If the request acted on a set of topic-partitions which spanned multiple leader brokers, the request for all of the topic-partitions were sent to all brokers. While this technically worked, it did mean that every broker handled its own topic-partitions and failed all of the ones that it didn't lead. This meant that every topic-partition was acted on, but at the cost of a lot of failed subrequests.\r\n\r\nThe code was not paying attention to the mapping from node to topic-partition passed into `DeleteRecordsHandler.buildBatchedRequest`. This PR filters the subrequests for each node based on the mapping passed into that method.\r\n\r\nOne of the existing unit tests actually codified the wrong behavior, so that has been fixed.

Context\r\nPreviously in the LogValidator, the `offsetOfMaxTimestamp` depends on two parameter check\r\n1. timestampType\r\n2. batch.toMagic\r\n\r\nIf the `timestampType` is `LOG_APPEND_TIME`, and the `toMagic` is larger or equals to `MAGIC_VALUE_V2`, then we assign `offsetCounter.value - 1` to it, otherwise keep the initial value.\r\n\r\nHowever, in [KAFKA-14477](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14477), this was changed, which modify `offsetOfMaxTimestamp` no matter whether it's `LOG_APPEND_TIME` or not, but only verify the `toMagic`, which led to this issue. More details can be found in [KAFKA-16310](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16310)\r\n\r\nBesides, in [KIP-734](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-734%3A+Improve+AdminClient.listOffsets+to+return+timestamp+and+offset+for+the+record+with+the+largest+timestamp), we have enables `MAX_TIMESTAMP` of listOffset, where the name `shallowOffsetOfMaxTimestamp` become confusing since we actually get the offset of the max timestamp at the record level, not in the batch level.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n- Fix the verifying logic. If it's `LOG_APPEND_TIME`, we choose the offset of the first record. Else, we choose the record with the maxTimeStamp. \r\n- rename the shallowOffsetOfMaxTimestamp to offsetOfMaxTimestamp\r\n\r\n## Test\r\ntest with\r\n```\r\n./gradlew clean core:test --tests kafka.log.LogValidatorTest\r\n./gradlew clean client:test --tests org.apache.kafka.common.record.MemoryRecordsBuilderTest\r\n./gradlew clean core:test --tests kafka.admin.ListOffsetsIntegrationTest\r\n./gradlew clean core:test --tests kafka.log.LogSegmentTest\r\n./gradlew clean core:test --tests kafka.log.LocalLogTest \r\n./gradlew clean client:test --tests org.apache.kafka.common.record.MemoryRecordsBuilderTest\r\n```\r\nand it passed\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16252\r\n\r\n### Background & Modification\r\nCurrently, there are few document files generated automatically like the task `genConnectMetricsDocs` \r\nHowever, the unwanted log information also added into it. \r\nAnd the format is not aligned with other which has Mbean located of the third column.\r\n\r\nI modified the code logic so the format could follow other section in `ops.html`\r\nAlso close the log since we take everything from the std as a documentation\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nRegen the docs and compare the format\r\n\r\n####

Values class has checkstyle suppressions for NPathComplexity, MethodLength, CyclomaticComplexity, and JavaNCSS. Rather than suppressing these problems, we should refactor the oversize methods into smaller methods that satisfy the checkstyle heuristics.\r\n\r\nI added a benchmark to verify that this refactoring does not cause a performance regression. Once I had the benchmark, I found some really obvious optimizations:\r\n\r\n* parseAsTemporal was catching ParseExceptions, and I eliminated those by checking the ParsePosition.\r\n* number parsing was catching multiple ArithmeticExceptions when numbers had decimal parts, or were too large to fit in certain types. The new implementation does some equivalent rounding and cast-checking to avoid the exceptions.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, the parse() profile shows a significant improvement, while all of the other methods are nearly the same or slightly faster than before. I'll include the detailed results from my machine in a follow-up comment.\r\n\r\nFinally I just did some simplification that makes the generic convertTo method call the specific convertTo(Boolean,Byte, etc) methods, rather than having every one of the specific methods call the single generic method. This eliminates the need for casting Object to the return types, and eliminates flaws that could come from that cast failing. I fixed one such flaw in #15399 that I found while doing this refactor.\r\n\r\nThe SchemaMerger is a refactor of the fix in #15399 because the additional variables and control flow exceeded the checkstyle heuristics.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

This should not have any functional changes.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

few minor optimizations:\r\n1. Cache the interbroker listener name instead of computing it each time. The value of the interbroker listener name cannot change without a process restart, and the `KafkaConfig.interBrokerListenerName` call can be quite expensive.\r\n2. we're currently grabbing all partitions for the transaction state topic in getTransactionCoordinator. Instead, just query the partition we care about. This also simplifies the code somewhat since `getPartitionInfo` does not include error codes. The partition is either available or not (we return NOT_COORDINATOR in all cases anyway).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n-
