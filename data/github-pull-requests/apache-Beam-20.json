it clearer that Data and Timers aren't interacting negatively, as a cursory look made it appear that if Elements ever contained Data and Timers simultaneously, that a successful execution of timers would cause an error processing data to be swallowed.\r\n\r\nLikely a red herring though, as Data and Timers do not have the same PtransformID: Data always points to the synthetic DataSource transform, while timers are directly routed to their consuming Transform's OnTimer callback. But it's nicer to not have to remember that.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in the name of readability, the split check is also moved into the Data handling callback in DataSource.Process, so it doesn't look like a Split in bundle processing would skip any outstanding timers. Since the check relies on the targeted PTransformID and they are never the same, it shouldn't happen.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR implements feature request #31299 for Java SDK.\r\n\r\nWe also try to make the Java user-agent consistent with the Python one (see #31300) \r\nby inserting \"apache-beam/VERSION\".\r\n\r\n---\r\nSome more notes:\r\n\r\nIn Java SDK, GCSIO (from `com.google.cloud.hadoop.gcsio`) is used as an accessing layer to communicate with GCS. Internally, it depends on the storage client (from `com.google.api.services.storage`) to assemble and handle HTTP requests.  \r\n\r\nGCSIO can either create a new Google Cloud Storage client during initialization or utilize an existing one, which is the approach adopted by Beam. Ideally, it will be better if Beam can use the first code path so that we can leave all the GCS connection detail to GCSIO. \r\n\r\nFollow-up tasks\r\n\r\n- [ ] To investigate the gaps between the two code paths and find a better way for Beam so that it doesn't need to initialize its own storage client. The starting point will be [RetryHttpInitializer.java](https://github.com/GoogleCloudDataproc/hadoop-connectors/blob/f39c78fafe8fae243eab3b3c1d113912514fe73a/util/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/hadoop/util/RetryHttpInitializer.java#L43), [GoogleCloudStorageImpl.java](https://github.com/GoogleCloudDataproc/hadoop-connectors/blob/f39c78fafe8fae243eab3b3c1d113912514fe73a/gcsio/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/hadoop/gcsio/GoogleCloudStorageImpl.java#L333) from gcsio and [RetryHttpRequestInitializer.java](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/2babd0aee5b65f75e06702b30192c2aa8a24fdf9/sdks/java/extensions/google-cloud-platform-core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/gcp/util/RetryHttpRequestInitializer.java#L50), [Transport.java](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/999f7deb94e9875be85679ac0d17b331d9e36fd0/sdks/java/extensions/google-cloud-platform-core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/gcp/util/Transport.java#L94) in Beam\r\n- [ ] To implement #31299 for Go SDK.

https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/31226\r\n\r\n## Issue Summary\r\n\r\nThe `BigQueryServicesImpl` of the Apache Beam SDK does not handle the errors of \"Not Found\" and \"Permission Denied\" when inserting data into BigQuery fails. This results in a Dataflow job attempting to insert the data into BigQuery infinitely.\r\n\r\n## Detailed Description\r\n\r\n### Problem Statement\r\n\r\n- **Error Handling**: The `BigQueryServicesImpl` does not manage \"Not Found\" and \"Permission Denied\" errors.\r\n- **Infinite Retries**: If data insertion into BigQuery fails, the Dataflow job retries indefinitely.\r\n\r\n### Current Workarounds\r\n\r\n- **Fixed Destination Datasets/Tables**: Errors can be resolved by creating the dataset or table, or by granting the required permissions to the service account of the Dataflow job.\r\n- **Dynamic Destination Tables**: When destination tables are determined dynamically by the input data:\r\n  - A destination table might not exist due to incorrect input data.\r\n  - A destination table might exist, but the Dataflow job should not insert data into it due to incorrect input data.\r\n  - In these cases, creating incorrect destination tables or granting permissions to insert into them is not advisable.\r\n\r\n### Potential Solutions\r\n\r\n- **Custom `BigQueryServices`**: Modify the behavior of `BigQueryServicesImpl` by creating a custom `BigQueryServices` within the Apache Beam SDK namespace using the `withTestServices` method. However, this method is not recommended for production use due to its complexity.\r\n- **Dead-letter Topic**: Routing failed records to a dead-letter topic in Pub/Sub is not recommended.\r\n  - [Dead-letter topics in Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/streaming-with-cloud-pubsub#dead-letter-topics)\r\n- **Retry Policy**: Handling \"Not Found\" and \"Permission Denied\" errors in the pipeline with a retry policy would be ideal. Currently, `BigQueryServicesImpl` can handle errors returned by the BigQuery API.\r\n  - [BigQuery API Reference](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tabledata/insertAll)\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the BigQuery handler for Enrichment transform.\r\n\r\nTo use this handler you need either of the following combinations:\r\n1. `table_name`, `row_restriction_template`, `fields`\r\n2. `table_name`, `row_restriction_template`, `condition_value_fn`\r\n3. `query_fn`\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, batch size can be specified with `min_batch_size` and `max_batch_size`. These are passed to the `BatchElements` transform just before making calls to BigQuery. This helps reducing the cost on the BigQuery side.\r\n\r\nBy default, the handler pulls all columns from the BigQuery table. To override this, use the `column_name` parameter to specify a list of column names to fetch.\r\n\r\nThe user interface here is pretty similar to [`TableReadOptions`](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/bigquerystorage/latest/google.cloud.bigquery_storage_v1.types.ReadSession.TableReadOptions).\r\n\r\nExample Usage:\r\n```\r\nhandler = BigQueryEnrichmentHandler(\r\n        project=PROJECT_ID,\r\n        row_restriction_template=\"id='{}'\",\r\n        table_name=TABLE_NAME,\r\n        fields=['id'],\r\n        min_batch_size=2,\r\n        max_batch_size=100,\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a nit that drives my brain nuts. Also it scrolls more characters off the end of the job name so makes GitHub UI annoying.\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\n\r\n - search and replace `beam_([A-Z])` and replace with `$1`\r\n - `rename -s beam_ '' * .github/workflows/*\r\n\r\nThe chance that this breaks something random where someone regexed against the job name is pretty high, though the global search shows nothing remains. But of course some bits won't use the repo as the source of truth. And probably some grafana queries need to be old job name OR new job name, etc, etc. And probably some ill-advised fragile uses that I miss in the above obvious stuff.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

reverts commit 3b272d2c6c95fe888a03ccf100537b4149682546.\r\n\r\nThis is a pure revert, because:\r\n\r\n - Dataflow translation did not have a problem in the original #30545. It was reverted because the core transform had to be reverted due to other runners's bugs.\r\n - Dataflow v1 and v2 both execute the composites correctly already.\r\n\r\nNow the original transform is re-introduced and runners with bugs have their tests sickbayed appropriately, so we can move forward safely.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a subsuite of unit tests for ML package and run it with all known optional ML dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe suite should provide early detection signals when an ML dependency creates a new release, and we are no longer compatible with its API, but it could also create noise for us. Given that the ML dependencies are optional for Beam, we don't  set version bounds for these test dependencies. We install a lot of (direct+transitive) dependencies in the `ml_test` extra ,  and leave dependency resolution up to pip. If dependency resolution becomes messy, we will have the option to tweak the dependencies or introduce more specialized extras.\r\n\r\nCompatibility testing  between Beam with specific fine-grained versions of particular dependencies is done in a separate postcommit suite .github/workflows/beam_PostCommit_Python_Dependency.yml. \r\n\r\nMoving compat tests from 'coverage' suite reduces the time run the code coverage GHA. Tests that need extra ML deps were not included in code coverage tests previously, keeping it that way for now to reduce coverage runtime, but we can reconsider if we find this signal valuable.\r\n\r\nI exclude the `apache_beam/ml` tests from the main precommit suite, since the new suite includes the same tests + some unit tests that were skipped when optional dependencies are not installed. If this test suite becomes too unstable, we might have to add `apache_beam/ml` without extra deps back to the precommit suite.\r\n\r\nAdding this suite exposed several tests that were not running and not working properly: https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/31254, https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/31252, https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/31287, https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/31294 and reduced the 'coverage' suite run to under 30 min: https://github.com/apache/beam/actions/runs/9054795242/job/24875055178?pr=31255\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

change adds `readMessagesWithAttributesWithCoderAndParseFn` that enables forwarding of the Pubsub message attributes to make them available when applying the provided ParseFn. The new method is similar to `readMessagesWithCoderAndParseFn`, but adds `setNeedsAttributes(true)`.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nThe `readMessagesWithCoderAndParseFn` of PubsubIO skips forwarding the pubsub message attributes to the provided parse function. In the use case I am solving, the attributes of the message contain the schema fingerprint needed for the parsing.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver/releases\">go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>MongoDB Go Driver 1.15.0</h2>\n<p>The MongoDB Go Driver Team is pleased to release version 1.15.0 of the official Go driver.</p>\n<h2>Release Notes</h2>\n<p>This release adds a feature that can prevent &quot;connection churn&quot; caused by operation timeouts.</p>\n<h3>Prevent &quot;Connection Churn&quot; Caused by Timeouts</h3>\n<p>Previously, the Go Driver would close the in-use connection when an operation timed out. However, closing the in-use connection can cause significant additional application and database load if many timeouts happen quickly, potentially causing &quot;connection churn&quot; that can exacerbate latency issues. The Go Driver now offers a new feature that waits (for a maximum of 1 second) for the connection to be reusable after an operation times out instead of closing it.</p>\n<p>To enable the new feature, set a <code>Client</code>-wide timeout by using <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo/options#ClientOptions.SetTimeout\">SetTimeout</a> or by specifing the <code>timeoutMS</code> connection string option. Use <code>SetTimeout(0)</code> or <code>timeoutMS=0</code> to enable the new feature without adding new timeouts. See <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo/options#ClientOptions.SetTimeout\">SetTimeout</a> for more information about the <code>Client</code>-wide timeout configuration.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>For a full list of tickets included in this release, please see the links below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/issues/?jql=project%3Dgodriver%20and%20type%3D%22new%20feature%22%20and%20status%20%3D%20Closed%20and%20fixVersion%3D1.15.0\">New Features</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/issues/?jql=project%3Dgodriver%20and%20type%3Dimprovement%20and%20status%20%3D%20Closed%20and%20fixVersion%3D1.15.0\">Improvements</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/issues/?jql=project%3DGODRIVER%20and%20type%3DBug%20and%20status%3Dclosed%20and%20fixVersion%3D1.15.0\">Bugs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver/compare/v1.14.0...v1.15.0\">v1.14.0...1.15.0</a></p>\n<p>Documentation for the Go driver can be found on <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo?tab=doc\">pkg.go.dev</a> and the <a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/go/\">MongoDB documentation site</a>.

PR increases the upper bound to allow Pandas 2.1 and makes necessary changes to for Beam dataframe doctests pass. \r\n\r\nExpanding the list of `ELEMENTWISE_STRING_METHODS` enables support of additional dataframe operations in Beam by running them per-element: `center, decode, encode, find, index, lfind, ljust, normalize, rfind, rindex, rjust, translate`.\r\n\r\nMost of the changes exclude newly added doctests tests to Pandas 2.1, which exercise Dataframe operations that are not \r\n supported in Beam, such as order-sensitive operations operations that are not applicable to a distributed, unordered deferred dataframe.\r\n\r\nExcluded tests don't appear to be regressions in Pandas 2.1, they were also not supported in Pandas 1.x.\r\n\r\nThe PR also adds a capability to skip an example from all tests that include it, so that we don't need to exclude the same (unsupported) example multiple times in several tests.\r\n\r\nRemaining issue: include a compat tests suite for Pandas 2.1. This is deferred, since current compat test suite uses Python 3.8, for which Pandas 2.1 is not available. In short term, Pandas 2.1 will be on tests against master. We should add a compat test suite for Pandas 2.1 before switching to Pandas 2.2.\r\n\r\nfixes: https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/31198\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
