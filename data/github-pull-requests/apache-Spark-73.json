Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nChange default value of `spark.sql.maxSinglePartitionBytes` from `Long.maxValue` to `128m`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`spark.sql.maxSinglePartitionBytes` was introduced in SPARK-41986(https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39512), and the default value was set to `Long. MaxValue` for the safety.\r\n\r\nRecently, we hit the same issue described in the SPARK-41986, and setting it to `128m`(the original proposed default value) works fine in our internal cluster.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the migration guide was updated correspondingly.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPass GA.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to simplify the log when Spark HybridStore hits the memory limit.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`HistoryServerMemoryManager.lease` throws `RuntimeException`s frequently when the current usage is high.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d382c6b3aef28bde6adcdf62b7be565ff1152942/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/HistoryServerMemoryManager.scala#L52-L55\r\n\r\nIn this case, although Apache Spark shows `RuntimeException` as `INFO` level log, HybridStore works fine by fallback to disk store. So, there is no need to surprise the users with `RuntimeException` in the log. After this PR, we will provide a simpler message with the all messages without StrackTrace and `RuntimeException`.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```\r\n23/08/23 22:40:34 INFO FsHistoryProvider: Failed to create HybridStore for spark-xxx/None.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix `RELEASE` file to have the correct information in Docker images if `RELEASE` file exists.\r\n\r\nPlease note that `RELEASE` file doesn't exists in SPARK_HOME directory when we run the K8s integration test from Spark Git repository. So, we keep the following empty `RELEASE` file generation and use `COPY` conditionally via glob syntax.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/2a3aec1f9040e08999a2df88f92340cd2710e552/resource-managers/kubernetes/docker/src/main/dockerfiles/spark/Dockerfile#L37\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, it's an empty file in the official Apache Spark Docker images.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ docker run -it --rm apache/spark:latest ls -al /opt/spark/RELEASE\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 spark spark 0 Jun 25 03:13 /opt/spark/RELEASE\r\n\r\n$ docker run -it --rm apache/spark:v3.1.3 ls -al /opt/spark/RELEASE | tail -n1\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Feb 21  2022 /opt/spark/RELEASE\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually build image and check it with `docker run -it --rm NEW_IMAGE ls -al /opt/spark/RELEASE`\r\n\r\nI copied this `Dockerfile` into Apache Spark 3.5.0 RC2 binary distribution and tested in the following way.\r\n```\r\n$ cd spark-3.5.0-rc2-bin-hadoop3\r\n\r\n$ cp /tmp/Dockerfile kubernetes/dockerfiles/spark/Dockerfile\r\n\r\n$ bin/docker-image-tool.sh -t SPARK-44935 build\r\n\r\n$ docker run -it --rm docker.io/library/spark:SPARK-44935 ls -al /opt/spark/RELEASE | tail -n1\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 165 Aug 18 21:10 /opt/spark/RELEASE\r\n\r\n$ docker run -it --rm docker.io/library/spark:SPARK-44935 cat /opt/spark/RELEASE | tail -n2\r\nSpark 3.5.0 (git revision 010c4a6a05) built for Hadoop 3.3.4\r\nBuild flags: -B -Pmesos -Pyarn -Pkubernetes -Psparkr -Pscala-2.12 -Phadoop-3 -Phive -Phive-thriftserver\r\n```\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOriginally, when a CTE has duplicate expression IDs in its output, the rule PushdownPredicatesAndPruneColumnsForCTEDef wrongly assesses that the columns in the CTE were pruned, as it compares the size of the attribute set containing the union of columns (which is unique) and the original output of the CTE (which contains duplicate columns) and notices that the former is less than the latter. This causes incorrect pruning of the CTE output, resulting in a missing reference and causing the error as documented in the ticket.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the logic to use the needsPruning function to assess whether a CTE has been pruned, which uses the outputSet to check if any columns has been pruned instead of the output.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe incorrect behaviour of PushdownPredicatesAndPruneColumnsForCTEDef in CTEs with duplicate expression IDs in its output causes a crash when such a query is run.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test for the crashing case was added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pull request adds Encoders.bean support for beans having a superclass declared with generic type arguments. \r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass JavaBeanWithGenericsA<T> {\r\n    public T getPropertyA() {\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setPropertyA(T a) {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass JavaBeanWithGenericBase extends JavaBeanWithGenericsA<String> {\r\n}\r\n\r\nEncoders.bean(JavaBeanWithGenericBase.class); // Exception\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat feature had to be part of [PR 42327](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/1f5d78b5952fcc6c7d36d3338a5594070e3a62dd) but was missing as I was focusing on nested beans only (@hvanhovell )\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nJavaTypeInference.encoderFor did not solve TypeVariable objects for superclasses so when managing a case like in the example above an exception was thrown.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests have been extended, new specific tests have been added\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Just convert the lower redundant `Aggregate` to `Project`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe aggregate contains complex grouping expressions after `RemoveRedundantAggregates`, if `aggregateExpressions` has (if / case) branches, it is possible that `groupingExpressions` is no longer a subexpression of `aggregateExpressions` after execute `PushFoldableIntoBranches` rule, Then cause `boundReference` error.\r\nFor example\r\n```\r\nSELECT c * 2 AS d\r\nFROM (\r\n         SELECT if(b > 1, 1, b) AS c\r\n         FROM (\r\n                  SELECT if(a < 0, 0, a) AS b\r\n                  FROM VALUES (-1), (1), (2) AS t1(a)\r\n              ) t2\r\n         GROUP BY b\r\n     ) t3\r\nGROUP BY c\r\n```\r\nBefore pr\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nAggregate [if ((b#0

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to re-use the `Hex`, `Base64` and `Decode` expressions in the `ToCharacter` (the `to_char`/`to_varchar` functions) when the `format` parameter is one of `hex`, `base64` and `utf-8`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make the migration to Spark SQL easier from the systems like:\r\n- Snowflake: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/to_char\r\n- SAP SQL Anywhere: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_SQL_Anywhere/93079d4ba8e44920ae63ffb4def91f5b/81fe51196ce21014b9c6cf43b2666698.html\r\n- Oracle:

https://www.vertica.com/docs/9.3.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/SQLReferenceManual/Functions/Formatting/TO_CHAR.htm\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. This PR extends existing API. It might be considered as an user-facing change only if user's code depends on errors in the case of wrong formats.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new examples:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.ExpressionInfoSuite\"\r\n```\r\nand new tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *.StringFunctionsSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch fixes an issue with the serialization of the Spark Connect proto messages during the event notifications. \r\n\r\nWithout this patch upon

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes the alias name `sf` instead of `F` for `pyspark.sql.functions` alias in public documentation:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as sf\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR does not change the internal or test codes as it's too invasive, and might easily cause conflicts.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\r\n```\r\n\r\nisn’t very Pythonic - it does not follow PEP 8, see [Package and Module Names](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names).\r\n\r\n> Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves\r\n> readability. Python packages should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores\r\n> is discouraged.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the module’s alias should follow this. In practice, the uppercase is only used at the module/package\r\nlevel constants in my experience, see also [Constants](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#constants).\r\n\r\nSee also [this stackoverflow comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70458086/how-to-correctly-import-pyspark-sql-functions#comment129714058_70458115).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it changes documentation so users \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually checked.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-08-23T08:54:03Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:51:56Z","closed_at":"2023-08-24T03:35:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f3d1172457c4cdc10a4d0a2fd001b695bec619a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR set a character length limit for the error message and a stack depth limit for error stack traces to the console appender in tests.\r\n\r\nThe original patterns are\r\n\r\n- %d{yy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss} %p %c{1}: %m%n%ex\r\n- %t: %m%n%ex\r\n\r\nAnd they're adjusted to the new consistent pattern\r\n\r\n- `%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} %p %c: %maxLen{%m}{512}%n%ex{8}%n`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn testing, intentional and unintentional failures are created to generate extensive log volumes. For instance, a single FileNotFound error may be logged multiple times in the writer, task runner, task set manager, and other areas, resulting in thousands of lines per failure. \r\n\r\nFor example, tests in ParquetRebaseDatetimeSuite will be run with V1 and V2 Datasource, two or more specific values, and multiple configuration pairs. I have seen the SparkUpgradeException all over the CI logs\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"sql/testOnly *ParquetRebaseDatetimeV1Suite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n15:59:55.446 ERROR

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe SPARK-44802 now allows for token authentication when resolving Jira issues in pull request merging. However, the token auth is kinda lazy during the initial handshake, maintainers might get confused someday.\r\n\r\nThis pull request promptly calls the current_user() function to initiate authentication and provides clear instructions for token expiration.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nlocally verified the code snippet\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to stop materializing `OAuth token` from the default service token file, `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`, because the content of volumes varies which means being renewed or expired by K8s control plane. We need to read the content in a on-demand manner to be in the up-to-date status.\r\n\r\nNote the followings:\r\n\r\n- Since we use `autoConfigure` for K8s client, K8s client still uses the default service tokens if exists and needed.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/13588c10cbc380ecba1231223425eaad2eb9ec80/resource-managers/kubernetes/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/k8s/SparkKubernetesClientFactory.scala#L91\r\n\r\n- This PR doesn't change Spark's behavior for the user-provided token file location. Spark will load the content of the user-provided token file locations to get `OAuth token` because Spark cannot assume that the files of that locations are refreshed or not in the future.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n[BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/service-accounts-admin/#bound-service-account-token-volume) became `Stable` at K8s 1.22.\r\n\r\n- [KEP-1205 Bound Service Account Tokens](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-auth/1205-bound-service-account-tokens/README.md#boundserviceaccounttokenvolume-1) : **BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume**\r\n\r\nAlpha | Beta | GA\r\n-- | -- | --\r\n1.13 | 1.21 | 1.22\r\n\r\n- [EKS Service Account with 90 Days Expiration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/service-accounts.html)\r\n  > For Amazon EKS clusters, the extended expiry period is 90 days. Your Amazon EKS cluster's Kubernetes API server rejects requests with tokens that are greater than 90 days old.\r\n\r\n- As of today, [all supported EKS clusters are from 1.23 to 1.27](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html) which means we always use `BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This fixes only the bugs caused by some outdated tokens where K8s control plane denies Spark's K8s API invocation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with the all existing unit tests and integration tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change adds configuration options for the streaming input File Source for `maxCachedFiles` and `discardCachedFilesRatio`.  These values were originally introduced with https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27620 but were hardcoded to 10,000 and 0.2, respectively.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUnder certain workloads with large `maxFilesPerTrigger` settings, the performance gain from caching the input files capped at 10,000 can cause a cluster to be underutilized and jobs to take longer to finish if each batch takes a while to finish.  For example, a job with `maxFilesPerTrigger` set to 100,000 would do all 100k in batch 1, then only 10k in batch 2, but both batches could take just as long since some of the files cause skewed processing times.  This results in a cluster spending nearly the same amount of time while processing only 1/10 of the files it could have.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUpdated documentation for structured streaming sources to describe new configurations options\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew and existing unit tests. \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-23T03:00:06Z","updated_at":"2024-02-26T00:18:43Z","closed_at":"2024-02-26T00:18:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"03da2300c6e37aec00d602c1356c2f4f860a577a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41785 / SPARK-44241 introduced a new `awaitUninterruptibly()` call in one branch of `TrasportClientFactory.createClient()` (executed when the connection create timeout is non-positive). This PR replaces that call with an interruptible `await()` call.\r\n\r\nNote that the other pre-existing branches in this method were already using `await()`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUninterruptible waiting can cause problems when cancelling tasks. For details, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16866 / SPARK-19529, an older PR fixing a similar issue in this same `TransportClientFactory.createClient()` method.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-23T00:49:02Z","updated_at":"2023-08-23T05:56:42Z","closed_at":"2023-08-23T05:54:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"39510f2ebbdf7137b7af4cd9c818b625094f92ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42619/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42619/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42619/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/80853b7d446d97310e4d84d74c5e34d680772e4f","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:remove-awaitUninterruptibly","ref":"remove-awaitUninterruptibly","sha":"80853b7d446d97310e4d84d74c5e34d680772e4f","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new behavior guarded by a new config that changes how a Avro union of a single primitive type is converted to Spark types..\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSpark Avro data source schema converter currently converts union with a single primitive type to a Spark primitive type instead of a StructType.\r\n\r\nWhile for more complex union types that consists of multiple primitive types, the schema converter translate them into StructTypes.\r\n\r\nFor example, \r\n```\r\nimport scala.collection.JavaConverters._\r\nimport org.apache.avro._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.avro._\r\n\r\n// [\"string\", \"null\"]\r\nSchemaConverters.toSqlType(\r\nSchema.createUnion(Seq(Schema.create(Schema.Type.STRING), Schema.create(Schema.Type.NULL)).asJava)\r\n).dataType\r\n\r\n// [\"string\", \"int\", \"null\"]\r\nSchemaConverters.toSqlType(\r\nSchema.createUnion(Seq(Schema.create(Schema.Type.STRING), Schema.create(Schema.Type.INT), Schema.create(Schema.Type.NULL)).asJava)\r\n).dataType\r\n```\r\nThe first one would return StringType, the second would return StructType(StringType, IntegerType).\r\n \r\nIt is undesirable in some cases as we may want to consistently get StructType out of Avro union. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, a new config `spark.sql.avro.alwaysConvertUnionToStructType` that can be used to define how an Avro union of a single type is converted into Spark types.\r\nThe default behavior stays the same.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to make the `array_insert` function 1-based for negative indexes. So, the maximum index is -1 should point out to the last element, and the function should insert new element at the end of the given array for the index -1.\r\n\r\nThe old behaviour can be restored via the SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.negativeIndexInArrayInsert`.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42564\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1.  To match the behaviour of functions such as `substr()` and `element_at()`.\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> select element_at(array('a', 'b'), -1), substr('ab', -1);\r\nb\tb\r\n```\r\n2. To fix an inconsistency in `array_insert` in which positive indexes are 1-based, but negative indexes are 0-based.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> select array_insert(array('a', 'b'), -1, 'c');\r\n[\"a\",\"c\",\"b\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> select array_insert(array('a', 'b'), -1, 'c');\r\n[\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *CollectionExpressionsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DataFrameFunctionsSuite\"\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2023-08-22T18:09:44Z","updated_at":"2023-08-23T04:43:44Z","closed_at":"2023-08-23T04:43:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b1ba19640c559c934a76350775cf3d119e056a8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42616/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42616/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42616/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8f7a68d7aa4fb6675956c8b269fce59c1ff57031","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-array_insert-3.5-2","ref":"fix-array_insert-3.5-2","sha":"8f7a68d7aa4fb6675956c8b269fce59c1ff57031","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRight now we only support pushing down the V2 UDF that has not a magic method. Because the V2 UDF will be analyzed into the `ApplyFunctionExpression` which could be translated and pushed down. However, a V2 UDF that has the magic method will be analyzed into `StaticInvoke` or `Invoke` that can not be translated into V2 expression and then can not be pushed down to the data source. The magic method is suggested. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the support of pushing down the V2 UDF that has a magic method.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, now the V2 UDF with the magic method could be pushed down.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNew UTs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes `percentile_disc()` function as currently it returns inforrect results in some cases. E.g.:\r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\n  percentile_disc(0.0) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p0,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.1) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p1,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.2) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p2,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.3) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p3,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.4) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p4,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p5,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.6) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p6,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.7) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p7,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.8) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p8,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.9) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p9,\r\n  percentile_disc(1.0) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p10\r\nFROM VALUES (0), (1), (2), (3), (4) AS v(a)\r\n```\r\ncurrently returns:\r\n```\r\n+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n| p0| p1| p2| p3| p4| p5| p6| p7| p8| p9|p10|\r\n+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|2.0|2.0|2.0|3.0|3.0|4.0|\r\n+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n```\r\nbut after this PR it returns the correct:\r\n```\r\n+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n| p0| p1| p2| p3| p4| p5| p6| p7| p8| p9|p10|\r\n+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|2.0|2.0|3.0|3.0|4.0|4.0|\r\n+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBugfix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, fixes a correctness bug, but the old behaviour can be restored with `spark.sql.legacy.percentileDiscCalculation=true`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes `percentile_disc()` function as currently it returns inforrect results in some cases. E.g.:\r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\n  percentile_disc(0.0) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p0,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.1) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p1,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.2) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p2,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.3) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p3,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.4) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p4,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p5,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.6) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p6,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.7) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p7,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.8) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p8,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.9) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p9,\r\n  percentile_disc(1.0) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p10\r\nFROM VALUES (0), (1), (2), (3), (4) AS v(a)\r\n```\r\ncurrently returns:\r\n```\r\n+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n| p0| p1| p2| p3| p4| p5| p6| p7| p8| p9|p10|\r\n+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|2.0|2.0|2.0|3.0|3.0|4.0|\r\n+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n```\r\nbut after this PR it returns the correct:\r\n```\r\n+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n| p0| p1| p2| p3| p4| p5| p6| p7| p8| p9|p10|\r\n+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|2.0|2.0|3.0|3.0|4.0|4.0|\r\n+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBugfix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, fixes a correctness bug, but the old behaviour can be restored with `spark.sql.legacy.percentileDiscCalculation=true`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an API in the Python UDTF 'analyze' method to require partitioning/ordering properties from the input relation. Catalyst then performs necessary repartitioning and/or sorting as needed to fulfill the requested properties.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following property would request for Catalyst to behave as if the UDTF call included `PARTITION BY partition_col ORDER BY input`: \r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import AnalyzeResult, OrderingColumn, PartitioningColumn\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import IntegerType, StructType\r\n\r\n@udtf\r\nclass MyUDTF:\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def analyze(self):\r\n        return AnalyzeResult(\r\n            schema=StructType()\r\n                .add(\"partition_col\", IntegerType())\r\n                .add(\"count\", IntegerType())\r\n                .add(\"total\", IntegerType())\r\n                .add(\"last\", IntegerType()),\r\n            partition_by=[\r\n                PartitioningColumn(\"partition_col\")\r\n            ],\r\n            order_by=[\r\n                OrderingColumn(\"input\")\r\n            ])\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, the following property would request for Catalyst to behave as if the UDTF call included `WITH SINGLE PARTITION`: \r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import AnalyzeResult\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import IntegerType, StructType\r\n\r\n@udtf\r\nclass MyUDTF:\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def analyze(self):\r\n        return AnalyzeResult(\r\n            schema=StructType()\r\n                .add(\"partition_col\", IntegerType())\r\n                .add(\"count\", IntegerType())\r\n                .add(\"total\", IntegerType())\r\n                .add(\"last\", IntegerType()),\r\n            with_single_partition=True)\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis gives Python UDTF authors the ability to write table functions that can assume constraints about which rows are consumed by which instances of the UDTF class.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds unit test coverage in Scala and Python.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo","created_at":"2023-08-21T23:52:09Z","updated_at":"2023-09-02T00:21:06Z","closed_at":"2023-09-02T00:21:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"55b27292b869ee32f04119295ccd3b22c820faed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42595/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42595/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42595/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/29a24a8420ccd435c81d135d5d8604025b5cc6a9","head":{"label":"dtenedor:anlayze-result","ref":"anlayze-result","sha":"29a24a8420ccd435c81d135d5d8604025b5cc6a9","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":592933002,"node_id":"R_kgDOI1dwig","name":"spark","full_name":"dtenedor/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR makes a bunch of changes to connect testing for the scala client:\r\n- We do not start the connect server with the `SPARK_DIST_CLASSPATH ` environment variable. This is set by the build system, but its value for SBT and Maven is different. For SBT it also contained the client code.\r\n- We use dependency upload to add the dependencies needed for the tests. Currently this entails: the compiled test classes (class files), scalatest jars, and scalactic jars.\r\n- The use of classfile sync unearthed an issue with stubbing and the `ExecutorClassLoader`. If they load classes in the same namespace then stubbing will generate stubs for classes that can be loaded by the `ExecutorClassLoader`. Since this is mostly a testing issue I decided to move the test code to a different namespace. We should definitely fix this later on.\r\n- A bunch of tiny fixes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSBT testing for connect leaked client side code into the server. This is a problem because tests pass and we sign-off on features that do not work when well in a normal environment. Stubbing was an example of this. Maven did not have this problem and was therefore more correct.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nIt are mostly tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo. I write my own code thank you...","created_at":"2023-08-21T20:50:54Z","updated_at":"2023-08-27T03:29:53Z","closed_at":"2023-08-27T03:29:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a6b807cf1c1685f3d658da48e821261279800ccf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32748 previously proposed propagating these local properties to the subquery broadcast exec threads but was then reverted since it was said that local properties would already be propagated to the broadcast threads.\r\nI believe this is not always true. In the scenario where a separate `BroadcastExchangeExec` is the first to compute the broadcast, this is fine. However, in the scenario where the `SubqueryBroadcastExec` is the first to compute the broadcast, then the local properties that are propagated to the broadcast threads would not have been propagated correctly. This is because the local properties from the subquery broadcast exec were not propagated to its Future thread.\r\nIt is difficult to write a unit test that reproduces this behavior because usually `BroadcastExchangeExec` is the first computing the broadcast variable. However, by adding a `Thread.sleep(10)` to `SubqueryBroadcastExec.doPrepare` after `relationFuture` is initialized, the added test will consistently fail. \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix docstring of `monotonically_increasing_id`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1, using `from pyspark.sql import functions as F` to avoid implicit wildcard import;\r\n2, using dataframe APIs instead of RDD, so the docstring can be reused in Connect;\r\n\r\nafter this fix, all dostrings are reused between vanilla PySpark and Spark

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-44507(https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42130) updated `try_arithmetic.sql.out` and `numeric.sql.out`, SPARK-44868(https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42534) updated `datetime-formatting.sql.out`, but these PRs didn’t pay attention to the test health on Java 21. So this PR has regenerated the golden files `try_arithmetic.sql.out.java21`, `numeric.sql.out.java21`, and `datetime-formatting.sql.out.java21` of `SQLQueryTestSuite` so that `SQLQueryTestSuite` can be tested with Java 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRestore `SQLQueryTestSuite` to be tested with Java 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix wildcard import `from pyspark.sql.functions import *` in https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nto follow the [PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)\r\n\r\n> Wildcard imports (from <module> import *) should be avoided, as they make it unclear which names are present in the namespace, confusing both readers and many automated tools. There is one defensible use case for a wildcard import, which is to republish an internal interface as part of a public API (for example, overwriting a pure Python implementation of an interface with the definitions from an optional accelerator module and exactly which definitions will be overwritten isn’t known in advance).\r\nWhen republishing names this way, the guidelines below regarding public and internal interfaces still apply.\r\n\r\nto avoid potential namespace conflicts, since there are several sql functions already shared the same names with built-in modules/functions (e.g. `min`/`max`/`sum`/`hash`)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nyes\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCI\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis proposes to introduce `CLUSTER BY` SQL clause to CREATE/REPLACE SQL syntax:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE tbl(a int, b string) CLUSTER BY (a, b)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis doesn't introduce a default implementation for clustering, but it's up to the catalog/datasource implementation to utilize the clustering information (e.g., Delta, Iceberg, etc.).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo introduce the concept of clustering to datasources.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, this introduces a new SQL keyword.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded extensive unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

[built-in function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR is to avoid namespace conflict which may break existing workloads, e.g.\r\n```\r\nimport uuid\r\nfrom

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nNo.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid executor stucks.\r\nThe reason why executor stucked is because in `RetryingBlockTransferor#initiateRetry`\r\nfailed to create native thread when execute code `executorService.submit`.But the \r\nmember `currentListener` in `RetryingBlockTransferor` has changed before the retry\r\nsubmit. But the Exception occurred in the old `currentListener`. But in `RetryingBlockTransferor.RetryingBlockTransferListener#handleBlockTransferFailure` will\r\njudge `this == currentListener` , but `this` is the old one , so `this` not equals `currentListener`.\r\nThe `RetryingBlockTransferListener` can not forward the failure to `BlockFetchingListener` in\r\n`ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator`. And `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` can not get data from `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator#results`.\r\nThen it happened.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy  orginal spark unit tests.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdds support for using the YARN application master failure validity interval for determining whether an attempt is the last attempt during shutdown. During the application master shutdown hook, if the validity interval is specified, we get previous attempt information from the resource manager to make a best attempt at mirroring whether YARN is going to retry the application or not. This is because, AFAIK, there is no way for Spark to know 100% if YARN will retry the application or not. \r\n\r\nThis can lead to two scenarios where Spark is wrong about whether YARN will retry it or not:\r\n- Spark thinks it is the last attempt but YARN will retry the application. This is what can already happen by not respecting the failure validity at all.\r\n- Spark thinks the application will retry but YARN thinks it was the last attempt. This will result in the staging directory not be cleaned up, but that can already happen if Spark gets killed during the last attempt and doesn't run it's shutdown hooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSpark supports passing the AM application validity interval to YARN using the `spark.yarn.am.attemptFailuresValidityInterval` setting, but then ignores this during shutdown when determining whether it's the last attempt and whether to cleanup the staging directory. Currently if you try to use this setting, YARN will respect the setting and attempt to retry the application, but only if the last attempt was killed with a hard shutdown (like OOM) that prevents the shutdown logic from occurring. During a graceful shutdown, Spark will delete the staging directory and unregister the application from YARN, preventing any further attempts.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, Spark on YARN better supports graceful recovery and retry of jobs to better enable long running Spark Streaming jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew UT. It unfortunately relies on sleeping to test the validity timing, which seems very prone to flakiness, but I couldn't think of any other way to test it. If the approach seems sound, it might be worth just removing the test. I don't see any tests for simply the max YARN attempts.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDisable strict limit for RocksDB write manager to avoid insertion exception on cache full\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn some cases, if the memory limit is reached, on insert/get, we are seeing the following exception\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 42 in stage 9.0 failed 4 times, most recent failure: Lost task 42.3 in stage 9.0 (TID 2950) (96.104.176.55 executor 0): org.rocksdb.RocksDBException: Insert failed due to LRU cache being full.\r\n\tat

org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.state.RocksDBStateStoreProvider$RocksDBStateStore.get(RocksDBStateStoreProvider.scala:55)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems this is being thrown with strict memory limit within RocksDB here - https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/0fa0c97d3e9ac5dfc2e7ae94834b0850cdef5df7/cache/lru_cache.cc#L394\r\n\r\nIt seems this issue can only happen with the strict mode as described here - https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/5048#issuecomment-470788792\r\n\r\nSeems like there is a pending issue for RocksDB around this as well - https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/8670\r\n\r\nThere is probably a relevant fix, but not sure whether this addresses the issue completely - https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/6619\r\n(cc - @siying )\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-18T20:09:44Z","updated_at":"2023-08-23T04:13:27Z","closed_at":"2023-08-23T04:13:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"225aaa9481e45b906a453f27a621db7eb18f238e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to make the `array_insert` function 1-based for negative indexes. So, the maximum index is -1 should point out to the last element, and the function should insert new element at the end of the given array for the index -1.\r\n\r\nThe old behaviour can be restored via the SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.negativeIndexInArrayInsert`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1.  To match the behaviour of functions such as `substr()` and `element_at()`.\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> select element_at(array('a', 'b'), -1), substr('ab', -1);\r\nb\tb\r\n```\r\n2. To fix an inconsistency in `array_insert` in which positive indexes are 1-based, but negative indexes are 0-based.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> select array_insert(array('a', 'b'), -1, 'c');\r\n[\"a\",\"c\",\"b\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> select array_insert(array('a', 'b'), -1, 'c');\r\n[\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *CollectionExpressionsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DataFrameFunctionsSuite\"\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd `SparkConnectServerTest` with infra to test real server with real client in the same process, but communicating over RPC.\r\n\r\nAdd `ReattachableExecuteSuite` with some tests for reattachable execute.\r\n\r\nTwo bugs were found by the tests:\r\n* Fix bug in `SparkConnectExecutionManager.createExecuteHolder` when attempting to resubmit an operation that was deemed abandoned. This bug is benign in reattachable execute, because reattachable execute would first send a ReattachExecute, which would be handled correctly in SparkConnectReattachExecuteHandler. For non-reattachable execute (disabled or old client), this is also a very unlikely scenario, because the retrying mechanism should be able to resubmit before the query is declared abandoned, and hence get an INVALID_HANDLE.OPERATION_ALREADY_EXISTS. This bug can manifest only if a non-reattachable execution is retried with so much delay that the operation was declared abandoned.\r\n* In `ExecuteGrpcResponseSender` there was an assertion that assumed that if `sendResponse` did not send, it was because deadline was reached. But it can also be because of interrupt. This would have resulted in interrupt returning an assertion error instead of CURSOR_DISCONNECTED in testing. Outside of testing assertions are not enabled, so this was not a problem outside of testing.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTesting of reattachable execute.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTests

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes `percentile_disc()` function as currently it returns inforrect results in some cases. E.g.:\r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\n  percentile_disc(0.0) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p0,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.1) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p1,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.2) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p2,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.3) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p3,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.4) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p4,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p5,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.6) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p6,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.7) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p7,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.8) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p8,\r\n  percentile_disc(0.9) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p9,\r\n  percentile_disc(1.0) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY a) as p10\r\nFROM VALUES (0), (1), (2), (3), (4) AS v(a)\r\n```\r\ncurrently returns:\r\n```\r\n+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n| p0| p1| p2| p3| p4| p5| p6| p7| p8| p9|p10|\r\n+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|2.0|2.0|2.0|3.0|3.0|4.0|\r\n+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n```\r\nbut after this PR it returns the correct:\r\n```\r\n+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n| p0| p1| p2| p3| p4| p5| p6| p7| p8| p9|p10|\r\n+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|2.0|2.0|3.0|3.0|4.0|4.0|\r\n+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBugfix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, fixes a correctness bug, but the old behaviour can be restored with `spark.sql.legacy.percentileDiscCalculation=true`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n When we try to convert a HashAggregate to SortAggregate in rule ReplaceHashWithSortAgg, add a new function `SortOrder.satisfiesExpressions(orderings: Seq[SortOrder], groupExpressions: Seq[Expression])` to determine if the child output ordering satisfies the grouping expressions.\r\n\r\nexample query 1 : \r\n```sql\r\nSELECT a, b, count(1)\r\nFROM values(1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 2) t1(a, b, c)\r\nJOIN values(1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 2) t2(d, e, f)\r\nON a = d\r\nAND b = e\r\nGROUP by b, a\r\n```\r\nThe grouping expressions are b, a, and the child output orderings are a.asc, b.asc, SortOrder.satisfiesExpressions() is true.\r\n\r\nexample query 2 : \r\n```sql\r\nSELECT a, b, count(1)\r\nFROM values(1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 2) t1(a, b, c)\r\nJOIN values(1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 2) t2(d, e, f)\r\nON a = d\r\nAND b = e\r\nGROUP by a, b, d\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe grouping expressions are a, b, d, and the child output orderings are a.asc, b.asc, but we still can find d in a.asc.children, so SortOrder.satisfiesExpressions() is true..\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nConvert more HashAggregate to SortAggregate to improve aggregate performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

is 3.5x port of #42460 in master. It resolves couple of conflicts. ]\r\n\r\nThis terminates Python worker created for `foreachBatch` when the streaming query terminate. All of the tracking is done inside connect server (inside `StreamingForeachBatchHelper`). How this works:\r\n\r\n* (A) The helper class returns a cleaner (an `AutoCloseable`) to connect server when foreachBatch function is set up (happens before starting the query).\r\n* (B) If the query fails to start, server directly invokes the cleaner.\r\n* (C) If the query starts up, the server registers the cleaner with `streamingRunnerCleanerCache` in the `SessionHolder`.\r\n* (D) The cache keeps a mapping of query to cleaner.\r\n* It registers a streaming listener (only once per session), which invokes the cleaner when a query terminates.\r\n* There is also finally cleanup when SessionHolder expires.\r\n\r\nThis ensures Python process created for a streaming query is properly terminated when a query terminates.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Unit tests are added for `CleanerCache`\r\n- Existing unit tests for foreachBatch.\r\n- Manual test to verify python process is terminated in different cases.\r\n- Unit tests don't really verify that the process is terminated.
