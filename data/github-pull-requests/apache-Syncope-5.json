Entra uses self-issued access tokens, e.g. for SCIM provisioning requests, to authenticate on external systems. To authorise these requests in Syncope, they must be verified against public keys published by Microsoft in a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a `MSEntraAccessTokenJWSVerifier` implementation, which loads a JWKS provided by Microsoft from the corresponding endpoint, caches the public keys for the recommended duration and refetches them afterwards. The `MSEntraJWTSSOProvider` implementation allows to verify and authorize requests coming from Microsoft Entra based on the JSON Web Token (JWT) sent along in the request
