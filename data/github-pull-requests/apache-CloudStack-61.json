CLOUDSTACK-8816 introduced a regression that removed the first class entities in the event bus description property. This is because everything was changed to use the Class as a key... Everything but the populateFirstClassEntities method in ActionEventUtils.\n\nThis commit tries to load the class key instead of the String key, which re-enables the populateFirstClassEntities method.\n\nLikely this was not caught because of the trace exception handling... maybe some better logging/unit tests would be good for this

motion of vm across clusters/xenserver-pools fails in a\nclustered management server setup. In xen storage motion we have to send\na migrate_receive command to the destination host, followed by\nmigrate_send command to the source host. The sr and network detials of\nthe destination host have to be passed in migrate_send command on the\nsource. While migrating across clusters the source and destination\nresources are seperate objects. To pass this information across\nresources we have to send seperate migrate with storage receive and send\ncommands to the resource. In a clustered ms setup these commands may\nhave to be forwarded to another ms as the resource may be owned by it.\nThe serilization of the command and answer objects fails in such case as\nit doesn't understand the xapi sr and network objects.

PR removes the unused shell scripts that were present in the ACS project. Those script were replaced by the.\n\nSome of the scripts are used by the HyperV Resource, which were hardcoded. I took the opportunity to use the Java constants over there as well, so the next one touching the code will know they exist and won't hardcode anything.\n\nThe following task were applied:\n- Remove the shell files and the Java constants that were mapping them;\n- Apply the use of the Java constants to the HyperV Resource class;\n- Wrap the String.format() method in the StringUtils so we can test the changes in the HyperV Resource class.\n\nThe last point was added because I do not have a HyperV test environment. Hence, I wanted to make sure the tiny code I changed is covered at least by unit

S3 implementation is far from finished, this commit focuses on the bases.\n- Upgrade AWS SDK to latest version.\n- Rewrite S3 Template downloader.\n- Rewrite S3Utils utility class.\n- Improve addImageStoreS3 API command.\n- Split various classes for convenience.\n- Various minor improvements and code optimizations.\n\nA side effect of the new AWS SDK is that it, by default, uses the V4 signature. Therefore I added an option to specify the Signer, so it stays compatible with previous versions.\n\nPlease review thoroughly, both code inspection and (automated) integration tests. Currently no integration tests are available specifically for S3. Therefore the implementation is needed to be tested manually, for now...\n\nWhat I tested:\n- Greenfield install -> will download latest systemvm template automatically to S3.\n- Upload a template/iso\n- Download a template/iso\n- Restart of management server -> list available templates -> doesn't download them again if available.\n","created_at":"2015-11-18T00:08:25Z","updated_at":"2015-12-12T01:29:13Z","closed_at":"2015-11-20T21:28:23Z","merged_at":"2015-11-20T21:28:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"9b67bfc61e13857ef384d7d6b7a2abd2c14f67a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1083/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1083/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1083/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/5c0366c99e60a1c2e3d4d03045026fce55165be1","head":{"label":"borisroman:CLOUDSTACK-9062","ref":"CLOUDSTACK-9062","sha":"5c0366c99e60a1c2e3d4d03045026fce55165be1","user":{"login":"borisroman","id":5996146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTYxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5996146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman","html_url":"https://github.com/borisroman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39012701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTAxMjcwMQ==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"borisroman/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"borisroman","id":5996146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTYxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5996146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman","html_url":"https://github.com/borisroman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisroman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/borisroman/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

PR fixes the problems we were facing with the Redundant VPC Routers. The following changes have been applied:\n- Add test to cover the rVPC routers stop/start/reboot scenario\n  - Stop/reboot master router should make the backup router become master\n  - Start the stopped router should make it become the backup router\n- Make sure the Backup router can talk to the Master router after a stop/start/reboot\n  - Stop KeepaliveD/ConntrackD if the eth2 (guest) interface is not configured and UP\n  - Only setup the redundancy after all the router configuration is done\n  - Open the FW for the VRRP communitation\n    - 224.0.0.18 and 225.0.0.50\n  - Set keepalived.conf.templ by default to use interface eth2 (guest)\n    - It will be reconfigured anyway, but having eth2 there is more clear\n","created_at":"2015-11-12T21:42:07Z","updated_at":"2015-11-16T09:52:12Z","closed_at":"2015-11-16T09:52:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a6c1b6112e7af198e42dd1ab0bfcb8915bc88185","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1064/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1064/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1064/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/952d9a84d23b3070b1073ed8ea53275de1c556e1","head":{"label":"artificially-ai:fix/rVPC-CLOUDSTACK-9015","ref":"fix/rVPC-CLOUDSTACK-9015","sha":"952d9a84d23b3070b1073ed8ea53275de1c556e1","user":{"login":"artificially-ai","id":4188903,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQxODg5MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4188903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai","html_url":"https://github.com/artificially-ai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"e1cc673ead3770ceff2f33a7480f4e02aa15a338","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache
