issue resolved #1477\r\n\r\nThe API changes to AsyncParser are intended to be completely backwards-compatible.\r\nI added a couple of additional tests that check the count of JVM threads and consumed bytes.\r\n\r\nOverall the PR is ready for feedback such as whether the proposed changes are acceptable in the first place.\r\n\r\nI also tested the integrating of this PR into our Spark setup to do the final real-world testing and and all is green.\r\nI'll do a bit more experiments because it's just too easy to overlook some corner cases when fiddling with async + cancellation, but overall it looks good to me.\r\n\r\nAn example for a non-trivial setup now looks like:\r\n```java\r\npublic class MyHadoopRecordReader {\r\n     //  (Various logic)\r\n\r\n    public Stream<Triple> parse(InputStream in) {\r\n        return AsyncParser.of(in, lang, baseIri)\r\n                .mutateSources(parser -> parser\r\n                        .labelToNode(createLabelToNodeAsGivenOrRandom())\r\n                        .resolver(newIRIxResolverAsGiven()))\r\n                .setChunkSize(100)\r\n                .streamTriples();\r\n

href=\"https://github.com/oracle/graaljs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">js's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Version 22.2.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>GraalVM JavaScript is now an installable component of GraalVM. It can be installed with <code>gu install js</code>.</li>\n<li>Enabled option <code>js.foreign-object-prototype</code> by default. Polyglot Interop objects now get a fitting JavaScript prototype assigned unless explicitly turned off using this flag.</li>\n<li>Added intermediate prototype for foreign objects to simplify adapting functionality.</li>\n<li>Removed deprecated experimental option <code>experimental-foreign-object-prototype</code>.</li>\n<li>Removed experimental option <code>commonjs-global-properties</code>. The same functionality can be achieved in user code with a direct call to <code>require()</code> after context creation.</li>\n<li>Added an experimental option <code>--js.zone-rules-based-time-zones</code> that allows to use timezone-related data from <code>ZoneRulesProvider</code> (instead of ICU4J data files).</li>\n<li>Temporal objects can be converted to compatible Java objects when possible, using the <code>Value</code> API's methods like <code>asDate()</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 22.1.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated Node.js to version 16.14.2.</li>\n<li>Graal.js now requires Java 11+ and no longer supports Java 8.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-numberformat-v3\">Intl.NumberFormat v3</a> proposal.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-grouping\">Array Grouping v3</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal\">Temporal</a> proposal. It is available behind the experimental option <code>--js.temporal</code>.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-find-from-last\">Array Find from Last</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Optimized closures to only keep references on variables in the lexical environment that are needed by (one or more) closures. This optimization can be disabled with the experimental option <code>--js.scope-optimization=false</code>.</li>\n<li>Moved the internal string representation to the new TruffleString type.</li>\n<li>Added option <code>--js.string-lazy-substrings</code> (default: true) to allow toggling the copying behavior of string slices. When enabled, string slices internally create string views instead of copying the given string region, which increases performance but may also increase memory utilization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 22.0.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>ECMAScript 2022 mode/features enabled by default.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/intl-displaynames-v2\">Intl.DisplayNames v2</a> proposal.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale-info\">Intl Locale Info</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-DateTimeFormat-formatRange\">Intl.DateTimeFormat.prototype.formatRange</a> proposal.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-extend-timezonename\">Extend TimeZoneName Option</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-enumeration\">Intl Enumeration API</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Updated Node.js to version 14.18.1.</li>\n<li>Added option <code>js.esm-bare-specifier-relative-lookup</code> (default: false) to customize how bare specifiers for ES Modules are resolved. When disabled, bare specifiers are resolved with an absolute path lookup. When enabled, bare specifiers are resolved relative to the importing module's path.</li>\n<li>ICU4J library moved to <code>truffle</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 21.3.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://tc39.es/proposal-private-fields-in-in\">Private Fields in <code>in</code></a> proposal. It is available behind the experimental option <code>--js.private-fields-in</code>.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/JS-BigInt-integration\">JavaScript BigInt to WebAssembly i64 integration</a> proposal. It can be disabled using the <code>--js.wasm-bigint=false</code> option.</li>\n<li>Updated Node.js to version 14.17.6.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-error-cause\">Error Cause</a> proposal.

It can be installed with <code>gu install js</code>.</li>\n<li>Enabled option <code>js.foreign-object-prototype</code> by default. Polyglot Interop objects now get a fitting JavaScript prototype assigned unless explicitly turned off using this flag.</li>\n<li>Added intermediate prototype for foreign objects to simplify adapting functionality.</li>\n<li>Removed deprecated experimental option <code>experimental-foreign-object-prototype</code>.</li>\n<li>Removed experimental option <code>commonjs-global-properties</code>. The same functionality can be achieved in user code with a direct call to <code>require()</code> after context creation.</li>\n<li>Added an experimental option <code>--js.zone-rules-based-time-zones</code> that allows to use timezone-related data from <code>ZoneRulesProvider</code> (instead of ICU4J data files).</li>\n<li>Temporal objects can be converted to compatible Java objects when possible, using the <code>Value</code> API's methods like <code>asDate()</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 22.1.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated Node.js to version 16.14.2.</li>\n<li>Graal.js now requires Java 11+ and no longer supports Java 8.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-numberformat-v3\">Intl.NumberFormat v3</a> proposal.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-grouping\">Array Grouping v3</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal\">Temporal</a> proposal. It is available behind the experimental option <code>--js.temporal</code>.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-find-from-last\">Array Find from Last</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Optimized closures to only keep references on variables in the lexical environment that are needed by (one or more) closures. This optimization can be disabled with the experimental option <code>--js.scope-optimization=false</code>.</li>\n<li>Moved the internal string representation to the new TruffleString type.</li>\n<li>Added option <code>--js.string-lazy-substrings</code> (default: true) to allow toggling the copying behavior of string slices. When enabled, string slices internally create string views instead of copying the given string region, which increases performance but may also increase memory utilization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 22.0.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>ECMAScript 2022 mode/features enabled by default.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/intl-displaynames-v2\">Intl.DisplayNames v2</a> proposal.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale-info\">Intl Locale Info</a> proposal.

When disabled, bare specifiers are resolved with an absolute path lookup. When enabled, bare specifiers are resolved relative to the importing module's path.</li>\n<li>ICU4J library moved to <code>truffle</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 21.3.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://tc39.es/proposal-private-fields-in-in\">Private Fields in <code>in</code></a> proposal. It is available behind the experimental option <code>--js.private-fields-in</code>.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/JS-BigInt-integration\">JavaScript BigInt to WebAssembly i64 integration</a> proposal.

issue resolved #1252.\r\nThis fixes #1457.\r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n\r\nThis is a fix for  #1252 by having writers wait on a lock in the switchable container. Previous, they waited in the transaction coordinator, which is per storage, and changes during compaction. The issue #1252 is a bug when a write starts while compaction is going on. It was blocked (held on a lock) but inside the transaction coordinator for the storage about to be compacted.\r\n\r\n#1457 found when some tests were restored.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Commits have

issue resolved #1432\r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n\r\njena-text integrates with TDB2 by adding a `TransactionalComponent` and becoming part of the TDB/DBOW transaction system.\r\n\r\nThe bug is that the added `TransactionalComponent` is in the storage database, not the switchable database. The storage database is rewritten and rebuilt by a compaction and the added component gets lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n - [N/A] Documentation change and updates are

address the report of JENA-2333\r\n\r\nIt changes the ordering on terms of differing categories (value spaces). e.g. string and integers so that the string (simple and language) are before other datatypes. Previously (up to Jena 4.5.0) the comparison of differing categories was by lexical form first.\r\n\r\nBut two languages, compared by NodeValue, the value-sensitive comparison, was by language tag. This leads to an unstable sort (it is not a total ordering because the condition `A<B` and `B<C` implies `A<C` is not always true. JENA-2333 respots a case where this unstable sort leads to ant exception from `Arrays.sort` from the JDK.\r\n\r\nThis PR is an alternative to #1404.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n -

issue resolved #1407\r\nPull request Description:\r\nWhile the function, property function and service executor registries can be set per context, this is not possible with QueryEngineRegistry. So far engines thus have to be registered globally which can be brittle when a specific engine is wanted to evaluate a query.\r\n\r\nFor example, the default query engine always calls DatasetGraph.listGraphNodes for a pattern `GRAPH ?g { ?s ?p ?o }` - even if ?s, ?p or ?o were concrete and an index could be used instead.\r\n\r\nThe main use case is thus to allow for specifically using the quad-based engine (QueryEngineQuad + OpExecutorQuad) so that evaluation can be handled in the DatasetGraphs.find() method.\r\nWith a single global registry it is hard to guarantee that the desired engine will be chosen in the presence of other query engine factory plugins.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes it possible to override the global QueryEngineRegistry with a context-local one.\r\n\r\nA test case for this use case using Jena's own quad-based engine is provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n - [x] Commits have been squashed to remove intermediate development commit

issue resolved #1435 \r\nPull request Description:\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes implementations of RDFLinkAdapter newQuery / newUpdate methods.\r\nAttempting to use this methods on an instance created with `RDFLinkAdapter.adapt()` using a RDFConnection instance that is not backed by an RDFLink would raise UnsupportedOperationException.\r\nA test case is provided (\"TestRDFConnectionRewrapping\")\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, the classes UpdateExecBuilderAdapter and QueryExecBuilderApdater have been introduced.\r\n'adapt()' methods have been added and wired up.\r\n\r\nThere are two or three methods in QueryExecBuilder that presently cannot be delegated:\r\n- getContext()\r\n- initialTimeout()\r\n- overallTimeout()\r\n\r\n The options I see are:\r\n- extend QueryExecutionBuilder such that delegation becomes possible\r\n- gracefully ignore\r\n- raise UOE (UnsupportedOperationException)\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n - [ ]

issue resolved #1387.\r\nThis fixes #1399.\r\n\r\nPull request Description: This PR adds the following changes to the custom service executor plugin system:\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n\r\n* **chaining** There is now `ChainingServiceExecutor` which allows for transparently forwarding a request to the next `ChainingServiceExecutor` instance in the registry. This way a custom service executor can modify the request and have it processed by the remainder of the chain.\r\n* **bulk processing** The plugin system introduced with jena 4.5.0 only supports lookups with individual bindings. This PR adds support for plugins that want to process bindings in bulk. The main difference in the APIs is whether the `createExecution` method accepts a single `Binding` or a `QueryIterator`. There is now a `ServiceExecutorRegistryBulk` which by default has an registration that delegates to the non-bulk one.\r\n\r\nBreaking changes:\r\n\r\n* `ServiceExecutorRegistry.getFactories()` now returns a `List<ChainingServiceExecutor>` because this is its internal storage; previously it was `List<ServiceExecutorFactory>`. I am afraid re-establishing compatibility in this regard would require a completely new registry with a new context attribute.\r\n\r\nDeprecations:\r\n* Deprecated `ServiceExecutorFactory` in favor of `ServiceExecutor` (ServiceExecutorFactory extends from the latter). Use of the old code delegates to the new one.\r\n    * In the new code the method that creates a `ServiceExecution` is now called `createExecution` (rather than `createExecutor`)\r\n* ~Deprecated `ServiceExecutorRegistry.add` in favor of `prepend`. Both methods add executors to the beginning of the registry's list so they are considered before the default behavior.~ QueryEngineFactory also uses `add` to prepend; so `add` is consistent with existing naming.\r\n* Legacy add method for `ServiceExecutorFactory` exists and wraps it as a `ChainingServiceExecutor`.\r\n* Legacy remove method for `ServiceExecutorFactory` finds previously wrapped elements..\r\n* Deprecated `ServiceExecution` because it doesn't add anything over `QueryIterator`.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Javadoc exists and is up-to-data\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n - [ ] Documentation change and updates are provided for the [Apache Jena website](https://github.com/apache/jena-site/)\r\n - [x] Commits have been squashed to remove intermediate development commit messages.\r\n - [x] Key commit messages start with the issue number (GH-xxxx or JENA-xxxx)\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I acknowledge that I am making a contribution to the Apache Software

request: a convenient way to execute a query against graph in a dedicated context.\r\n\r\nIf we want to execute a query in isolated context with unique set of independent functions and p-functions, \r\nwe will encounter some difficulties:\r\n\r\n- the method `org.apache.jena.sparql.util.Context#copy` performs only shallow copying, not deep\r\n- there is no straightforward way to pass the context while constructing `org.apache.jena.query.QueryExecution`\r\n\r\nSo we have to spend some time to find the proper way.\r\nI think this can be simplified by adding two new helper-methods:\r\n\r\n- `Context#copyWithFunctionRegistries(Context)` - the method to create a copy of `Context` with copied function and p-function registries\r\n- `QueryExecutionFactory#create(Query, Graph, Context)` - the

into the module artifact jar file.\r\n* jena-fuseki-ui: Change the name from \"dist\" to \"webapp\". It is easier to build with the right name at this point rather than mangle file names later because dependency-plug used to unpack the is not string on renaming files.\r\n* In jena-fuseki-webapp uses the dependency-plugin to extract the UI file tree.\r\n\r\n`jena-fuseki-ui` is no longer a dependency in `jena-fuseki-webapp` or `jena-fuseki-war`.

is the PR for https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1369\r\n\r\nIt improves handling of assignents w.r.t. projections by taking the order into account.\r\nAssignments will only be converted into projections if the projection references them in the same order.\r\n\r\nThere is one class cast to ElementGroup which I would like to get rid of and I would need input on what might be the cleanest way to do so.\r\n```\r\n// The following cast may be critical:\r\n// The problem is that here its too late to add to currentGroup()\r\nElementGroup activeGroup = ((ElementGroup)query.getQueryPattern());\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIt adds two more test cases testBind08 and testBind09 that would fail with the prior implementation.\r\nAll other tests continue to work.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest_roundTripQuery(\"SELECT (?x AS ?y) { BIND ('x' AS ?x) }\");\r\n\r\n// Note that below ?x is assigned before ?y, but projected only afterwards\r\ntest_roundTripQuery(\"SELECT

shutdown behavior of a polling thread. The wrong time unit was used causing executor shutdown to take way more time than expected in cases where it's stuck. Thanks to Claus Näveke for spotting this and for the initial PR.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a bug in which condition was not evaluated correctly with small intervals, such as:\nawait().atMost(Duration.ofMillis(10)).pollInterval(Duration.ofMillis(5)).until(..);\n(issue 224). Thanks to Robby Decosemaeker for PR.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upgraded the awaitility-kotlin module to use kotlin 1.6.10</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fail fast conditions can now be specified with assertions. For example:</p>\n<p>await().failFast(() -&gt; assertThat(state).isNotEqualTo(&quot;Failed&quot;)).until(..);</p>\n<p>(issue 238)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/b5d82b703caa88b2ddc2ae0d06020c286d023a79\"><code>b5d82b7</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release awaitility-4.2.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/1ae03495d5a76298ae03f64b1209bc63f049d6b6\"><code>1ae0349</code></a> Preparing changelog for release</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/386eccb7369b6bdb0e434980a0c39ec7c70405a9\"><code>386eccb</code></a> Improve error message in test</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/fc45eb743e7f3a2aec2d57f6d3efd11165c9de44\"><code>fc45eb7</code></a> Fail fast conditions can now be specified with assertions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/d39c00d76af752cfede573453aa904c761c5f6f6\"><code>d39c00d</code></a> Upgrading Kotlin to 1.6.10</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/f359e945794f1c2fc99c6a2cb1b7ac8638394cb8\"><code>f359e94</code></a> Formatted ConditionAwaiter</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/9c9a79bbb8c4a9c1cf5b8822a310e3b9161d07a4\"><code>9c9a79b</code></a> Updated changelog to reflect the latest changes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/9e40d37614fae55588b7d512a447f76804f3e312\"><code>9e40d37</code></a> Fix <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/awaitility/awaitility/issues/224\">#224</a> - handle immidiate success scenario (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/awaitility/awaitility/issues/228\">#228</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/3c9f3450ca3bcf7dd53f8fcf2f7c06675350d9cc\"><code>3c9f345</code></a> Fixed a bug in the shutdown behavior of a polling thread.

changes between GraalVM versions of the GraalVM JavaScript (ECMAScript) language runtime.\nThe main focus is on user-observable behavior of the engine.\nChangelog may include unreleased versions.\nSee <a href=\"https://www.graalvm.org/release-notes/version-roadmap/\">version roadmap</a> for release dates.</p>\n<h2>Version 22.2.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed experimental option <code>commonjs-global-properties</code>. The same functionality can be achieved in user code with a direct call to <code>require()</code> after context creation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 22.1.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated Node.js to version 16.14.2.</li>\n<li>Graal.js now requires Java 11+ and no longer supports Java 8.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-numberformat-v3\">Intl.NumberFormat v3</a> proposal.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-grouping\">Array Grouping v3</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal\">Temporal</a> proposal. It is available behind the experimental option <code>--js.temporal</code>.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-find-from-last\">Array Find from Last</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Optimized closures to only keep references on variables in the lexical environment that are needed by (one or more) closures. This optimization can be disabled with the experimental option <code>--js.scope-optimization=false</code>.</li>\n<li>Moved the internal string representation to the new TruffleString type.</li>\n<li>Added option <code>--js.string-lazy-substrings</code> (default: true) to allow toggling the copying behavior of string slices. When enabled, string slices internally create string views instead of copying the given string region, which increases performance but may also increase memory utilization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 22.0.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>ECMAScript 2022 mode/features enabled by default.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/intl-displaynames-v2\">Intl.DisplayNames v2</a> proposal.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale-info\">Intl Locale Info</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-DateTimeFormat-formatRange\">Intl.DateTimeFormat.prototype.formatRange</a> proposal.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-extend-timezonename\">Extend TimeZoneName Option</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-enumeration\">Intl Enumeration API</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Updated Node.js to version 14.18.1.</li>\n<li>Added option <code>js.esm-bare-specifier-relative-lookup</code> (default: false) to customize how bare specifiers for ES Modules are resolved. When disabled, bare specifiers are resolved with an absolute path lookup. When enabled, bare specifiers are resolved relative to the importing module's path.</li>\n<li>ICU4J library moved to <code>truffle</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 21.3.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://tc39.es/proposal-private-fields-in-in\">Private Fields in <code>in</code></a> proposal. It is available behind the experimental option <code>--js.private-fields-in</code>.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/JS-BigInt-integration\">JavaScript BigInt to WebAssembly i64 integration</a> proposal. It can be disabled using the <code>--js.wasm-bigint=false</code> option.</li>\n<li>Updated Node.js to version 14.17.6.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-error-cause\">Error Cause</a> proposal.

It is available in ECMAScript 2022 (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=2022</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-static-block\">class static initialization blocks</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript 2022 (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=2022</code>).</li>\n<li>Added experimental Polyglot <code>Context</code> option <code>--js.esm-eval-returns-exports</code>. When enabled, <code>eval()</code> of an ES module will return a Polyglot <code>Value</code> containing the ES module exported namespace object. The option is disabled by default.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 21.2.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Graal.js now prints a warning when runtime compilation is not supported. This warning can be disabled using the '--engine.WarnInterpreterOnly=false' option or the '-Dpolyglot.engine.WarnInterpreterOnly=false' system property.</li>\n<li>Added the <code>js.unhandled-rejections</code> option to track unhandled promise rejections in a polyglot <code>Context</code>. By default, the option is set to <code>none</code>, and unhandled promise rejections are not tracked.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-set-methods\">New Set Methods</a> proposal. It is available behind an experimental flag (<code>--js.new-set-methods</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented experimental operator overloading support.

mixture of fixes for problems encountered.\r\n\r\nThe servlet filter `AuthBearerFilter` is now improved from its previous state of being more for testing usage.\r\n\r\nIt is not a complete solution to support in Fuseki for bearer authentication. It is slanted towards support for machine-machine interactions. Token validation still has to be provided by the deployment. A Fuseki module could do this.\r\n\r\nFor example, for OpenID, there is a better solution which is to use the standard Jetty security

resolves GH-1292.\r\n\r\nThe PR covers mainly client-side with a thin interface for responding to bearer auth 401 challenges. The application must a function to provide the token. There is little a standard library can do. The server side has some preparation work but again there has to be custom code somewhere to validate tokens in the deployment environment. This is probaly better done with a Fuseki module - cusomt code for Fuseki main as released.","created_at":"2022-05-24T10:18:52Z","updated_at":"2022-05-28T07:38:26Z","closed_at":"2022-05-27T09:32:47Z","merged_at":"2022-05-27T09:32:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"afc165a21457d9f29840dd3c5b9098ec05d46048","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":23803038,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzgwMzAzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true,"description":"Incrementally

current implementation has some drawbacks:\r\n\r\n* a `LIMIT` on the query is not transparently respected by SPF, as all results are first wrapped\r\n  * while possible to set a custom `LIMIT` in a geospatial property functions like `spatial:withinBoxGeom`, you have to find a value such that a `LIMIT` of the outer query would be reflected in the end\r\n* for each possible found feature based in the geospatial index\r\n  * a separate query iterator is created with a single binding\r\n  * all of which are passed to a concatenating iterator \r\n  * the closing of unconsumed `QueryIterPlainWrapper`s stalls Jena for an extended period of time\r\n  * also that function isn't therefore lazily evaluated\r\n\r\nThe commit makes use of Java streams i) respecting still the
