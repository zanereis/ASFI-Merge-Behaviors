Change Logs\r\n\r\nMetadata table could deem some invalid data as valid in some rare conditions. Especially when there are partially failed commits in MDT and the commit that failed refers to compaction or clustering in data table, we might see some anomalies.\r\n\r\nScenarios where this could fail w/ inline compaction. \r\n\r\nData table timeline\r\nt1.dc   t2.comp.req.     |Crash  t3.dc     t2.comp.inflight    t2.commit\r\n\r\nMDT timeline\r\nt1.dc.  t2.comp.inflight |Crash  t3.dc  t4.rb(t2)           t2.dc\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first attempt of t2 in MDT should be rolled back since it crashed mid-way. in other words, if there are any log blocks written by t2 in MDT, it should be deemed invalid. \r\n\r\nBut what happens is, here is how the log blocks are laid out. \r\n\r\nlog1(t1).  log2(t2 first attempt) crash.... log3 (t3) log4(t4.rb rolling back t2) ... log5 (t2)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, when we read the log blocks via AbstractLogRecordReader, ideally we want to ignore log2. but when we encounter log4 for a rollback block, we only check the previous log block for matching commit to rollback. since it does not match w/ t2, we assume log4 is a duplicate rollback and hence still deem log2 as a valid log block. \r\n\r\nhence MDT could serve more data files which are not valid from a FS based listing standpoint. \r\n\r\nFix: switching failed writes cleaning policy in MDT to EAGER will solve this issue. Prior to this patch, rollback was set to lazy and hence happens only when we trigger clean at the end after delta commit succeeds in MDT.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nStabilized Metadata table.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently, on the reader or query engine side, the direct file listing on the file system is used by default, as indicated by `HoodieMetadataConfig.DEFAULT_METADATA_ENABLE_FOR_READERS` (`=false`).  Without providing explicit config of `hoodie.metadata.enable`, the metadata-table-based file listing is disabled.  However, the `BaseHoodieTableFileIndex`, the common File Index implementation, used by Trino Hive connector, does not respect this default behavior.  This leads to performance regression of query latency in Trino Hive connector, due to way of how the connector is integrated with the Input Format and the File Index with metadata table enabled.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the `BaseHoodieTableFileIndex` to respect the expected behavior defined by `HoodieMetadataConfig.DEFAULT_METADATA_ENABLE_FOR_READERS`, i.e., metadata-table-based file listing is disabled by default.  The metadata-table-based file listing is only enabled when `hoodie.metadata.enable` is set to true and the files partition of the metadata table is ready for read based on the Hudi table config.\r\n\r\nThis PR also cleans up the config setting in `HoodieFileIndex` used by Spark, as `BaseHoodieTableFileIndex` handles the setting of metadata-table-based file listing for all engines.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis mitigates the performance regression of query latency in Trino Hive connector and fixes the read-side behavior of the file listing.\r\n\r\nTested the PR that by default, the `HoodieParquetInputFormat` does not read metadata table for file listing anymore.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\n_Describe context and summary for this change. Highlight if any code was copied._\r\n\r\nIf we enable column stats, for cow table, we'll calculate the stats by reading the parquet footer, calling `columnChunkMetaData.getValueCount()` to get results, this value count actually contains `NULL` count.\r\nBut for MOR table, we don't contain null values for valueCount. So this pr tries to fix it.\r\n\r\nWe can also see the test `TestColumnStatsIndex#testMetadataColumnStatsIndex` could fail because of this issue, as c3 could update null values, so if the table is MOR type, and we use c3's valueCount in https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/268221e4e52183592d36b3b6aff937bc87c3dca6/hudi-spark-datasource/hudi-spark-common/src/main/scala/org/apache/hudi/ColumnStatsIndexSupport.scala#L254, the test could fail.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2022-12-15 at 11 09 41](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10115332/208050494-7903fcff-6a65-4335-8a0e-a71a7b9ca0b8.png)\r\n### Impact\r\n_Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact._\r\n\r\nMake the valuecount consistent between COW and MOR\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nPrior to Hudi's FULL Schema evolution (HFSE) support, Hudi relies on Avro's schema-resolution to perform schema evolution.\r\n\r\nThe exhaustive list of permitted schema-changes that Avro's schema-resolution allows for can be found here:\r\nhttps://avro.apache.org/docs/1.10.2/spec.html#Schema+Resolution\r\n\r\nA summary of the **type changes**  is listed down below:\r\n```markdown\r\nSupported cast conversions:\r\n - Integer => Long, Float, Double, Decimal*, String*\r\n - Long => Float, Double, Decimal*, String*\r\n - Float => Double, Decimal*, String*\r\n - Double => Decimal*, String*\r\n - Decimal => Decimal*, String*\r\n - String => Byte, Decimal*, Date*\r\n - Byte=> String\r\n - Date => String*\r\n\r\n*type conversions that are supported by HFSE, but not in Native Avro's schema-resolution\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current write execution flow is as such:\r\n1. deduceWriterSchema to check if the incoming schema is compatible with table's schema (via _org.apache.hudi.avro.AvroSchemaCompatibility.ReaderWriterCompatibilityChecker#calculateCompatibility_)\r\n2. deduceWriterSchema's validation is an adaptation of Avro's schema compatibility check (_org.apache.avro.SchemaCompatibility.ReaderWriterCompatiblityChecker#calculateCompatibility_); if Avro permits such operation, allow execution to proceed\r\n3. As such if there are implicit schema changes which are compatible with Avro's schema resolution feature, HFSE does not need to be enabled\r\n4. If writer is writing to a different filegroup, this filegroup will be written with a new schema; while existing filegroups that are not written to will contain the old schema\r\n\r\nWhen reading:\r\n1. When reading, the same schema will be used for all the filegroup since nothing is written to `.schema`.\r\n2. Parquet reader will throw errors due to type mismatches when reading\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the Spark-read issues when implicit schema changes are made without enabling HFSE. \r\n\r\nThe scope of this fix is limited to Spark-Read + Spark-Write.\r\n\r\nTODO: Check if issue exists in Flink reader/writer **[WIP; WILL CREATE ANOTHER PR]**\r\nTODO: Implement the same changes to Spark2.4 **[DONE; INCLUDED IN THIS PR]**\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone; no public APIs changed.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis change switches default Write Executor to be `SIMPLE` ie one bypassing reliance on any kind of Queue (either BoundedInMemory or Disruptor's one).\r\n\r\nThis should considerably trim down on \r\n - Runtime (compared to BIMQ)\r\n - Compute wasted (compared to BIMQ, Disruptor) \r\n\r\nSince it eliminates unnecessary intermediary \"staging\" of the records in the queue (for ex, in Spark such in-memory enqueueing occurs at the ingress points, ie shuffling), and allows to handle records writing in one pass (even avoiding making copies of the records in the future) \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nUsers w/ upsert-/insert-heavy payloads should see considerable boost in writing performance.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A \r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses an issue where in a Bootstrapping flow we're incorrectly configuring Parquet reader such that it reads arrays from Parquet being written in an older format (compatible w/ `AvroParquetWriter`) instead of the newer format (default in Spark):\r\n\r\n```\r\n // Old\r\n optional group tip_history (LIST) {\r\n    repeated group array {\r\n      optional double amount;\r\n      optional binary currency (UTF8);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n // new\r\n optional group tip_history (LIST) {\r\n    repeated group list {\r\n      optional group element {\r\n        optional double amount;\r\n        optional binary currency (UTF8);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince bootstrap files are usually a plain Parquet files (likely written w/ default Parquet writer in Spark), we should not try to read these w/ an older configuration of `parquet.avro.add-list-element-records=false` currently being set in Hudi to stay compatible w/ some of its Avro-based Parquet writers.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo impact\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAs of now, we only cache the log file reader inside `HoodieBackedTableMetadata`.  Each time the metadata table is looked up with `getRecordByKey` or `getRecordsByKeyPrefixes` in `HoodieBackedTableMetadata`, the corresponding MT partition is listed through `HoodieTableMetadataUtil.getPartitionLatestMergedFileSlices` because a file system view is constructed each time.  This causes repeated FS list calls on MT partitions and increases the latency for reading metadata table and listing files for data table, affecting Presto query latency for example (sample S3 access log from Presto below for listing `files` partition in MT).\r\n\r\n```\r\n2022-11-24T22:06:43.009Z\tINFO\thive-hive-2\torg.apache.hudi.common.table.view.AbstractTableFileSystemView\tBuilding file system view for partition (files)\r\n2022-11-24T22:06:43.009Z\tDEBUG\thive-hive-2\tcom.amazonaws.request\tSending Request: GET https://<redacted>.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com / Parameters: ({\"prefix\":[\"<redacted>/store_sales/.hoodie/metadata/files/\"],\"delimiter\":[\"/\"],\"encoding-type\":[\"url\"]}Headers: (amz-sdk-invocation-id: 9e963ae0-f2e4-738e-691f-073c5a43264d, Content-Type: application/octet-stream, User-Agent: , aws-sdk-java/1.11.697 Linux/5.4.219-126.411.amzn2.x86_64 OpenJDK_64-Bit_Server_VM/25.342-b07 java/1.8.0_342 vendor/Oracle_Corporation, presto, ) \r\n2022-11-24T22:06:43.022Z\tDEBUG\thive-hive-2\tcom.amazonaws.request\tReceived successful response: 200, AWS Request ID: Y4KHZHYVG7SSB0J4\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the changes to cache the file system view of the metadata table and thus the latest file slices at the partition level for metadata table inside `HoodieBackedTableMetadata` to avoid FS list calls.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis PR avoids repeated file listing on the metadata table and thus reduces the latency for reading metadata table.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently the configs hoodie.datasource.write.keygenerator.class and hoodie.datasource.write.keygenerator.type are used in multiple areas to create a key generator. The idea is to reuse the *KeyGeneratorFactory classes for instantiating KeyGenerator.\r\n\r\nThe Jira adds a KeyGeneratorFactory base class and HoodieSparkKeyGeneratorFactory, HoodieAvroKeyGeneratorFactory extends this base class. These classes are then used in code for creating KeyGenerator.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/7291\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up for #7395. In particular:\r\n\r\n - Internal state (cached record's, writer's schemas) are removed to make sure that `ExpressionPayload` object is serializable at all times\r\n - `ExpressionPayload` caches are scoped down to `ThreadLocal` since some of the re-used components (`AvroSerializer`, `AvroDeserializer`, `SafeProjection`) have internal mutable state and therefore are not thread-safe\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo impact\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up for https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6680\r\n\r\nAfter transitioning of the `HoodieFileIndex` to do file-listing _lazily_ by default, following issue has been uncovered: due to \r\n\r\n - Listing now being delayed (until actual execution of the `FileSourceScanExec` node)\r\n - Spark not providing a generic `Rule` to push-down the predicates (it has `PruneFileSourcePartitions` but it's only applicable to `CatalogFileIndex`)\r\n\r\nStatistics (based on the `FileIndex`) for Hudi's relations have been incorrectly estimated due to now these being delayed until the execution time when partition-predicates are pushed-down to `HoodieFileIndex`.\r\n\r\nTo work this around we're introducing a new `HoodiePruneFileSourcePartitions` rule that is\r\n\r\n - Structurally borrowing from `PruneFileSourcePartitions`\r\n - Pushes down predicates to `HoodieFileIndex` to perform partition-pruning in time, before subsequent CBO stage\r\n - Addresses the issue of statistics for Hudi's relations being incorrectly estimated\r\n\r\nFor more details around the impact of `HoodiePruneFileSourcePartitions`, please check out corresponding `TestHoodiePruneFileSourcePartitions` \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo impact \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nMedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIf someone has enabled schema on read by mistake and never really renamed or dropped a column. it should be feasible to disable schema on read. This patch fixes that. essentially both on read and write path, if \"hoodie.schema.on.read.enable\" config is not set, it will fallback to regular code path. It might fail or users might miss data if any they have performed any irrevocable changes like renames. But for rest, this should work. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nUsers can now disable schema on read feature if need be. \r\n\r\nTesting:\r\nManually tested that we could able to read a table which had schema on read enabled. after disabling, upserts succeed.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow. \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the validation logic inside cleaner tests in `TestCleanerInsertAndCleanByCommits`.\r\n\r\nIn the tests, the `KEEP_LATEST_COMMITS` cleaner policy is used.  This policy first figures out the earliest commit to retain based on the config of the number of retained commits (`hoodie.cleaner.commits.retained`).  Then, for each file group, one more version before the earliest commit to retain is also kept from cleaning.  The commit for the version can be different among file groups.  For example, given the following commits, with `x` denoting a base file written for the corresponding commit and file group,\r\n\r\n```\r\n         c1  c2  c3  c4  c5\r\nfg1:     x        x   x  x\r\nfg2:          x   x   x  x\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith `hoodie.cleaner.commits.retained=3`, no files are cleaned.\r\n\r\nHowever, the current validation logic only statically picks the one commit before the earliest commit to retain in the Hudi timeline, i.e., c2 in the above example, for all file groups, marking the base file written by c1 for fg1 to be expected for cleaning, which does not match the `KEEP_LATEST_COMMITS` cleaner policy.   The validation logic is fixed according to the expected cleaner behavior.\r\n\r\nThis fix is required for CI to pass for #7396.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nOnly fixing flaky tests.  The validation in cleaner tests is now more robust.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently, some partitioners return \"true\" from the \"arePartitionRecordsSorted\" method, even though records might not necessarily be sorted by the partition-path columns as is required by this method. \r\n\r\nI fixed the implementations to sort using the partition path if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nIn the case when these Partitioners are used and the sort column names don't start with the partitionPath, this could lead to a Parquet writers being closed prematurely when writing files creating a lot of small files in the current implementation. This fix will prevent this. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read

For S3 as the storage, 3 requests are avoided, as shown above, which saves at least 40ms.\r\n\r\nThis affects the file listing of partitions based on the metadata table in Presto Hive and Hudi connectors.  This performance fix shaves 10+ seconds for listing ~1800 partitions in a Presto query with metadata table enabled.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR adds two new bulk insert sort modes, `PARTITION_PATH_REPARTITION` and  `PARTITION_PATH_REPARTITION_AND_SORT`, which does the following\r\n- For a physically partitioned table, repartition the input records based on the partition path, limiting the shuffle parallelism to specified `outputSparkPartitions`.   For `PARTITION_PATH_REPARTITION_AND_SORT`, an additional step of sorting the records based on the partition path within each Spark partition is done.\r\n- For a physically non-partitioned table, simply does coalesce for the input rows with `outputSparkPartitions`.\r\n\r\nNew unit tests are added to verify the added functionality.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new bulk insert sort mode.  Existing sort modes are not affected.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nThis PR revises docs for `hoodie.bulkinsert.sort.mode` in `HoodieWriteConfig`.\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe process function output collector is not thread safe, when the async executor in the `CompactionFunction` and the mailbox executor invokes the collector#output concurrently, the output buffer may corrupt.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we replace the `CompactFunction` with a new `CompactOperator` within which the watermark events are ignored intentionally. The mailbox executor would expect to not modify the collector output buffer anymore.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFix the concurremcy conflicts.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n* Upgrade flink to 1.16 in Hudi\r\n\r\n#### Main Changes for this upgrade\r\n\r\n* When doing a hudi flink upgrade, similar to spark upgrades, we must also copy over the module from the latest version and then make changes to resolve incompatibilies. When starting this upgrade I copied over the `hudi-flink-1.15` module and renamed it to `hudi-flink-1.16` and then proceeded with making changes. Therefore the code under `[hudi-flink1.16.x/..` is essientially the same as 1.15 and has been duplicated for sake of keeping in line with a upgrade version ( only minor pom changes has been made to this new module)  \r\n\r\n\r\n*  The following three interface methods are new to `1.16`, introduced in this flink pr https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20299. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/flink/blob/release-1.16.0/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/operators/coordination/OperatorCoordinator.java\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/flink/blob/release-1.15.1/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/operators/coordination/OperatorCoordinator.java\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n  @Override\r\n  public void executionAttemptFailed(int i, int attemptNumber, @Nullable Throwable throwable) {\r\n    // no operation\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public void executionAttemptReady(int i, int attemptNumber, SubtaskGateway subtaskGateway) {\r\n    // no operation\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  @Override\r\npublic void handleEventFromOperator(int i, int attemptNumber, OperatorEvent operatorEvent) throws Exception {\r\n  // no operation\r\n}\r\n\r\n``` \r\n* these new methods are renames of the 1.15 methods such as `subtaskFailed,subtaskReady,etc` but take in an additional parameter `attemptNumber`. In my implementations of these I opted to not use this additional param as in the flink code I saw certain implementations not using this. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/flink/blob/release-1.15.1/flink-table/flink-table-planner/src/main/scala/org/apache/flink/table/planner/codegen/sort/SortCodeGenerator.scala \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/flink/blob/release-1.16.0/flink-table/flink-table-planner/src/main/scala/org/apache/flink/table/planner/codegen/sort/SortCodeGenerator.scala \r\n\r\n\r\n* In flink 1.16 `class SortCodeGenerator(\r\n    tableConfig: ReadableConfig,\r\n    classLoader: ClassLoader,\r\n    val input: RowType,\r\n    val sortSpec: SortSpec)`\r\n\r\nnow has an additional parameter for `classLoader` \r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n* For all the test classes that use the method `handleEventFromOperator` i have set the `attemptNumber` to `0` . This does not seem ideal to me but when checking in the flink github most of the tests set this param to 0. ( Will check with hudi flink committer on this)\r\n \r\n## Testing\r\n* emr hudi flink integ tests pass\r\n\r\n \r\n### Impact\r\nHigh\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\nmedium risk, but users can still use other flink versions. \r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nDocs will need to be updated\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-07T02:35:15Z","updated_at":"2024-03-05T01:38:47Z","closed_at":"2024-03-05T01:38:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6ac5e3541492830a477fc5cf2b32289f053c61f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6615577906,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABilG1Mg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:XL","name":"size:XL","color":"C50833","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\nBefore this change, the NONE sort mode for bulk insert does coalesce for the input records or rows based on the shuffle parallelism of bulk insert (`hoodie.bulkinsert.shuffle.parallelism`) to reduce the parallelism.  This could affect write latency if the cluster workers are not fully utilized due to reduced parallelism.\r\n\r\nThis PR adjusts NONE sort mode for bulk insert so that, by default, coalesce is not applied, matching the default parquet write behavior.  The NONE sort mode still applies `coalesce` for clustering as the clustering operation relies on the bulk insert and the specified number of output Spark partitions to write a specific number of files.\r\n\r\nNew tests are added for the behavior change.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThe removal of coalesce within NONE sort mode for bulk insert will reduce the write latency if the input parallelism is higher and the cluster workers are not fully utilized due to the lower shuffle parallelism of bulk insert.\r\n\r\nFor clustering, there is no behavior change, i.e., coalesce still happens in NONE sort mode for bulk insert in clustering.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n[HUDI-5339](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-5339) for updating docs regarding the behavior change in NONE sort mode for bulk insert.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR cleans up Spark SQL Merge Into implementation fixing some of the performance traps:\r\n\r\n - `SqlTypedRecord` relies on cache using Avro's `Schema`s as a key, therefore entailing that every lookup would entail `Schema.equals` which in turn has non-trivial overhead. Additional problem is that it's done for _every_ field, not just per-record which exacerbates the problem for wider tables.\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n - Cleaned up `SqlTypedRecord`\r\n - Cleaned up `ExpressionCodeGen` to instead handle just Catalyst's `InternalRow`\r\n - Fixed caches w/ expression-evaluators to include target schema into the key to make sure there are no collisions in the cache in case multiple statements might be run w/in the same session\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nShould considerably improve performance for those who use Merge Into\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, Only \"SIMPLE\" and \"GLOBAL_SIMPLE\" index types are supported for virtual keys.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for virtual keys in the non-global and global Bloom Index.  Two major issues that are fixed:\r\n- When looking up record keys in a file group, the `HoodieKeyLookupHandle` first checks the record key against the bloom filter to construct a set of candidates and then fetches all the record keys from the parquet file to filter the candidates and generate the final set of record keys.\r\n  - When virtual keys are enabled (`hoodie.populate.meta.fields=true`), the record keys can be fetched by directly reading meta field of `_hoodie_record_key` from the parquet file.\r\n  - When virtual keys are disabled (`hoodie.populate.meta.fields=false`), the record keys need to be generated on the fly based on the key generator, using the record key fields in the data schema specified by the user.  This is the new logic added in this PR.\r\n- Before this PR, when virtual keys are enabled (`hoodie.populate.meta.fields=false`), the bloom filters are not written to the footer in the parquet files.  This PR fixes the behavior so that bloom filters are always written to the parquet footers (in `HoodieAvroFileWriterFactory`, `HoodieInternalRowFileWriterFactory` and `HoodieSparkParquetWriter`), regardless of whether the virtual keys are enabled.\r\n\r\nTo make it easy to integrate virtual keys with different indexes and write handles, the following changes are done:\r\n- Refactors the code so that the virtual key generator is served from either `HoodieTable` or `BaseHoodieWriteClient`, instead of being passed around through the constructors in many places.\r\n\r\nNew unit tests are added to test the support for virtual keys in Bloom Index. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNow with virtual keys enabled (`hoodie.populate.meta.fields=false`), Bloom Index is supported to unlock better upsert performance when needed.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nUpdate docs of virtual keys\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nfix https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-5327\r\n\r\nCurrently, collect is used internally in bulk insert for [[Dataset<Row>] when execute clusting, which cause\r\n\r\n1. A single spark job is generated within it, and if there are many clusting groups, too many spark jobs  will be generated, which makes the spark app not simple enough\r\n2. Because Executor is not explicitly specified when submiting spark Jobs through `supplyAsync`, the number of spark jobs that can be executed simultaneously is limited to the number of CPU cores of the driver, which may cause a performance bottleneck\r\n\r\nSo, just remove collect in `bulk insert for [[Dataset<Row>]]`\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMake spark app simper, avoid possible performance bottlenecks when enable `hoodie.datasource.write.row.writer.enable`\r\nIn addition, performClusteringWithRecordsRDD does not have the above problems, because it does not use collect internally, so I just keep their behavior consistent\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ]

Change Logs\r\n\r\nfix https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-5326\r\n\r\n1. Modify the file division strategy in SparkSizeBasedClusteringPlanStrategy\r\n(1) Sort fileSlices before dividing, which makes dividing more compact, just like spark's [approach](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/DataSourceScanExec.scala#L725) (optimization)\r\n(2) Avoid output clustering group size exceeding `hoodie.clustering.plan.strategy.max.bytes.per.group` (bug fix)\r\n\r\n2. Set the maximum size of the file written by clustering to `hoodie.clustering.plan.strategy.max.bytes.per.group` to avoid the generation of small files\r\nE.g: Under the new strategy, if we set we set max.bytes.per.group=20, target.file.max.bytes=10, the size of files by clustering will fluctuate around 10, use `target.file.max.bytes` as the threshold will split many small files when size > 10.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nrefer to above\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR is addressing some of the performance traps detected while stress-testing Spark SQL's Create Table as Select command:\r\n\r\n - Avoids reordering of the columns w/in CTAS (there's no need for it, `InsertIntoTableCommand` will be resolving columns anyway)\r\n - Fixing validation sequence w/in `InsertIntoTableCommand` to first resolve the columns and then run validation (currently it's done the other way around)\r\n - Propagating properties specified in CTAS to the `HoodieSparkSqlWriter` (for ex, currently there's no way to disable MT when using CTAS precisely b/c of the fact that these properties are not propagated)\r\n \r\n\r\nAdditionally following improvements to `HoodieBulkInsertHelper` were made:\r\n\r\n - Now if meta-fields are disabled, we won't be dereferencing incoming `Dataset` into RDD and instead simply add stubbed out meta-fields t/h additional `Projection`\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nShould marginally improve performance of both Bulk Insert (row-writing) and CTAS\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI
