this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2018-06-07T06:24:34Z","updated_at":"2018-06-07T09:21:07Z","closed_at":"2018-06-07T09:20:43Z","merged_at":"2018-06-07T09:20:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"58dab96da4430efd54e6c563011eb6a9b2dbb861","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1898/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1898/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1898/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a0cc05e7d74c837bdcff574e3dc40d80e038babc","head":{"label":"beiwei30:common-utils-unit-test","ref":"common-utils-unit-test","sha":"a0cc05e7d74c837bdcff574e3dc40d80e038babc","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"f4974c69b5fedcb896259bcc06ee2e7e7c00111a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-06T07:38:22Z","updated_at":"2018-06-06T08:23:51Z","closed_at":"2018-06-06T08:23:47Z","merged_at":"2018-06-06T08:23:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"04c26e6cb0f07d776769f2e53edd7ef92e078f77","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1891/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1891/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1891/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7a6130682d29851f6cf188d3220836dbfc1ac287","head":{"label":"beiwei30:commonutis-test","ref":"commonutis-test","sha":"7a6130682d29851f6cf188d3220836dbfc1ac287","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"00c4201cf8d67db5fe0447ee1e183ad49f51f945","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAsync support for provider and consumer.\r\n* Consumer, support method with extra Future return type\r\n```java\r\n@AsyncFor(GreetingsServices.class)\r\npublic interface GreetingsServiceAsync extends GreetingsServices {\r\n    CompletableFuture<String> sayHi(String name);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWe also provide a tool to do that: [dubbo-async-processor](https://github.com/dubbo/dubbo-async-processor)  \r\n* Provider, support async like what Servlet 3.0 async works.\r\n```java\r\npublic class AsyncServiceImpl implements AsyncService {\r\n\r\n    public String sayHello(String name) {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Main sayHello() method start.\");\r\n        final AsyncContext asyncContext = RpcContext.startAsync();\r\n        new Thread(() -> {\r\n            System.out.println(\"    -- Async start.\");\r\n            try {\r\n                Thread.sleep(500);\r\n            } catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n                e.printStackTrace();\r\n            }\r\n            asyncContext.write(\"Hello \" + name + \", response from provider.\");\r\n            System.out.println(\"    -- Async end.\");\r\n        }).start();\r\n        System.out.println(\"Main sayHello() method end.\");\r\n        return \"hello, \" + name;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDrawbacks and following enhancements:\r\n* For both consumer and provider async, response can't be processed with Filter chains anymore.\r\n* Context still can't be restored between threads.\r\n\r\nThanks for @yuyijq for contributing code and ideas with #606.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change has been deploy to central maven repository with a 2.6.3-SNAPSHOT version. You can see details of how to use from these two projects:\r\n[dubbo-async-processor](https://github.com/dubbo/dubbo-async-processor)  \r\n[dubbo-samples](https://github.com/dubbo/dubbo-samples/tree/samples_for_2.6.3-SNAPSHOT)  \r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n#","created_at":"2018-06-01T10:27:14Z","updated_at":"2018-06-14T01:06:29Z","closed_at":"2018-06-14T01:06:28Z","merged_at":"2018-06-14T01:06:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"08205284b8e107b61d4db9959dc760b78b1af1a5","assignee":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1876/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1876/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1876/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/274d594a0c31b2fb7f8e1913014d69ffd0fdf65f","head":{"label":"chickenlj:develop-async-response","ref":"develop-async-response","sha":"274d594a0c31b2fb7f8e1913014d69ffd0fdf65f","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apa

Unit tests\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdd related test case.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue.

trying to find a solution to mock memcached.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nCI Pass\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-29T09:26:39Z","updated_at":"2018-05-31T02:23:12Z","closed_at":"2018-05-31T02:23:12Z","merged_at":"2018-05-31T02:23:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"900ab0b28ccce6e2fed4c2f73679a936282a349f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1859/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1859/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1859/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a1380ccc7d0da940394a36d591d6a9a0b2c45e92","head":{"label":"DeadLion:master","ref":"master","sha":"a1380ccc7d0da940394a36d591d6a9a0b2c45e92","user":{"login":"DeadLion","id":2594907,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTQ5MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2594907?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeadLion","html_url":"https://github.com/DeadLion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeadLion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeadLion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeadLion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeadLion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeadLion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeadLion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeadLion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeadLion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeadLion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":102587231,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDI1ODcyMzE=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"DeadLion/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DeadLion","id":2594907,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTQ5MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2594907?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeadLion","html_url":"https://github.com/DeadLion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeadLion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeadLion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeadLion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeadLion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeadLion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeadLion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeadLion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeadLion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DeadLion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DeadLion/dubbo","description":":loudspeaker:

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-29T04:19:19Z","updated_at":"2018-05-29T04:20:07Z","closed_at":"2018-05-29T04:19:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1858/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1858/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1858/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/430fb4c6c7a85f90c9817a6c5e11aebadb312770","head":{"label":"apache:2.5.x","ref":"2.5.x","sha":"430fb4c6c7a85f90c9817a6c5e11aebadb312770","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-26T13:53:07Z","updated_at":"2018-05-26T14:17:23Z","closed_at":"2018-05-26T13:53:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54a535e400c7e02d8c5aee62de37220d796a5adb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1854/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1854/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1854/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a0081b668dd2daa0f853cacc7bd93f3eb84d6e42","head":{"label":"alvygao:master","ref":"master","sha":"a0081b668dd2daa0f853cacc7bd93f3eb84d6e42","user":{"login":"alvygao","id":2690164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTAxNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2690164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvygao","html_url":"https://github.com/alvygao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvygao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvygao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvygao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvygao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvygao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvygao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvygao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvygao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvygao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123892202,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM4OTIyMDI=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"alvygao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"alvygao","id":2690164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTAxNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2690164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvygao","html_url":"https://github.com/alvygao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvygao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvygao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvygao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvygao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvygao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvygao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvygao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvygao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alvygao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/alvygao/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-25T16:14:39Z","updated_at":"2018-05-28T02:21:16Z","closed_at":"2018-05-28T02:21:16Z","merged_at":"2018-05-28T02:21:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"22624508bbd30dd83b09b48303196d7dcd73c410","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1851/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1851/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1851/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b587d2f10c49dc9fc8628de8a6472f62804cae86","head":{"label":"hqq2023623:fix#1845","ref":"fix#1845","sha":"b587d2f10c49dc9fc8628de8a6472f62804cae86","user":{"login":"hqq2023623","id":6971152,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NzExNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6971152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623","html_url":"https://github.com/hqq2023623","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":113030978,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTMwMzA5Nzg=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"hqq2023623/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hqq2023623","id":6971152,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NzExNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6971152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623","html_url":"https://github.com/hqq2023623","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hqq2023623/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2018-05-23T08:43:17Z","updated_at":"2018-05-25T02:16:00Z","closed_at":"2018-05-25T02:11:08Z","merged_at":"2018-05-25T02:11:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"47adfd047b2df5ab2f5ca9740e85676ce53066f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1836/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1836/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1836/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6a8424f67819f2b55cc36db255841433e7a23190","head":{"label":"beiwei30:issue667","ref":"issue667","sha":"6a8424f67819f2b55cc36db255841433e7a23190","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"300f9c9fe1e4de8f14b494d8bf835b4e1ac6d5d6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

changelog\r\n\r\ncom.alibaba.dubbo.cache.filter.CacheFilter\r\ncom.alibaba.dubbo.cache.filter.CacheFilterTest\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2018-05-22T07:01:00Z","updated_at":"2018-07-23T12:04:09Z","closed_at":"2018-05-22T07:25:36Z","merged_at":"2018-05-22T07:25:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"a6d8f1c5b20d30b3fe3206332d56bc6de1baa282","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/17","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/17","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/17/labels","id":3285726,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzI4NTcyNg==","number":17,"title":"2.6.3","description":"A

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe corresponding issues are #1768, #19  This PR support generic invocation in HttpProtocol/HessianProtocol, and pass attachments HttpRemoteInvocation and through http headers from consumer to provider.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nTo export additional GenericService in HessianProtocol/HttpProtocol for supporting normal/nativejava/bean types of generic invocation.\r\n\r\nAdd RpcContext attachments to Http Header and HttpRemoteInvocation attributes.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nHttpProtocolTest/HessianProtocolTest is the corresponding unit tests.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-22T06:42:26Z","updated_at":"2018-07-23T12:15:32Z","closed_at":"2018-06-01T07:02:54Z","merged_at":"2018-06-01T07:02:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"286fb12b011fd878b3d44ff6985e082e2141a164","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/17","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/17","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/17/labels","id":3285726,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzI4NTcyNg==","number":17,"title":"2.6.3","description":"A

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImprove compatibility for graceful shutdown.\r\nThe implementation fo #1763 lack consideration for compatibility.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n* Create a dedicated class DubboShutdownHook, and make it singleton.\r\n* Restore ProtocolConfig#destroyAll() for compatabitility.\r\n* Register DubboShutdownHook in static initialization of AbstractConfig.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nUnit test passed.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-20T08:04:43Z","updated_at":"2024-01-19T12:09:14Z","closed_at":"2018-05-31T08:07:21Z","merged_at":"2018-05-31T08:07:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"1b553fd8112c5be291e1a2fedd4279554040d6d3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1820/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1820/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1820/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0ecca8a5f92e305de2ed0e294a7a1efc5c97fbbc","head":{"label":"ralf0131:improve-graceful-shutdown","ref":"improve-graceful-shutdown","sha":"0ecca8a5f92e305de2ed0e294a7a1efc5c97fbbc","user":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119020526,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTkwMjA1MjY=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"ralf0131/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

I guess travis ci has some issue.\r\nHope pull request CI can pass in dubbo repo travis ci.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-16T06:29:29Z","updated_at":"2018-07-23T12:02:43Z","closed_at":"2018-05-17T08:21:31Z","merged_at":"2018-05-17T08:21:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"3c55c802ac4553467d8fa109ac4601f4935d2766","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/17","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/17","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/17/labels","id":3285726,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzI4NTcyNg==","number":17,"title":"2.6.3","description":"A

changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2018-05-15T09:54:28Z","updated_at":"2018-05-15T10:58:47Z","closed_at":"2018-05-15T10:57:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ab43fa894177170d0926a339c4bb492f94c0f5f7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1804/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1804/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1804/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/553ca6743f81e619f5f127e2ba95e4862910e3de","head":{"label":"beiwei30:common-utils-unit-test","ref":"common-utils-unit-test","sha":"553ca6743f81e619f5f127e2ba95e4862910e3de","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"3c6201cf1821d8e5f46573f6a2e204d7abfd9f18","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-13T13:42:22Z","updated_at":"2018-05-13T13:42:41Z","closed_at":"2018-05-13T13:42:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1791/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1791/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1791/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/bb8e93ebceaaabe21806683277ca7824b81b9246","head":{"label":"apache:2.6.2-release","ref":"2.6.2-release","sha":"bb8e93ebceaaabe21806683277ca7824b81b9246","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nunit test for ServiceConfig\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

pass\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-11T02:52:36Z","updated_at":"2018-05-11T09:09:03Z","closed_at":"2018-05-11T09:09:03Z","merged_at":"2018-05-11T09:09:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"3516df569777b2ec6fbe20f130f3c342caf3f476","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1779/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1779/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1779/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f027b02ced4f71b006b3d0d0b58070262c8e5d73","head":{"label":"diecui1202:hessian-spell-mistake","ref":"hessian-spell-mistake","sha":"f027b02ced4f71b006b3d0d0b58070262c8e5d73","user":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":125145570,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjUxNDU1NzA=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","description":"Dubbo

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nunit test for RegistryConfigTest\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix the issue that Dubbo cannot shutdown elegantly.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n* Introduce a Bootstrap class to easily start/stop Dubbo when running without Spring.\r\n* Introduce DubboApplicationListener to listen to the Spring lifecycle event to start/stop Dubbo under Spring.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* Verified under embedded mode (without Spring) and under servlet container.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n1. Use loadBalance policy when providers less 2\r\n2. Fix AbstractClusterInvokerTest OutOfMemoryError\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. Remove the following code fragment in AbstractClusterInvoker.java :\r\n```java\r\n-        // If we only have two invokers, use round-robin instead.\r\n-        if (invokers.size() == 2 && selected != null && !selected.isEmpty()) {\r\n-            return selected.get(0) == invokers.get(0) ? invokers.get(1) : invokers.get(0);\r\n-        }\r\n```\r\n2. Add clear invocation operation after invoking in AbstractClusterInvokerTest.java : \r\n```\r\nMockito.clearInvocations(invoker1, invoker2, invoker3, invoker4, invoker5);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAll test cases are pass.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\npart of unit test for config-api module\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nunit test for config-api module\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2018-05-09T04:21:55Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T09:53:24Z","closed_at":"2018-05-09T09:53:17Z","merged_at":"2018-05-09T09:53:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"ca8883924466f0d3eeeac6b19e42ad228d6ae8ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1758/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1758/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1758/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/75664c3bfb2f937c1934c1b8bb7e8cb99e45bbb5","head":{"label":"beiwei30:config-api-unit-test","ref":"config-api-unit-test","sha":"75664c3bfb2f937c1934c1b8bb7e8cb99e45bbb5","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"0592e84a3c07b4451e81d2eecc0c51af384858d2","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-05T04:11:58Z","updated_at":"2018-05-14T08:17:14Z","closed_at":"2018-05-14T07:48:41Z","merged_at":"2018-05-14T07:48:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"322add3243aaa92f7d56cf68377ff065326337fa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1741/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1741/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1741/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7a5c1297833c652ac5eeba81beef22acbecbe095","head":{"label":"diamondblack:chore/add-unit-test-for-monitor","ref":"chore/add-unit-test-for-monitor","sha":"7a5c1297833c652ac5eeba81beef22acbecbe095","user":{"login":"diamondblack","id":36391423,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM2MzkxNDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36391423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diamondblack","html_url":"https://github.com/diamondblack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diamondblack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diamondblack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diamondblack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diamondblack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diamondblack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diamondblack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diamondblack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diamondblack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diamondblack/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"04c93e8b98250230c4d22423372acd1c29e2c770","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd unit tests for MulticastRegister. \r\n\r\nFix #1691 , the MulticastRegister parts.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n* Add unit tests for MulticastRegister\r\n* add some comments to methods\r\n* fix some typo\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

pass.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-02T09:07:20Z","updated_at":"2018-05-03T08:26:13Z","closed_at":"2018-05-03T08:26:13Z","merged_at":"2018-05-03T08:26:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"db039c68d916ba74f03d87e61f667d689961a6bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1726/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1726/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1726/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/38f7fd242ccd24cbe0a49ba7219bf60350a470af","head":{"label":"diecui1202:ut-serialize","ref":"ut-serialize","sha":"38f7fd242ccd24cbe0a49ba7219bf60350a470af","user":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":125145570,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjUxNDU1NzA=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"diecui1202","id":1152291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1152291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202","html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/diecui1202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/diecui1202/incubator-dubbo","description":"Dubbo

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2018-04-28T09:05:25Z","updated_at":"2018-05-03T06:11:10Z","closed_at":"2018-05-03T05:45:54Z","merged_at":"2018-05-03T05:45:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"46c6ccb32d6ba9ac79f5b7478d84537a468a0de4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1716/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1716/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1716/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/bc4c79d0959665b795715e57135f2838e4d99cc0","head":{"label":"beiwei30:config-api-unit-test","ref":"config-api-unit-test","sha":"bc4c79d0959665b795715e57135f2838e4d99cc0","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"9e9e778e04aa95501e4ab9b49e8f927527e7e260","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n\r\nFixes

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-26T08:07:58Z","updated_at":"2019-05-24T07:49:26Z","closed_at":"2018-04-26T10:51:03Z","merged_at":"2018-04-26T10:51:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"9e9e778e04aa95501e4ab9b49e8f927527e7e260","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/17","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/17","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/17/labels","id":3285726,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzI4NTcyNg==","number":17,"title":"2.6.3","description":"A

changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-25T14:20:33Z","updated_at":"2018-06-11T05:59:39Z","closed_at":"2018-06-11T05:59:39Z","merged_at":"2018-06-11T05:59:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"624d3aea9c1f1f7759c71b00dd38a9bdb720cd8d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1675/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1675/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1675/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c6549bbf19a4502d0e5a6baa3786d863126b84f4","head":{"label":"lonre:master","ref":"master","sha":"c6549bbf19a4502d0e5a6baa3786d863126b84f4","user":{"login":"lonre","id":181109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre","html_url":"https://github.com/lonre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"764761dbf6d1131674d9034bfff4af22ae6d0fcb","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.
