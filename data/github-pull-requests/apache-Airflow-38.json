Now, we interpret that and render it in the graph view with logical gates.\r\n\r\nDatasets that actually had events will be highlighted with a different border so it's easy to see what triggered the selected run.\r\n\r\nAlso, added a check to still create a dataset node if there is a dataset event even if the getDatasets endpoint didnt return anything.\r\n\r\nThese are both workarounds. It would best to refactor the dag graph python code to accept a `with_datasets` param and handle this logic and include dataset aliases too. Hopefully, I can make that a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1118\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-30 at 5 36 47â€¯PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bc7b88e-5748-4ade-9bd3-a9ac9d26dc08\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code changes, an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvement+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\nIn case of backwards incompatible changes please leave a note in a newsfragment file, named `{pr_number}.significant.rst` or `{issue_number}.significant.rst`, in [newsfragments](https://github.com/apache/airflow/tree/main/newsfragments).\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-30T21:43:10Z","updated_at":"2024-08-01T01:27:19Z","closed_at":"2024-07-31T12:59:02Z","merged_at":"2024-07-31T12:59:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"16ed4df3d00c73838261214a6c0570208289425e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2172800850,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwODUw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:improvement","name":"type:improvement","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: Improvements"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

current code has been only checking when the session is created in tests - to see if the aiflow code is not using the session, However, Sometimes when session is created in the tests and passed to \"airflow\" code (say running a task) - the session can be passed directly and it does not matter where the session is created but where it is used. This PR implements checking of that - and handles better the edge cases.\r\n\r\nThe message is also improved in this case - we show the exact case where the session was used in airflow, on top of the whole stacktrace so you should be able to see easily what the problem is.\r\n\r\nRelated: #41067\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

API access across the open-source, cloud, and enterprise versions. \r\nThis means all of them have a single method `client_id` and `client_secret` to [authenticate to the API](https://reference.airbyte.com/reference/authentication) now. \r\nThis pull request remove the dependency of `HttpHook` and uses the `airbyte-api` Python SDK library to execute all operations

a long time now, we have been able to create the metadata database from the ORM without going through the migration files. However, the migration files were not pruned because it would result in users being unable to roll back to a previous version. There's now an opportunity to prune this and start afresh. The migration files are getting more significant, and there are benefits to this pruning. Top in my mind is that the FAB migrations will no longer be in the airflow migration file, which would help in removing FAB from the Airflow core.\r\n\r\nThis change also means we can no longer create a new database from the migration file. We can only do that through the ORM. I considered creating the 'current schema' in the migration file, which means having the database representation in the migration file and helping to create it from scratch.

Why\r\n1. DatasetAlias should be unique. However, the existing logic does not handle that part.\r\n2. The original logic only keeps the dataset alias in one dag file.\r\n\r\n## What\r\n1. Added the unique constraint to `DatasetAliasModel`\r\n2. Remove the deletion logic of `DatasetAlias`. It now works ok, but the unique dataset aliases will accumulate. I'm thinking of doing something similar to `TaskOutletDatasetAliasReference` and will create another PR for it.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Why\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/40478, we're able to create a dataset event and thus potentially trigger a DAG run through setting `outlets=DatasetAlias(...)`. However, the dataset events created in this way do not appear in the task instance detail.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/673d0eba-45b3-407e-b604-2700610b7d62)\r\n\r\n\r\n## What\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the set `has_outlet_datasets` to true if `DatasetAlias` (which could potentially trigger a DAG run) exists in `outlets.`\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

#41085\r\n\r\nHere is a small example to illustrate the problem:\r\n```python\r\nclass InitMeta(type):\r\n    def __new__(cls, name, bases, namespace, **kwargs):\r\n        new_cls = super().__new__(cls, name, bases, namespace, **kwargs)\r\n        new_cls.__init__ = new_cls.__init__\r\n        return new_cls\r\n\r\n\r\nclass A(metaclass=InitMeta):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n

because `B.__init__` was set to `A.__init__` at the B class definition time, but this is not what MRO is doing.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I propose patching `__init__` only if the class actually defines

#41067\r\n\r\nAttempted to fix `tests/core/test_core.py` but did not make it.\r\nNevertheless 50% of progress is within this PR: The dag_maker needs to commit changes such that tests fetching data from internal API can find it (ACID in DB needs to commit, else a different connection does not see INSERTs).\r\nAlso the internal API loading task instance details failed in loading details from DAG, switched to DagBag.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, still the test fails in spaghetti with the following stack - I am not sure how to fix this, I fear there is a new cut as internal API needed but I am unsure on which function. Either I need a hint or somebody needs to make this in a follow-up PR - clearly `refresh_from_db` will fail if not being internal API:\r\n```\r\n____________________________ TestCore.test_timeout

PR is part of #10388. This fixes BashOperator for Windows as reported on #41063.\r\ncloses: #41063\r\n- `preexec_fn` is not supported on Windows\r\n- ~~close_fds=True on Windows, otherwise, we can get a race condition where the process is still holding onto the directory resulting in an exception:~~\r\n\r\n```\r\n  File \"C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps\\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.12_3.12.1264.0_x64__qbz5n2kfra8p0\\Lib\\shutil.py\", line 637, in _rmtree_unsafe\r\n    os.rmdir(path)\r\nPermissionError: [WinError 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\xxx\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\airflowtmpngs54_vn'\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `TemporaryDirectory` will call `shutil.rmtree()` internally when the context exits. On Windows, `shutil.rmtree()` is unreliable and there is a race condition where even after `self.sub_process.wait()`, the process will still be holding onto the directory causing an exception. The work-around is to call `shutil.rmtree()` in a retry loop. If we're not running under Windows, `shutil.rmtree()` is reliable and no retry loop is needed.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

PR removes AIP-44 feature flag and replaces \"in-progress-disabled\" test with dedicated \"DatabaseIsolation\" one.\r\n\r\nThe DatabaseIsolation test will run all \"db-tests\" with enabled DB isolation mode and running `internal-api` component - groups of tests marked with \"skip-if-database-isolation\" will be skipped.\r\n\r\n - [ ] tests/models/test_taskinstance.py (32 tests failing)\r\n - [ ] tests/operators/test_python.py (2 tests failing)\r\n - [ ] tests/sensors/test_external_task_sensor.py (2 tests failing)\r\n \r\nSome of those tests might need to be excluded as they make no sense to be run (for example if those are tests that are testing scheduler or webserver code). It might also be that we need to improve our test harness for isolation mode in some cases. \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nHow to run the tests? It's fairly easy to run the tests with breeeze (you can checkout this pr with `gh pr checkout 41067` and work on top of it.\r\n\r\nYou can run tests using DB isolation already using database isolation. It works in the way that you need to enter breeze shell --database-isolation, split the terminals with tmux, run internal-api component in one of them and then you can run pytest tests in the other terminal. Again - sources are mounted to inside the container so you can easily iterate on tests (ctrl-c restart internal-api to pick up changes).\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/testing/unit_tests.rst#running-tests-with-database-isolation for detailed description.\r\n\r\nOne tests that fully works for now is dag_processing/test_job_runner.py for example and a good way to see how it works - you will see that the test initializes DB direcly, but then the dag_processing code calls the internal-api server and you will see messages going back-forth in the \"internal-api\" output.\r\n\r\nYou should make sure that you use `pytest --run-db-tests-only` flag - and all non-db tests will be skipped, that should speed up your tests when you run whole module or directory.\r\n\r\n----- \r\n\r\nHow to submit fixes?\r\n\r\nAfter you make a fix - submit a PR explaining which tests are fixed with `Related: #41067` in the commit message, That's it. I will be continuously rebasing this PR on top of main and keeping the inventory of what has been fixed. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

incremental library 24.7.0 and 24.7.1 have been broken (the 24.7.0 has been yanked already but 24.7.1 has still a breaking change - it plugs in setuptools/distutils in the way that when virtualenv is invoked incremental will scan pyproject.toml in the current directory and fails if it finds something that it see as inconsistency (where it apparently is not). Unfortunately it happens when just `python -m virtualenv` is invoked so generally it breaks all our tests that are creating a virtualenv using it.\r\n\r\nThis is tracked in https://github.com/twisted/incremental/issues/106\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

By using only `ti.state`, there is no way of knowing if it failed or not, it looks the same as the one being passed to `get_listener_manager().hook.on_task_instance_start`.\r\n\r\nWe should probably move the listener call to after, we assign the `FAILED` or `UP_FOR_RETRY` state, so that we can use that information.

reverts PR #40864 and PR #40471.\r\n\r\nPreviously, PR https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/40471 was contributed to address issue https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/35433. \r\nHowever, that contribution gave rise to another issue https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/40788. \r\nNext https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/40788 was being attempted to be resolved in PR #40864. \r\nHowever, with the second PR, it appears that the previous old \r\nissue #35433 has [resurfaced](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/40864#issuecomment-2239061933). So, at the moment, the case is \r\nthat we have 2 PRs on top of the existing implementation \r\neventually having nil effect and the previous issues persists. \r\nI believe it is better to revert those 2 PRs, reopen the earlier \r\nissue #35433 and peacefully address it by taking the needed time.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

can now use self-hosted ARM runners to run ARM builds instead of spinning our own instances. This PR brings back those builds to use the ASF runners.\r\n\r\nThis still does not solve the problem of building multi-platform images because with buildkit we need to have two interconnected machines with two different platforms to build such an image and this is not easy/possible with GitHub Actions. We might need to eventually manually generate manifest and put together such images later, but for now we build those images manually.\r\n\r\nRelated: #40925\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

case of database isolation, some of our tests are running a number of fixtures that allow for example to create dag runs as setup code - this code, however sometimes runs methods that are used for internal_api calls and those calls are not needed to be run via internal_api.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds capability of detecting such case - by checking if any of the \"callers\" of the internal_api are `conftest.py` which means that this is a test fixture - and in this case, direct method call is used rather than internal API call.\r\n\r\nThis way we better separate test code from \"airflow\" code in DB isolation tests - and internal API is only used by the tested methods and not the test code that manages setup/teardown\r\n\r\nAlso orm_create_dagrun which should only be used in scheduler is unmarked as \"internal_api\" method - it is heavily used in the fixtures, but neither DAGFileProcessor, Triggerer nor Worker should create new DAGRuns.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software

PR disables SLA miss callback for DB isolation mode because it would require quite a havy refactoring (or rather rewriting from the scratch). Currently SLA miss calculation heavily depends on the fact that both - DB is available and DAG code is parsed\r\n- basically that we have DAG object in memory that has the logic that allows to calculate SLA misses while querying Airflow DB multiple times. It's likely possible to unentangle it and make the logic separate from the DAG object, but it's not really good idea to do it now. It's better to disable it.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

SBOM generation with cdxgen was slow-ish because cdxgen tried to install all requirements of airflow (and failed) - and then had fallen back to just using what is provided.\r\n\r\nAfter opening discussion in\r\nhttps://github.com/CycloneDX/cdxgen/discussions/1270 the maintainer of cdxgen implemented a fix in the latest version where he exposed lifecycle parameter to cdxgen server which we are using.\r\n\r\nWith lifecycle=pre-built the whole step of installation is skipped and 25 SBOMS for one airflow version (after pulling the latest cdxgen image) takes ~ 2 minutes instead of 6 minutes previously.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR fixes all the tests for dag_processing for db isolation mode.\r\n\r\nSome of them required slight changes (for example session object is not used by internal-api components and asserts for it won't work).\r\n\r\nSome of them required fixes in the codebase as they found real errors.\r\n\r\nLogging at the internal-api server for request/request parameterss sent and responses have been changed to info from debug - this is useful information to show when internal api server works and we can lower the level when we are closing to releasing 2.10.0\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software
