SUMMARY\r\nHotfix for #21895\r\n\r\nThe existing `merge(defaultSchema, htmlSchemaOverrides)` replaces the array item rather than appending, so override item can pollute the default schema configuration.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst htmlSchemaOverrides = {\r\n   tagNames: ['iframe'],\r\n}\r\n- with `merge(defaultSchema, htmlSchemaOverrides)\r\n==>  ['iframe', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', ...]\r\n\r\n- with this hotfix\r\n\r\n==>  ['h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', ..., 'iframe']\r\n```  \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n- Add custom `tagNames` items in `HTML_SANITIZATION_SCHEMA_EXTENSIONS` and then create markdown h1\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n-

connector has `allows_alias_to_source_column = False` which was not replicated in the Trino connector. This is required to resolve issues when the same column name is used in both the inputs and outputs, i.e., \r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT\r\n    foo\r\nFROM \r\n    ...\r\nGROUP BY \r\n    foo\r\nORDER BY\r\n    MAX(foo) \r\n```\r\n\r\nas it isn't evident which `foo` the `MAX(foo)` is referring to. This results in the Trino error, \r\n\r\n```\r\nInvalid reference to output projection attribute from ORDER BY aggregation\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI and tested

SUMMARY\r\nAdds an embedded property to the existing dashboard API that returns the embedded configuration if it exists. This users can use the API with a single call to get a list of embeddable dashboards, whilst currently this would require an extra API request per dashboard.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nRun the branch, set the `EMBEDDED_SUPERSET` to `True` and configure a dashboard as embeddable within the UI. Request the dashboard api from `/api/v1/dashboard`  and request the specific dashboard api from `/api/v1/dashboard/{id}`  and review the embedded configuration.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\nIf there are additional automated tests that need adding and/or if the embedded configuration on the API needs to be behind the same `EMBEDDED_SUPERSET` please

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently filter cascading is only supported on value filters. This adds cascading to time and numerical filters. Since the time column control is now shared between the dependent filter and pre-filter sections, it will render the time column picker in either section that is relevant.\r\n\r\n### VIDEO\r\nDemo of how time filters can now cascade:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/224089182-5e3ff108-e595-4787-ab7f-5cffb5ab416e.mp4\r\n\r\nValue filter affecting numerical range:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/224090635-5fcf9189-631b-458e-bb9b-74881c0b16ff.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Add a time filter and value filter\r\n2. Make the value filter dependent on the time filter\r\n3. Notice how changing the time filter affects the value filter\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing

SUMMARY\r\nI went looking around for docs that I remembered that had added about the \"filter simulator\" feature that @cccs-jc had added in #14765 but couldn't find it. It turns out it had been lost during the Docusaurus migration. This re-adds the missing section and does the following additonal changes:\r\n- port the example to use the new `where_in` macro\r\n- reformat some old code blocks to make them more consistent\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOT\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/224021333-55f820ae-06b0-4afe-96b1-5bd8035d6f26.png)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

addresses recommendation #&#x2060;1 in https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/14383.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the the native filter modal was calling the RESTful GET `/api/v1/dataset/{pk}` endpoint twice (without parameters): once when it needed the columns with a dataset and once for when it required the metrics et al.\r\n\r\nThough these calls were in theory where cached (using a local cache) via the `cachedSupersetGet` method, the local cache was defined multiple times (on a per file basis) rather than once for the entire modal. \r\n\r\nThe TL;DR is local caches are great, so long as they're not too local. The fix is merely to define the native filter modal caching mechanism once so it can be shared by the various components.\r\n\r\nI guess a broader question is whether rather than using a local cache whether should be caching on the server and using a 304 status code.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### BEFORE\r\n\r\nWhen opening the modal there are two calls to the GET

addresses recommendation #&#x2060;1 in https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/14383 by requesting‚Äîvia the FAB API‚Äîonly the required fields (columns) from the `/api/v1/dataset/{pk}` RESTful GET endpoint.\r\n\r\nFetching the entirety of dataset (especially a very large datasets) can be rather expensive which. https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22413 made significant performance improvements (reducing the response time from > 300 seconds to ~ 5 seconds) however later https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23113 was introduced to address some performance tradeoffs (in other contexts) by disabling eager loading (increasing the response time from ~ 5 seconds to ~ 30 seconds). The bulk of this increased cost was from the repeated lazy loading of the back referenced table i.e., `self.table`, for every dataset column (even though this is always the same table; possibly a SQLAlchemy quirk) for a subset of the `TableColumn` fields including the advanced data type.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates‚Äîin the context of the native filters modal‚Äîthe `/api/v1/dataset/{pk}` requests to fetch only the subset of columns required in the response. This helps to ensure the we're:\r\n\r\n1. Not building overly complex SQLAlchemy queries on the backend.\r\n2. Reducing the response payload.\r\n\r\nFor the dataset in question said change reduced the response time from ~ 30 seconds to ~ 3 seconds which significantly improves the UX when interfacing with the modal. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\nAt Airbnb, there's a bunch query results including `JSON` data which can easily reach to the max storage size.\r\n<img width=\"1439\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-03-07 at 12 20 04 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1392866/223543151-fde935de-cfbd-4d01-8d8b-7c36a20b980c.png\">\r\n\r\nThe current empty-out logic only cleans based on the query age, so the huge size of the query result can be stored in localStorage until it expires. However, this long-lived large size query result can not only be disrupted by continuous warning messages, but also slow down SQLlab due to the cost of JSON.stringify on the large JSON object.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds the extra empty-out logic for the large size query results.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n- specs\r\n- go to sqllab with `SQLLAB_BACKEND_PERSISTENCE` off\r\n- run a query that contains large-size JSON column results\r\n- keep using sqllab and check the speed\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in

SUMMARY\r\nFixes a bug which caused the dashboard to load infinitely when it contained a native filter which initially is out of scope and has \"Select first filter value by default\" option selected.\r\n\r\nThe bug occurred because dashboard starts loading only after native filters with \"Select first filter value by default\" option load first. However, if a filter is out of scope, it won't load until user changes tab so that it's finally in scope.\r\nTo fix that, this PR force renders filters out of scope if any native filter uses \"Select first filter value by default\" option. That, of course, is not an optimal solution as we opt out of an optimization of not rendering the filters out of scope until they are needed.\r\nOptimally, only the charts affected by such native filters should wait for those filters to load instead of delaying rendering the whole dashboard. However, implementing that would require a large refactor and given the urgency of this bug I believe the current solution is sufficient for now.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/223431563-46610b8e-cd98-402d-bb8b-8fed0d82e328.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/223434008-8bf14b17-4a66-43f4-9a7e-9117b0049ccc.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a dashboard with tabs and add a chart to second tab\r\n2. Add a native filter, enable \"Select first filter value by default\", set the scope only to the second tab\r\n3. Navigate back to dashboards list and refresh the page.\r\n4. Open the dashboard\r\n5. Verify that it loads correctly\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ]

#22190 , When a user is trying to access the dashboard link it says you don't have access to this Dashboard instead of redirecting user to the login page.

SUMMARY\r\nIt is often necessary to sort a categorical bar chart by a column that isn't\r\n1. the x-axis\r\n2. the main metric\r\n\r\nThis is often needed when the underlying categories are ordinal, i.e. have a rank order.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the possibility to sort by the series limit metric which is added to the query if it's needed for sorting the query results. To achieve this, one can add a rank ordering dimension to the data and then use that for sorting. In the future we could consider supporting additional metrics in a separate control that could be used to set the color, size or additional context on the tooltip, similarly to how Tableau does it.\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOT\r\nSee how we are now able to choose the column from the Sort By control:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/222718306-15ff40c2-0671-4442-ad35-d5c4b653b0c2.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWhen using horizontal orientation on the bar chart, the base axis labels are rendered in reverse order, i.e. the first element is on the bottom. This is in contrast to e.g. Tableau that renders the first item on the top. In addition to the order being incorrect, this sometimes causes the first category to fail to render if there's not enough space to render all labels. This is due to the labels being rendered from first to last, meaning that currently the bottom label always gets rendered.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a database migration that flips the sorting flag for existing horizontal bar charts to avoid inverting previously created charts.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow flipping the orientation renders the first item on top:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/222674897-f1fb50e4-23b4-4891-90f5-90239b1c8b51.mp4\r\n\r\nWhen the chart size is squeezed, the first category (Michael) is always rendered, even if some categories need to be truncated:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/222667770-8f053da3-529d-4d51-9894-a0c1e5544cd8.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously the first item was on the bottom:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/222674983-46d98e9d-a484-4893-96e0-0e55d4e8192d.mp4\r\n\r\nPreviously the last category (Elizabeth) was always rendered, and the first category (Michael) sometimes didn't show up:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/222667680-90f431c8-cf2d-40e5-a2e1-ff773b257771.png)\r\n\r\n# Migration\r\nA dashboard with two bar charts, one vertical and the other horizontal, previously rendered with the top value (Michael) missing on the horizontal bar chart:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/222963834-b789699c-6610-4e1a-852d-bf82a4259c6c.png)\r\n\r\nAfter running the migration, the charts look the same, with the vertical one unaffected, and the horizontal one showing the top value as expected:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/222963877-8d81df58-59fd-4fd3-b679-d1a4ac7abb02.png)\r\n\r\n### Screens from Tableau:\r\nVertical:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/222675592-4909b831-ae8c-4b37-ad31-aa3068db2280.png)\r\n\r\nHorizontal:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/222675494-4f0c21a9-2b9c-4cd9-b28b-c20ee3f64832.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

recommendation #&#x2060;6 in https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/14383.\r\n\r\nSpecifically it adds a new CLI group command‚Äîwhich behaves in the same vein as an Alembic migration‚Äîfor allowing admins to upgrade/degrade dashboards with legacy filters (filter-box charts and filter scopes) to native filters. i.e., \r\n\r\n```\r\nsuperset native-filters upgrade --all  // All dashboards\r\nsuperset native-filters upgrade --id <id-1> --id <id-2>  // Specific dashboards\r\n\r\nsuperset native-filters downgrade --all  // All dashboards\r\nsuperset native-filters downgrade --id <id-1> --id <id-2>  // Specific dashboards\r\n\r\nsuperset native-filters cleanup // Removes filter-box assets and interim metadata which enables downgrading \r\n```\r\n\r\n[This document](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/8668e65578a83699c6d79cc0114c780c1cf8d0e0/docs/docs/miscellaneous/native-filter-migration.mdx) (included in the PR) outlines the specific logic of the script and what is expected from dashboard owners.\r\n\r\nThis logic is based on https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/16992 (specifically the [filterboxMigrationHelper.ts](https://github.com/graceguo-supercat/superset/blob/3a27565fe65f4f166ea7ade3d1ee8580ef8f9c17/superset-frontend/src/dashboard/util/filterboxMigrationHelper.ts) file).\r\n\r\nThough I'm relatively confident on the logic‚ÄîI can't really grasp JavaScript‚Äîthere are some differences between @graceguo-supercat's script and my logic which maybe @ktmud, @nytai, @rusackas, @villebro, et al. could review:\r\n\r\n1. Default values are defined either at: i) the dashboard level, or ii) the chart level. In @graceguo-supercat's script the default value is either: i) the dashboard default, ii) the chart default, or iii) the chart default if no dashboard default is defined. This varies by filter type and I'm unsure whether this was an oversight/error‚Ä° or merely replicating Superset's logic. In my implementation precedence is first given to the dashboard level defaults (assuming they're valid per the chart configs) before falling back to the filter-box level defaults if undefined. The one caveat is pre-conditional filters which (after testing in Superset) it seems like these using the chart temporal defaults, i.e., the dashboard defaults are ignored.\r\n2. The value filter types support pre-filters which can contain a time-range and associated time column (see screenshot). Thought @graceguo-supercat never set the time column, which per the tooltip indicates it will fallback to the default time column (I assume of the dataset), I have explicitly set this (regardless if it is the default) as i) I believe it improves the UX from a readability standpoint, i.e., it is evident which column the time range corresponds to, and ii) there's no guarantee that that a dataset will have a default temporal column.\r\n\r\n‚Ä° Per [here](https://github.com/graceguo-supercat/superset/blob/3a27565fe65f4f166ea7ade3d1ee8580ef8f9c17/superset-frontend/src/dashboard/util/filterboxMigrationHelper.ts#L286-L299) there's logic to fallback to the chart level `time_grain_sqla` if there's no dashboard level default, i.e., \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndashboardDefaultValues || time_grain_sqla\r\n```\r\nhowever the prior `if (!isEmpty(dashboardDefaultValues)) {` condition would mean that the `||` would never be evaluated. I sense this was an error with the previous implementation, i.e., the logic should have been,\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst defaultValues = dashboardDefaultValues || time_grain_sqla;\r\n\r\nif (!isEmpty(defaultValues)) {\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same is true for the [granularity_sqla](https://github.com/graceguo-supercat/superset/blob/3a27565fe65f4f166ea7ade3d1ee8580ef8f9c17/superset-frontend/src/dashboard/util/filterboxMigrationHelper.ts#L326-L345) column however the [time_range](https://github.com/graceguo-supercat/superset/blob/3a27565fe65f4f166ea7ade3d1ee8580ef8f9c17/superset-frontend/src/dashboard/util/filterboxMigrationHelper.ts#L246-L249) column and [value](https://github.com/graceguo-supercat/superset/blob/3a27565fe65f4f166ea7ade3d1ee8580ef8f9c17/superset-frontend/src/dashboard/util/filterboxMigrationHelper.ts#L475-L485) columns seem correct. Note in my current implementation I _always_ fallback to the chart level default if not defined at the dashboard level.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"437\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-03-14 at 8 35 45 AM\"

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis is a quick fix to remove some ts warnings. The replaceChildren method had some cross-browser compatibility issues for a while and therefore wasn't fully supported in typescript. Microsoft started supporting the type in some later versions, but whether it's because we're using the babel plugin for embedded or what, when I bumped the versions, I still am seeing this ts error, plus it introduced a few more. I decided just to comment this out for now so that we can spend more time writing tests for this feature before making any changes that might affect runtime stability.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nThe error in the console was `Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'replaceChildren')` That should be resolved with this change. \r\n\r\n###

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses recommendation #&#x2060;5 in https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/14383.\r\n\r\nThe \"set filter mapping\" dashboard menu option (see screenshot) is used to configure the filter scopes for legacy (filter-box) filters. By defaults filter scopes are implicitly defined, i.e., charts have no immunity to filter-boxes, however users can explicitly specify them (by defining their scope and inclusion/exclusion logic). \r\n\r\nThough both legacy and native filters can coexist the behavior is not ideal from a UX perspective, i.e., when the `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS` feature is enabled users should strive to solely use the native filters functionality/modal to define filtering whilst simultaneously removing legacy filter-box charts.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that if the `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS` feature is enabled and no legacy filter mapping is explicitly defined (filter-box charts can be present*) then the menu option to set the mapping should not be present, i.e., we should prevent users from having the ability to define legacy filter scopes. The TL;DR is we want to prevent users from creating new  legacy filter scopes when the feature is enabled.\r\n\r\n\\* If filter-box charts are present then (per my previous comment) implicit filter scope logic is still adhered to even if there's no explicitly defined legacy filter scopes. The TL;DR with this change users wont be able to configure the filter-box charts' scopes/immunity, however users should be encouraged to simply remove the filter-box charts from the dashboard and replace them with native filters.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"182\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-03-08 at 10 11 39 PM\"

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n#### Problematic to solve:\r\nTo manage translation for dimensions, we need to create various calculated dimensions for each language.\r\nIf you want your dashboard to be translated in 5 languages, let's say because your organisation is present in 5 countries. So in this case you may create 5 calculated dimensions (for each column) that corresponds to the number of translations. And you need to create 1 dashboard / language using the appropriate translated column.\r\nThe total number of translation is the product of `distinct values count for all columns x languages`\r\n\r\n#### Feature description\r\nThis PR introduce a new function to Jinja context that allows translation ability for features with the least effort.\r\nThe used library is `translate == 3.6.1`, it's quite simple as it calls api of translation services such as : `deepl`, `mymemory`, `microsoft` or also `libre translate`. This brings the ability to translate and have all in 1 dashboard and reduce number of calculated columns.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n\r\nto handle translations for SQL we have to handle it value by value, so we create as many custom dimensions as the number of languages that we want to handle\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT \r\n    CASE \r\n     WHEN value = 'Good morning' THEN 'Bonjour'\r\n     WHEN value = 'Good evening' THEN 'Bonsoir'\r\n     ELSE 'No translation found'\r\n    END AS greeting_fr\r\n```\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nThings could get much simpler, by creating 1 custom dimension or write it directly inside your dataset SQL query.\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT {{translate(value, 'fr')}} AS greeting_fr\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT {{translate(value, from_language='en', to_language='fr', add_to_cache_keys=True, escape_result=True)}} AS greeting_fr\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Set `\"ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PROCESSING\": True` on the config\r\n2. Optional: set `TRANSLATION_PROVIDER` to one of the available providers `deepl`, `mymemory`, `microsoft`, `libre`.\r\n3. Test on SQL Lab or create your dynamically translated dimension\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [x] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\nThis PR includes a fix of the error: `error: Unused \"type: ignore\" comment` that happens during the pre-commit. \r\n\r\n### Some next steps doable after this PR: \r\n\r\nIf this PR is accepted as a feature for superset, there is some next step features that could be implemented, or created on the issue tab.\r\n- **feature 1:** Create translation table that maps values to their various translations in other languages. That could be enriched through the interface or through file imports. Therefore the current `translate` template will mainly use the translation mappings if exists and fallback on the api if the translation is not found.\r\n- **feature 2**: Link the translation to the selected language on Superset\r\n- **feature 3**: Send the translation language on the body of the guest_token for embedding","created_at":"2023-03-01T17:59:46Z","updated_at":"2024-12-12T18:06:49Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329203144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MjAzMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/M","name":"size/M","color":"705FA3","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6757605397,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABksjgFQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/review:draft","name":"review:draft","color":"FF5A5F","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/23252/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/23252/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/23252/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/statuses/9746e29463773497f6fa2e2609b56c5e785b7843","head":{"label":"AddouIsmail:feat/jinja_translate","ref":"feat/jinja_translate","sha":"9746e29463773497f6fa2e2609b56c5e785b7843","user":{"login":"AddouIsmail","id":11146678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTQ2Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11146678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddouIsmail","html_url":"https://github.com/AddouIsmail","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddouIsmail/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddouIsmail/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddouIsmail/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddouIsmail/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddouIsmail/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddouIsmail/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddouIsmail/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddouIsmail/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddouIsmail/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":605702149,"node_id":"R_kgDOJBpIBQ","name":"superset","full_name":"AddouIsmail/superset","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AddouIsmail","id":11146678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTQ2Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11146678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddouIsmail","html_url":"https://github.com/AddouIsmail","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddouIsmail/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddouIsmail/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddouIsmail/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddouIsmail/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddouIsmail/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddouIsmail/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddouIsmail/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddouIsmail/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AddouIsmail/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AddouIsmail/superset","description":"Apache

SUMMARY\r\n#23118 caused a regression that made the `BaseDAO` unable to find objects if the base query contained joins to other tables. This is because the filter was often ambiguous, as the id column is the same on all tables. Interestingly this regression was not caught because we didn't have an integration test that tested updates for non-admin users that didn't have the \"all_datasource_access\" perm.\r\n\r\nThis PR does the following:\r\n- Changes the filter in `BaseDao` to filter specifically by the `id_column_name` of the `model_cls`\r\n- Updates the non-admin chart update API integration tests to use the `gamma_no_csv` user instead of `alpha`. Previously this test didn't catch the regression, because Alpha users short circuit the base filters due to having \"all_datasource_access\". By using the `gamma_no_csv` user with explicit access to the examples dataset, we can ensure that the full base filter is being applied, and catches a potential regression. With these changes, this test failed on master branch.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow updating the chart works as expected:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/222098227-ae8b67dc-2555-4c2b-852f-197fdc17e091.mp4\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously, the chart was not found:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/222098288-f8a00379-cfcc-4011-a212-2f5424c25a30.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWhen there are charts using different datasets in a dashboard and a cross filter is applied on an adhoc column, the charts that use different dataset than the origin chart are crashing with a db error.\r\nThis PR fixes that by excluding filters based on an incompatible adhoc column from the query.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1728\"

Create a chart that is grouped by an adhoc column (with sql expression) and add it to a dashboard\r\n2. Add another chart to a dashboard, which should use a different dataset than the first chart\r\n3. Apply a cross filter by clicking on a series related to the adhoc column in the first chart\r\n4. Verify that the second chart doesn't crash and is not filtered by the cross filter\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

Externalized code referencing <code>React.useInsertionEffect</code> to a separate <code>@emotion/use-insertion-effect-with-fallbacks</code> package. This package should be used in your defined externals if you bundle Emotion for whatever reason. It references <code>useInsertionEffect</code> in a very specific way that allows us to use it conditionally. However, if the code consuming Emotion is bundled as a library with Emotion in it then some bundlers might change the way in which we reference <code>useInsertionEffect</code> and that might create problems for bundlers used to consume the said library code. By externalizing this new package you can still bundle Emotion if you want to without running into this problem as you won't &quot;destroy&quot; the carefully crafted reference to <code>useInsertionEffect</code> in the process.</p>\n<p>Note that we don't recommend bundling Emotion. You should have very specific reasons to do so.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Updated dependencies [<a href=\"https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/commit/89b6dbb3c13d49ef1fa3d88888672d810853f05a\"><code>89b6dbb3</code></a>]:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>@‚Äãemotion/use-insertion-effect-with-fallbacks</code><a href=\"https://github.com/1\"><code>@‚Äã1</code></a>.0.0</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><code>@‚Äãemotion/react</code><a href=\"https://github.com/11\"><code>@‚Äã11</code></a>.10.0</h2>\n<h3>Minor Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/emotion-js/emotion/pull/2819\">#2819</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/commit/bbad8c79937f8dfd5d93bf485c1e9ec44124d228\"><code>bbad8c79</code></a> Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/nicksrandall\"><code>@‚Äãnicksrandall</code></a>! - <code>exports</code> field has been added to the <code>package.json</code> manifest.

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nRight now when editing a Database you created using the `Dynamic Form` you won't see the `SSH Tunnel` toggle, so you  you won't be able to add the tunnel after creating the DB this way.\r\n\r\nThis is happening because we forgot to add the switch component into one of the three places we are rendering the `Dynamic Form (<DatabaseConnectionForm>)` in our `DatabaseModal`.\r\n\r\nSo, now we are consolidating all those repetitive code into one single method and reusing it when needed thus avoiding such things in the future.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user created a new dashboard or added a chart to an existing dashboard, the cross filters would not work properly until the page was refreshed (and hydrate dashboard was triggered). The reason for that is that the cross filters configuration for each chart was created only on dashboard hydration, but not on dashboard save. This PR fixes that behaviour.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/221249185-7b7a4e96-49c5-4ff3-a264-c3069f8a1586.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/221249247-d0e43da0-2eb9-4d58-b2ff-d40962775f06.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open a dashboard and click Edit\r\n2. Add a chart to the dashboard and save\r\n3. Apply cross-filter on some other chart\r\n4.

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhen duplicating datasets, we currently are forcing columns on the new dataset to have `groupby` and `filreable` set to `True` even if the user marked those as false in the base dataset. With this changes we are fixing that. Also did a small refactor in how we raise exceptions so they are all in the `validate` method and using existing exceptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n![error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38889534/221206730-04342723-704e-4c88-a8e4-4d9d1249551e.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38889534/221206798-6242c12c-5bca-46d7-a718-22000edae1fe.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a Virtual dataset\r\n2. Create a `calculated column` in your new dataset\r\n3. Check `isFilterable` for the new column and save the changes\r\n4. Open the new dataset for edition and uncheck `isFilterable` so it is False\r\n5. Duplicate the dataset\r\n6. The new dataset must have `isFilterable` unchecked\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR addresses 2 bugs:\r\n1. When user applied cross filters in the dashboard and then clicked the search icon in filters badge, the whole dashboard would go grey and become non-interactive. The only way to fix it was to refresh the dashboard.\r\n2. When user applied native filters and then clicked on a search icon in filters badge, the native filter would get highlighted (correctly) but also all charts in scope of that filter would get highlighted. That behaviour is desired only when user manually hovers or focuses the native filter, not when they want to see which native filter is affecting given chart\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/221197365-0e26fb26-2cd8-46b5-91a8-6f5a51c7794c.mov\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/221197161-d698ed3f-f009-4e7a-9c45-4b4c882348c7.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open a dashboard and apply a cross filter\r\n2. Verify that the search icon in filters badge focuses the emitter chart (should also change the tab and scroll the chart into view if necessary)\r\n3. Apply a native filter\r\n4. Verify that the search icon in filters badge focuses the native filter. Charts in scope of that filter should not be highlighted unless user manually focuses the native filter or hovers over it.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with

SUMMARY\r\nThis introduces a native db engine spec for the Clickhouse-Connect driver. With this spec the Superset specific logic can be removed from the native driver. Some notable changes to the Superset entrypoint in the driver:\r\n- Shared functionality with the `sqlalchemy-clickhouse` spec are broken out into a base spec for both ClickHouse specs.\r\n- Query labels are aliased with a hash of the original expression. This is because the dialect had trouble handling aliased columns when a column referenced in the expression had the same name as the alias, e.g. `toDateTime(time) as time`. \r\n- Since ClickHouse has very un-ANSI type names, custom type regexes are implemented to catch typical types listed in the official docs: https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/data-types/\r\n- Unit tests for most known column types are added, including some checks for potential false positives, e.g. `Enum('Int32', 'Bool')`.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nTesting on Explore. Note the column aliases:\r\n<img width=\"1476\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/221146311-43bf4e4b-2bf6-43c2-bdff-868799846be3.png\">\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously a simple temporal chart wouldn't render:\r\n<img width=\"1476\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/221139374-78fffeed-dd3e-47b4-a017-6da0973889b8.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nContinuing the effort on deprecating all /superset/ REST API endpoints\r\nDeprecates `/superset/favstar`, which allowed to fav/unfav/count charts/dashboards for:\r\n* `/api/v1/dashboard/<pk>/favorites/` POST/DELETE (to add/remove fav status)\r\n* `/api/v1/chart/<pk>/favorites/` POST/DELETE (to add/remove fav status)\r\n* Replaced the usage of `/superset/favstar` to check for favorite status in favor of the `/favorite_status` resource within dashboard/chart resource.\r\n\r\nAlso, fixed an issue that would only load the favorite status for a given chart/dashboard in explore once, so, if the user went back and selected a different one, the change didn't reflect.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable
