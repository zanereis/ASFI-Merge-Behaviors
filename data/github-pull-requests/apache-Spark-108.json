What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe main purpose of this pr is introducing `ProtobufSerDe` as an SPI to make other modules easy to register ProtoBufSerializer. The main change as folows:\r\n\r\n- Introducing `ProtobufSerDe`, it contains 3 public api\r\n  - `supportClass`: used to specify the data types supported by the current `ProtobufSerDe`\r\n  - `def serialize(input: Any): Array[Byte]`: used to serialize the input data of the type corresponding to `supportClass` to `Array[Byte]`, since the current input parameter type is `Any`, the input type needs to be guaranteed from the code level\r\n  - `def deserialize(bytes: Array[Byte]): Any`: used to deserialize the input `Array[Byte]` to an object of the type corresponding to `supportClass`\r\n\r\n- Refactor the current `XXXSerializer` to inherit `ProtobufSerDe` and implement the corresponding functions \r\n- Introducing `org.apache.spark.status.protobuf.ProtobufSerDe` file to register existing `ProtobufSerDe`\r\n- Refactor `KVStoreProtobufSerializer` to load `ProtobufSerDe` from `org.apache.spark.status.protobuf.ProtobufSerDe` and use them to `serialize` and \r\n`deserialize` the input data\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake other modules easy to register ProtoBufSerializer\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting `KVStoreProtobufSerializerSuite` should cover this refactor

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nJust creating a small PR to start progress on the Spark-PyTorch Distributor. This is a WIP project and I left questions and comments to discuss how I will be approaching certain aspects of the code.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis just proposes the baseline API for how users will interact with the Spark PyTorch distributor ([Design Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QPO1Ly8WteL6aIPvVcR7Xne9qVtJiB3fdrRn7NwBcpA/edit?usp=sharing)).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe design document's [background](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QPO1Ly8WteL6aIPvVcR7Xne9qVtJiB3fdrRn7NwBcpA/edit#heading=h.cxcvohcybvo2) section goes into more detail about the why.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, this proposes an [API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QPO1Ly8WteL6aIPvVcR7Xne9qVtJiB3fdrRn7NwBcpA/edit#heading=h.5ifxsbo5fk8d) for how users will interact with the PyTorch Distributor. The [user workflow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QPO1Ly8WteL6aIPvVcR7Xne9qVtJiB3fdrRn7NwBcpA/edit#heading=h.8yvw9xq428fh) is also proposed in that design document.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch adds ORDER BY ALL support to SQL. ORDER BY ALL is a syntactic sugar to sort the output by all the fields, from left to right. It also allows specifying asc/desc as well as null ordering.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt's a good convenience sugar added initially by DuckDB to avoid repeating the fields.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. See above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded SQL tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-21T00:36:17Z","updated_at":"2022-12-23T04:52:47Z","closed_at":"2022-12-23T04:52:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d0f3a7a4e1e6cd841965d0abaa5e3a0cab7c80d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39144/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39144/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39144/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fd6b753461dc7e862e0219c63747ad3bdbcb247c","head":{"label":"rxin:orderbyall","ref":"orderbyall","sha":"fd6b753461dc7e862e0219c63747ad3bdbcb247c","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce `pyspark.errors` and error classes to unifying & improving errors generated by PySpark under a single path.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the changes below:\r\n- Add error classes for PySpark and its sub error classes into `error-classes.json`.\r\n- Add `PySparkErrors` in JVM side to leverage the existing error framework\r\n- Add new module: `pyspark.errors`\r\n- Add new errors defined in `pyspark.errors.errors` that return the `PySparkException` by leveraging new error classes.\r\n- Migrate the errors into error classes for `pyspark/sql/functions.py`\r\n- Add tests for migrated errors.\r\n- Add test util `check_error` for testing errors by its error classes.\r\n\r\nThis is an initial PR for introducing error framework for PySpark to facilitate the error management and provide better/consistent error messages to users.\r\n\r\nWhile such an active work is being done on the [SQL side to improve error messages](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-37935), so far there is no work to improve error messages in PySpark.\r\n\r\nSo, I'd expect to also initiate the effort on error message improvement for PySpark side from this PR.\r\n\r\n**Next up** for this PR include:\r\n- Migrate more Python built-in exceptions generated by driver side into PySpark-specific errors.\r\n- Migrate the errors generated by `Py4J` into PySpark-specific errors.\r\n- Migrate the errors generated by Python worker side into PySpark-specific errors.\r\n- Migrate more error tests into tests using `checkError`.\r\n- Currently all PySpark-specific errors are defined as `PySparkException` class. As the number of PySpark-specific errors increases in the future, it may be necessary to further refine the `PySparkException` into multiple categories\r\n- Add documentation\r\n\r\nWill add more items to [umbrella JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-41597) once initial PR get approved.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCentralizing error messages & introducing identified error class provides the following benefits:\r\n- Errors are searchable via the unique class names and properly classified.\r\n- Reduce the cost of future maintenance for PySpark errors.\r\n- Provide consistent & actionable error messages to users.\r\n- Facilitates translating error messages into different languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but only for error message. No API changes at all.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql import functions as F\r\n>>> F.window(\"date\", 5)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nTypeError: windowDuration should be provided as a string\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n```python\r\nTraceback (most recent call

the GraalVM team, we have been investigating the possibility of generating native images of Spark applications by compiling them ahead of time with GraalVM Native Image (https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/). Being compatible with Native Image offers another deployment option to users who can benefit from instant startup, a smaller memory footprint, and a small packaging size (no JVM needed at runtime). However, Native Image relies on `java.lang.ClassLoader` for class loading. That means all classes loaded by one loader must have unique names. On Native Image, we have a special way of handling dynamically generated classes and use a single loader to load them all. So, their names must be unique and stable across runs.\r\nOn the Spark side, `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.CodeGenerator` generates classes that are all named “GeneratedClass” but have different bytecodes. A simple approach to make Spark Native Image friendly is to use unique and stable names for those classes. A suggestion could be to append `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.CodeAndComment#hashCode` to the end of such a generated class.\r\nMoreover, generated classes in Spark could have lambdas in their body, which can also lead to unstable bytecodes even after the change above since lambdas contain their memory address in their generated names. Stripping this memory address will guarantee stable bytecodes also in this case. So with those two small changes, we can make all Spark-generated classes Native Image friendly. The minimal reproducer that fails on both Java and Native Image is in the attachment.\r\nWith this patch, we can successfully run all 8 Spark benchmarks from the popular Renaissance benchmark suite as native images:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch implements GROUP BY ALL, similar to the one initially implemented in DuckDB. When specified, the analyzer automatically infers the grouping columns based on the expressions specified in the select clause: all expressions that don't include any aggregate expressions are pulled implicitly into the grouping columns. This avoids users having to specify individually the list of grouping columns in most cases.\r\n\r\nExamples: \r\n\r\n```\r\nselect key, count(*), sum(score) from table group by all\r\n-- rewritten to\r\nselect key, count(*), sum(score) from table group by key\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt's nice convenience syntactic sugar for interactive sql to avoid repeating the grouping columns/expressions in group by, when they can be implicitly inferred. It actually brings SQL a little bit closer to the DataFrame API in terms of usability for aggregations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. This is a user facing syntactic sugar for SQL.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test cases homegrown, as well as test cases from DuckDB and Mosha.\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-20T04:54:51Z","updated_at":"2023-11-06T13:27:46Z","closed_at":"2022-12-22T11:59:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"784faf166c31c6ef7864acebf330c8562dd44392","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39134/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39134/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39134/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/693c2e9d3c9cfa061273d918a979d6ebeab8aa77","head":{"label":"rxin:groupbystar","ref":"groupbystar","sha":"693c2e9d3c9cfa061273d918a979d6ebeab8aa77","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2.

A generator function can be registered in the table function registry and resolved as a table function during analysis.\r\n\r\nNote this PR only adds support for two built-in generator functions: `explode` and `explode_outer` with literal input values. We will support more generator functions and LATERAL references in separate PRs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make table-valued generator functions more user-friendly and consistent with Spark's built-in table function Range.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Before this PR, the built-in generator function explode/explode_outer cannot be used in the FROM clause:\r\n```\r\nselect * from explode(array(1, 2))\r\n\r\nAnalysisException: could not resolve `explode` to a table-valued function;\r\n```\r\nAfter this PR, we can support this usage:\r\n```\r\nselect * from explode(array(1, 2))\r\n\r\n+---+\r\n|col|\r\n+---+\r\n|  1|\r\n|  2|\r\n+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRule `PushDownLeftSemiAntiJoin` should not push an anti-join below an `Aggregate` when the join condition references an attribute that exists in its right plan and its left plan's child. This usually happens when the anti-join / semi-join is a self-join while `DeduplicateRelations` cannot deduplicate those attributes (in this example due to the projection of `value` to `id`).\r\n\r\nThis behaviour already exists for `Project` and `Union`, but `Aggregate` lacks this safety guard.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout this change, the optimizer creates an incorrect plan.\r\n\r\nThis example fails with `distinct()` (an aggregation), and succeeds without `distinct()`, but both queries are identical:\r\n```scala\r\nval ids = Seq(1, 2, 3).toDF(\"id\").distinct()\r\nval result = ids.withColumn(\"id\", $\"id\" + 1).join(ids, Seq(\"id\"), \"left_anti\").collect()\r\nassert(result.length == 1)\r\n```\r\nWith `distinct()`, rule `PushDownLeftSemiAntiJoin` creates a join condition `(value#907 + 1) = value#907`, which can never be true. This effectively removes the anti-join.\r\n\r\n**Before this PR:**\r\nThe anti-join is fully removed from the plan.\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan (16)\r\n+- == Final Plan ==\r\n   LocalTableScan (1)\r\n\r\n(16) AdaptiveSparkPlan\r\nOutput [1]: [id#900]\r\nArguments: isFinalPlan=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is caused by `PushDownLeftSemiAntiJoin` adding join condition `(value#907 + 1) = value#907`, which is wrong as because `id#910` in `(id#910 + 1) AS id#912` exists in the right child of the join as well as in the left grandchild:\r\n```\r\n=== Applying Rule org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.PushDownLeftSemiAntiJoin ===\r\n!Join LeftAnti, (id#912 = id#910)                  Aggregate [id#910], [(id#910 + 1) AS id#912]\r\n!:- Aggregate [id#910], [(id#910 + 1) AS id#912]   +- Project [value#907 AS id#910]\r\n!:  +- Project [value#907 AS id#910]                  +- Join LeftAnti, ((value#907 + 1) = value#907)\r\n!:     +- LocalRelation [value#907]                      :- LocalRelation [value#907]\r\n!+- Aggregate [id#910], [id#910]                         +- Aggregate [id#910], [id#910]\r\n!   +- Project [value#914 AS id#910]                        +- Project [value#914 AS id#910]\r\n!      +- LocalRelation [value#914]                            +- LocalRelation [value#914]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe right child of the join and in the left grandchild would become the children of the pushed-down join, which creates an invalid join condition.\r\n\r\n**After this PR:**\r\nJoin condition `(id#910 + 1) AS id#912` is understood to become ambiguous as both sides of the prospect join contain `id#910`. Hence, the join is not pushed down. The rule is then not applied any more.\r\n\r\nThe final plan contains the anti-join:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan (24)\r\n+- == Final Plan ==\r\n   * BroadcastHashJoin LeftSemi

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce `pyspark.errors` and error classes to unifying & improving errors generated by PySpark under a single path.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the changes below:\r\n- `python/pyspark/__init__.py`\r\n  - Add new class `PySparkException`.\r\n  - Add PySpark-specific errors that raise `PySparkException`.\r\n- `python/pyspark/sql/functions.py`\r\n  - Migrate Python built-in exceptions to PySpark-specific errors.\r\n- `pyspark/errors/error_classes.py`\r\n  - Add error classes to identify the PySpark-specific errors.\r\n- `python/pyspark/testing/utils.py`\r\n  - Add `checkError` to test errors with `error_class` and `message_parameter` instead of error message.\r\n- `python/pyspark/sql/tests/test_functions.py`\r\n  - Add & modify the tests by using `checkError`.\r\n\r\nThis is an initial PR for introducing error framework for PySpark to facilitate the error management and provide better/consistent error messages to users.\r\n\r\nWhile such an active work is being done on the [SQL side to improve error messages](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-37935), so far there is no work to improve error messages in PySpark.\r\n\r\nSo, I'd expect to also initiate the effort on error message improvement for PySpark side from this PR.\r\n\r\n**Next up** for this PR include:\r\n- Migrate more Python built-in exceptions generated by driver side into PySpark-specific errors.\r\n- Migrate the errors generated by `Py4J` into PySpark-specific errors.\r\n- Migrate the errors generated by Python worker side into PySpark-specific errors.\r\n- Migrate more error tests into tests using `checkError`.\r\n- Currently all PySpark-specific errors are defined as `PySparkException` class. As the number of PySpark-specific errors increases in the future, it may be necessary to further refine the `PySparkException` into multiple categories\r\n- Add documentation\r\n\r\nWill create the umbrella JIRA for next tasks when this PR get approved.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCentralizing error messages & introducing identified error class provides the following benefits:\r\n- Errors are searchable via the unique class names and properly classified.\r\n- Reduce the cost of future maintenance for PySpark errors.\r\n- Provide consistent & actionable error messages to users.\r\n- Facilitates translating error messages into different languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but only for error message. No API changes at all.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql import functions as F\r\n>>> F.window(\"date\", 5)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nTypeError: windowDuration should be provided as a string\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql import functions as F\r\n>>> F.window(\"date\", 5)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\npyspark.errors.PySparkException: [NOT_A_STRING] Argument 'windowDuration' should be a string, got 'int'.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy adding unittests, and existing static analysis tools

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe Spark exclude node functionality for Spark on YARN, introduced in [SPARK-26688](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26688), allows users to specify a list of node names that are excluded from resource allocation. This is done using the configuration parameter: `spark.yarn.exclude.nodes`\r\nThe feature currently works only for executors allocated via dynamic allocation. To use the feature on Spark 3.3.1, for example, one may need also to configure `spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors=0` and `spark.executor.instances=0`, therefore relying on executor resource allocation only via dynamic allocation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis proposes to extend the use of Spark exclude node functionality for YARN beyond dynamic allocation, which I believe makes it more consistent also with what the documentation reports for this feature/configuration parameter.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this allows using the executor exclude nodes feature for Spark on YARN also when not using dynamical allocation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nA unit test has been added for this + manual tests on a YARN

this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. Users should never see this because this indicates an internal, developer error.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI ran it manually locally

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `InterpretedUnsafeProjection`, use `UnsafeWriter.write`, rather than `UnsafeWriter.setNullAt`, to set null for interval fields. Also, in `InterpretedMutableProjection`, use `InternalRow.setInterval`, rather than `InternalRow.setNullAt`, to set null for interval fields.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis returns the wrong answer:\r\n```\r\nset spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage=false;\r\nset spark.sql.codegen.factoryMode=NO_CODEGEN;\r\n\r\nselect first(col1), last(col2) from values\r\n(make_interval(0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0), make_interval(17, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0))\r\nas data(col1, col2);\r\n\r\n+---------------+---------------+\r\n|first(col1)    |last(col2)     |\r\n+---------------+---------------+\r\n|16 years 2 days|16 years 2 days|\r\n+---------------+---------------+\r\n```\r\nIn the above case, `TungstenAggregationIterator` uses `InterpretedUnsafeProjection` to create the aggregation buffer and to initialize all the fields to null. `InterpretedUnsafeProjection` incorrectly calls `UnsafeRowWriter#setNullAt`, rather than `unsafeRowWriter#write`, for the two calendar interval fields. As a result, the writer never allocates memory from the variable length region for the two intervals, and the pointers in the fixed region get left as zero. Later, when `InterpretedMutableProjection` attempts to update the first field, `UnsafeRow#setInterval` picks up the zero pointer and stores interval data on top of the null-tracking bit set. The call to UnsafeRow#setInterval for the second field also stomps the null-tracking bit set. Later updates to the null-tracking bit set (e.g., calls to `setNotNullAt`) further corrupt the interval data, turning `interval 7 years 2 days` into `interval 16 years 2 days`.\r\n\r\nEven after one fixes the above bug in `InterpretedUnsafeProjection` so that the buffer is created correctly, `InterpretedMutableProjection` has a similar bug to SPARK-41395, except this time for calendar interval data:\r\n```\r\nset spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage=false;\r\nset spark.sql.codegen.factoryMode=NO_CODEGEN;\r\n\r\nselect first(col1), last(col2), max(col3) from values\r\n(null, null, 1),\r\n(make_interval(0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0), make_interval(17, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0), 3)\r\nas data(col1, col2, col3);\r\n\r\n+---------------+---------------+---------+\r\n|first(col1)    |last(col2)     |max(col3)|\r\n+---------------+---------------+---------+\r\n|16 years 2 days|16 years 2 days|3        |\r\n+---------------+---------------+---------+\r\n```\r\nThese two bugs could get exercised during codegen fallback.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-18T23:10:02Z","updated_at":"2022-12-23T00:09:10Z","closed_at":"2022-12-20T00:29:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"234f14740dbe8117a647ebc2bd390311f08a6c8f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39117/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39117/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39117/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/543090a18fa1dde4933f80273f2e25b3433ca191","head":{"label":"bersprockets:unsafe_interval_issue","ref":"unsafe_interval_issue","sha":"543090a18fa1dde4933f80273f2e25b3433ca191","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe would like to expand the `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` statement to support partition filter with new options:\r\n `MSCK REPAIR TABLE table_identifier [{ADD|DROP|SYNC} PARTITIONS [partition_spec]]`\r\n**partition_spec**:  ` ( partition_col_name = partition_col_val [ , ... ] )`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. Listing all partitions may hit the request limit in some metastore like Hive metastore.\r\n2. Partition filter can improve the performance if we only need repair the specific partitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, we update the document of `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` for the new partition filter options.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a kind of a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36940 which fixes a mistake of replacing `inputs.type`.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes it to use `PYSPARK_CODECOV` that's defined from https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/353df517f4d37aabbf807638385b0ab92dd95397/.github/workflows/build_coverage.yml#L39.\r\n\r\nSimilar approach

It stopped working for few months (https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/spark).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWill monitor the test cases.

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix `Decimal` scaling that is stored as compact long internally when scale decreased by more than 18. For example,\r\n```\r\nDecimal(1, 38, 19).changePrecision(38, 0)\r\n```\r\nproduces an exception\r\n```\r\njava.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 19\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.types.Decimal.changePrecision(Decimal.scala:377)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.types.Decimal.changePrecision(Decimal.scala:328)\r\n```\r\nAnother way to reproduce it with SQL query\r\n```\r\nsql(\"select cast(cast(cast(cast(id as decimal(38,15)) as decimal(38,30)) as decimal(38,37)) as decimal(38,17)) from range(3)\").show\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bug exists for Decimal that is stored using compact long only, it works fine with Decimal that uses `scala.math.BigDecimal` internally.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNot able to execute the SQL query mentioned above. Please note, for my use case the SQL query is generated programatically, so I cannot optimize it manually. \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, it will allow scale Decimal properly that is not currently possible due to the exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests were added. The fix affects the scale decrease only, but I decided to also include tests for scale increase as I didn't find them. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to remove the error classes `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_1041`, `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_1242` and `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_1243`, and use new one `UNRESOLVED_ROUTINE` instead. \r\n\r\nCloses #38870\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL, and unify representation of error messages.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the PR changes an user-facing error message.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to disable ANSI mode in `pyspark.sql.tests.connect.test_connect_functions` temporarily.\r\n\r\nThis PR is sort of a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38946 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39071\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere are failures in `test_connect_functions` with ANSI mode on (https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/3709431687/jobs/6288067223). I tried to fix but they are tricky to fix because Spark Connect does not respect the runtime configuration at the server side.\r\n\r\nIt is also tricky to fix the test to pass in both ANSI mode on and off. Therefore, it disables temporarily to make other tests pass. Note that PySpark tests stop in the middle if one fails.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually verified that:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nSPARK_ANSI_SQL_MODE=true ./python/run-tests --modules pyspark-connect -p 1\r\n```\r\npasses

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr introduced a new variable `VERSIONS_MAVEN_PLUGIN` for `test-dependencies.sh` to define `versions-maven-plugin` and upgrade `versions-maven-plugin`  from 2.13.0 to 2.14.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark should use the verified version of `versions-maven-plugin` to avoid unknown problems, such as those we encounter in SPARK-41522\r\n\r\nThe release notes after 2.13.0 as follows:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/mojohaus/versions/releases/tag/2.14.0\r\n- https://github.com/mojohaus/versions/releases/tag/2.14.1\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass Github

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug in `SQLShuffleWriteMetricsReporter.decRecordsWritten()`: this method is supposed to call the delegate `metricsReporter`'s `decRecordsWritten` method but due to a typo it calls the `decBytesWritten` method instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOne of the situations where `decRecordsWritten(v)` is called while reverting shuffle writes from failed/canceled tasks. Due to the mixup in these calls, the _recordsWritten_ metric ends up being _v_ records too high (since it wasn't decremented) and the _bytesWritten_ metric ends up _v_ records too low, causing some failed tasks' write metrics to look like\r\n\r\n> {\"Shuffle Bytes Written\":-2109,\"Shuffle Write Time\":2923270,\"Shuffle Records Written\":2109} \r\n\r\ninstead of\r\n\r\n> {\"Shuffle Bytes Written\":0,\"Shuffle Write Time\":2923270,\"Shuffle Records Written\":0} \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests / manual code review only. The existing SQLMetricsSuite contains end-to-end tests which exercise this class but they don't exercise the decrement path because they don't exercise the shuffle write failure paths. In theory I could add new unit tests but I don't think the ROI is worth it given that this class is intended to be a simple wrapper and it ~never changes (this PR is the first change to the file in 5 years).\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-16T04:29:04Z","updated_at":"2022-12-16T10:17:13Z","closed_at":"2022-12-16T10:16:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b87086f60b33b5c4f6e9ecb68f4721b1e72c763f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39086/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39086/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39086/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/eb37c874279f29ca7b3fc452b2cee3f94e51e1d1","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-41541","ref":"SPARK-41541","sha":"eb37c874279f29ca7b3fc452b2cee3f94e51e1d1","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remap stats and constraints against the output in logical for LogicalRDD, like we remap stats and constraints against the \"new\" output when we call newInstance.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe output in logical plan and optimized plan can be \"slightly\" different (we observed the difference of exprId), and then the query can fail due to the invalid attribute reference(s) in stats and constraints for LogicalRDD.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFor the following query:\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE table_1 (\r\n  a ARRAY<STRING>,\r\n s STRUCT<id: STRING>)\r\nUSING parquet;\r\n\r\nCREATE VIEW view_1 (id)\r\nAS WITH source AS (\r\n    SELECT * FROM table_1\r\n),\r\nrenamed AS (\r\n    SELECT\r\n     s.id\r\n    FROM source\r\n)\r\nSELECT id FROM renamed;\r\n\r\nwith foo AS (\r\n  SELECT 'a' as id\r\n),\r\nbar AS (\r\n  SELECT 'a' as id\r\n)\r\nSELECT\r\n  1\r\nFROM foo\r\nFULL OUTER JOIN bar USING(id)\r\nFULL OUTER JOIN view_1 USING(id)\r\nWHERE foo.id IS NOT NULL\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere will be the following error:\r\n```\r\nclass org.apache.spark.sql.types.ArrayType cannot be cast to class org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType (org.apache.spark.sql.types.ArrayType and org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType are in unnamed module of loader 'app')\r\njava.lang.ClassCastException: class org.apache.spark.sql.types.ArrayType cannot be cast to class org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType (org.apache.spark.sql.types.ArrayType and org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType are in unnamed module of loader 'app')\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GetStructField.childSchema$lzycompute(complexTypeExtractors.scala:108)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GetStructField.childSchema(complexTypeExtractors.scala:108)\r\n```\r\nThis is caused by the inconsistent metadata column positions in the following two nodes:\r\n* Table relation: at the ending position\r\n* Project list: at the beginning position\r\n<img width=\"1442\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/207992343-438714bc-e1d1-46f7-9a79-84ab83dd299f.png\">\r\n\r\nWhen the InlineCTE rule executes, the metadata column in the project is wrongly combined with the table output.\r\n<img width=\"1438\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/207992431-f4cfc774-4cab-4728-b109-2ebff94e5fe2.png\">\r\n\r\nThus the column `a ARRAY<STRING>` is casted as `s STRUCT<id: STRING>` and cause the error.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to fix the issue by putting the Metadata column at the end of project list, so that it is consistent with the table relation.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBug fix\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, it fixes a bug in the analysis rule `AddMetadataColumns`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove `Dynamic Resource Allocation` from K8s document because Apache Spark has been supported it.\r\nIn addition, `Dynamic Resource Allocation` can be used with 3rd-party alternatives like storing the shuffle data to S3 directly. \r\n\r\nNote that the remaining future item, `External Shuffle Service`, is also a good and independent feature.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nHere is a brief history around `spark.dynamicAllocation.shuffleTracking.enabled`.\r\n- Apache Spark 3.0.0 added it via SPARK-27963 for K8s environment.\r\n- Apache Spark 3.1.1 made K8s GA via SPARK-33005 and started to used it in K8s widely.\r\n- Apache Spark 3.2.0 started to support shuffle data recovery on the reused PVCs via SPARK-35593\r\n- Apache Spark 3.3.0 removed `Experimental` tag from it via SPARK-39322.\r\n- Apache Spark 3.4.0 will enable it by default via SPARK-39846\r\n- This PR removes `Dynamic Allocation` from `Future Work` to improve its visibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual review because this is a documentation change.","created_at":"2022-12-15T22:26:56Z","updated_at":"2022-12-16T00:43:48Z","closed_at":"2022-12-16T00:43:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a508cc6a1a1497983321d1156046b21b341bfeaf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39080/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39080/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39080/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ed80b05e93c5685aca2f3faab2af1507558ce8ed","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-41536","ref":"SPARK-41536","sha":"ed80b05e93c5685aca2f3faab2af1507558ce8ed","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"93f31cb6e5cb4fc10189672f0b7c97b7fd2e7ef3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently the usage of StateStoreConf is via [confs](https://github.com/huanliwang-db/spark/blob/7671bc975f2d88ab929e4982abfe3e166fa72e35/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/StateStoreConf.scala#L77-L78), which composes both SQL confs and extraOptions into one. The name of config for extraOptions shouldn't have to follow the name prefix of SQL conf, because it's not bound to the context of SQL conf.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAfter differentiate SQL conf and extraOptions in StateStoreConf, we should be able to adopt more use case on operator level configs by using the extraOptions.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting UT should cover the change\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-15T06:16:35Z","updated_at":"2022-12-15T23:34:31Z","closed_at":"2022-12-15T21:06:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c0b28cb166eb7f75b824845f6ce54c98fc2787e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRemoved `AND_OR` TreePattern, replaced with separate `AND` TreePattern and `OR` TreePattern.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis way we can be more fine-grained with how we match for AND/OR patterns, since in many cases we want to treat them separately.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAllow jdbc dialects to override the query used to create a table, which is convenient for different databases to implement their own syntax for creating tables\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUsers need to implement their own jdbc dialect according to the database used in the business scenario. Currently, the jdbc dialect in spark cannot customize the way of creating tables, so it cannot support the syntax of specific databases for creating tables. For example, in clickhouse, users may need to specify the name of the cluster when creating a table, using the syntax `on cluster`.\r\n`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS all_hits ON CLUSTER cluster (p Date, i Int32) ENGINE = Distributed(cluster, default, hits)`\r\nhttps://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/distributed-ddl\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest case

There is a possibility that the previous output partitions before go into this limit are sorted. The single partition shuffle approach has a correctness bug in this case: shuffle read partitions could be out of partition order and the limit exec just take the first limit rows which could lose the order thus result into wrong result. This is a shuffle so it is relatively costly. Meanwhile, to correct this bug, a native solution is to sort all the data fed into limit again, which is another overhead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo we propose a row count based AQE algorithm that optimizes this problem by two folds:\r\n\r\n1. Avoid the extra sort on the shuffle read side (or with the limit exec) to achieve the correct result.\r\n2. Avoid reading all shuffle data from mappers for this single partition shuffle to reduce shuffle cost.\r\n\r\nNote that 1. is only applied for the sorted partition case where 2. is applied for general single partition shuffle + limit case\r\n\r\nThe algorithm works as the following:\r\n\r\n1. Each mapper will record a row count when writing shuffle data.\r\n2. Since this is single shuffle partition case, there is only one partition but N mappers.\r\n3. A accumulatorV2 is implemented to collect a list of tuple which records the mapping between mapper id and the number of row written by the mapper (row count metrics)\r\n4. AQE framework detects a plan shape of shuffle plus a global limit.\r\n5. AQE framework reads necessary data from mappers based on the limit. For example, if mapper 1 writes 200 rows and mapper 2 writes 300 rows, and the limit is 500, AQE creates shuffle read node to write from both mapper 1 and 2, thus skip the left mappers.\r\n6. This is both correct for limit with the sorted or non-sorted partitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the first step to implement the idea in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-41512, which is to implement a row count accumulator that will be used to collect row count metrics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38876 that excludes BlockManagerMessages.RegisterBlockManager in MiMa compatibility check.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt fails in MiMa check presumably with Scala 2.13 in other branches. Should be safer to exclude them all in the affected branches.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nFilters copied from error messages. Will monitor the build in other branches.","created_at":"2022-12-13T12:17:44Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:49:29Z","closed_at":"2022-12-13T14:34:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aa3c56f2a49f85a59e061095ebf2b5e2d1b5f882","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39052/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39052/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39052/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9c5627e7f2da734333e0bad2d518fabd0428c993","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-41360-followup","ref":"SPARK-41360-followup","sha":"9c5627e7f2da734333e0bad2d518fabd0428c993","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror
