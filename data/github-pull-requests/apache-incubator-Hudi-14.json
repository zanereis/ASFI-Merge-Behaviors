Change Logs\r\n\r\nSimilar to KafkaSource, the source profile populated in StreamContext can be used for better parallelism and instead of using a static value for numInstantsPerFetch, a dynamic value generated based on heuristics can be used. This PR needs to be merged after [https://github.com/https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/10918]\r\n\r\nTry to fetch the latestSourceProfile always, this ensures the profile is refreshed if it's no longer valid. The implementation of source profile takes care when a profile needs to be refreshed or re-computed again.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nA new constructor added for HoodieIncrSource for emitting metrics related to source parallelism and source bytes ingested.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nMedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate

Change Logs\r\n\r\nSimilar to `KafkaSource`, the source profile populated in `StreamContext` can be used for better parallelism and instead of using a static value for numInstantsPerFetch, a dynamic value generated based on heuristics can be used.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nTestHoodieClientOnCopyOnWriteStorage and TestHoodieJavaClientOnCopyOnWriteStorage have a bunch of duplicate code, so i:  \r\n- extracted common code (with some parameterizations) to

Change Logs\r\n\r\nDuring conflict resolution between an ingestion writer and a compaction operation, if the compaction is in `inflight` state, Hudi extracts a NULL compaction plan from this `inflight` file since there is no compaction plan stored there, which further causes NPE.\r\n\r\nTherefore, during conflict resolution, we should replace `compaction.inflight` instant with `compaction.requested` instant.\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixed a bug.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nSee issue [HUDI-7699](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-7699).\r\n\r\n[HUDI-6695](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-6695) (#9260) added a AWS credentials provider to support assuming a role when syncing to Glue.\r\n\r\nWe use Hudi in a multi-tenant environment, and our customers give us delegated access to their Glue catalog.  In this multi-tenant setup it is important to use [an external ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html) to improve security when assuming IAM roles.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the STS session name is currently hard-coded to \"hoodie\".  It is helpful for us to have configurable session names so we have better tracability of what entities are creating STS sessions in the cloud.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the assumed role is configured with the `hoodie.aws.role.arn` config property.  I would like to add the following extra optional config properties, which will be used by the `HoodieConfigAWSAssumedRoleCredentialsProvider`:\r\n\r\n- `hoodie.aws.role.external.id`\r\n- `hoodie.aws.role.session.name`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo impact to any existing way of using Hudi.  It only adds more configurability to an existing feature.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNone.  The new configuration options need to be documented, but I believe that is done automatically from the config code (someone please confirm this!)\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-01T20:31:36Z","updated_at":"2024-05-08T23:17:30Z","closed_at":"2024-05-08T23:17:30Z","merged_at":"2024-05-08T23:17:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"9860e943c638c11302964d943a0d2f2f46a77051","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2346209364,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzQ2MjA5MzY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/aws-support","name":"aws-support","color":"83b722","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6615585053,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABilHRHQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:S","name":"size:S","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR adds Scala 2.13 support for Spark 3.5 integration:\r\n- Adds `scala-2.13` profile to support building Spark-related modules, i.e., `hudi-spark-bundle`, `hudi-utilities-bundle`, and `hudi-utilities-slim-bundle`, with Scala 2.13.\r\n- Changes `hudi-spark3.5.x` module to support Scala 2.13 so that Hudi Spark 3.5 integration with Scala 2.13 is supported, besides Scala 2.12.\r\n- Makes changes to Java and Scala code around conversion between Java and Scala collections, since Scala 2.13 makes several source-incompatible changes on collections (see https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/collections-migration-213.html).  The code changes are made in a way that the code can be compiled for all three Scala versions, i.e., Scala 2.11, 2.12, and 2.13.\r\n  - Creates a new Scala object, `JavaScalaConverters,` containing a few Scala conversion utils. This object can be conveniently used by Java classes to avoid code redundancy instead of directly using `scala.collection.JavaConverters`.\r\n  - Consistently imports [`scala.collection.JavaConverters._`](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.13.x/scala/collection/JavaConverters$.html) in Scala code for classes that need conversion between Java and Scala collections.  The conversion logic is explicit now, i.e., explicitly calling `.asScala` or `.asJava`, instead of implicit conversion with `scala.collection.JavaConversions._`.  Note that the logic is the same between `JavaConverters` and `JavaConversions`, so there is no logic change using explicit conversion calls.\r\n    - for example: `scalaCollection.javaCollectionApi` (implicit) -> `scalaCollection.asJava.javaCollectionApi` (explicit), `javaCollection.scalaCollectionApi` (implicit) -> `javaCollection.asScala.scalaCollectionApi` (explicit)\r\n  - Adds `toSeq` when immutable `Seq` is required as the argument type in Scala 2.13.  This is a no-op when compiled against Scala 2.12, and conversion to immutable `Seq` in Scala 2.13.  This is because, in Scala 2.13, `scala.Seq[+A]` is now an alias for `scala.collection.immutable.Seq[A]` (instead of `scala.collection.Seq[A]`) (see https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/collections-migration-213.html).\r\n  - Uses `scalaMap.getOrElse` to get config value instead of relying on conversion like `scalaMap.asJava.getOrDefault`.\r\n  - Directly uses language-native APIs when possible to avoid conversion between Scala and Java collections.\r\n  - Fixes code that does not compile in Scala 2.13.\r\n  - In `SpaceCurveSortingHelper#appendToRow`, the existing hack no longer works for Scala 2.13, so uses `Object[] currentValues = JavaScalaConverters.convertScalaListToJavaList(row.toSeq()).toArray();` to replace `Object[] currentValues = (Object[]) ((WrappedArray<Object>) row.toSeq()).array();`.  This only affects Z-Order or Hilbert space curve in Hudi clustering.\r\n- Adds CI tasks on running tests on Spark 3.5 and Scala 2.13\r\n  - Add Spark 3.5 and Scala 2.13 test profiles in `test-spark-java-tests`, `test-spark-scala-tests`, `test-spark-java17-java-tests`, `test-spark-java17-scala-tests`, `docker-java17-test`, and `validate-bundles` in GitHub CI.  The `scala-2.13` profile is validated with Spark 3.5 and the Hudi Spark 3.5 integration and `hudi-spark3.5-bundle` for Scala 2.13 are extensively tested in CI.\r\n  - Adjusts Dockerfile (`packaging/bundle-validation/base/Dockerfile`) of bundle validation image and adds a script to build the image for Spark 3.5 and Scala 2.13 (`packaging/bundle-validation/base/build_flink1180hive313spark350scala213.sh`).  The image is uploaded to the Docker Hub as `apachehudi/hudi-ci-bundle-validation-base:flink1180hive313spark350scala213`.\r\n  - Updates bundle validation scripts for GitHub CI.\r\n- Updates `README.md` to include Scala 2.13 build process.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAdds support for Hudi on Spark 3.5 with Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n`README.md` is updated to include Scala 2.13 build process.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR moves config classes and utils to the proper places:\r\n- Moves `ConfigProperty`, `EnumDescription`, `EnumFieldDescription`, `HoodieConfig`, `TypedProperties` from `hudi-common` to `hudi-io` module so that classes in `hudi-io` and `hudi-hadoop-common` modules can use config-related logic.\r\n- Moves `DFSPropertiesConfiguration` class from `hudi-common` to `hudi-hadoop-common` module.\r\n- Moves `HoodieNotSupportedException` class used by config utils from `hudi-common` to `hudi-io` module.\r\n- Moves basic config utils from `ConfigUtils` in `hudi-common` module to `ConfigUtils` in `hudi-io` module (tests are moved to `TestConfigUtils`).\r\n- Moves Hadoop-related config utils from `ConfigUtils` to `HadoopConfigUtils` in `hudi-hadoop-common` module (tests are moved to `TestHadoopConfigUtils`).\r\n- Moves Hudi-specific config utils from `ConfigUtils` to `HoodieConfigUtils` in `hudi-common` module.\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the bug that subclasses implementing `StorageConfiguration` cannot be properly (de)serialized in Spark.  The root cause is that the `#writeObject(ObjectOutputStream out)` and `#readObject(ObjectInputStream in)` for `Serializable` have to be `private`; they cannot be `public` or `protected`.  A new test is added, which fails without the fix and passes with the fix.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nBug fix.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new class hierarchy for handling merge keys in a more flexible and decoupled manner. It adds the `HoodieMergeKey` interface, along with two implementations: `HoodieSimpleMergeKey` and `HoodieCompositeMergeKey`. This design allows us to extend key-based merge strategies easily.\r\n\r\n**Motivation**\r\n\r\nThe need for introducing a new merge key handling mechanism was driven by the requirement to support different types of keys (simple and complex) without overloading the existing HoodieKey class, which is central to the write path. By segregating merge key handling into its own hierarchy, we avoid potential conflicts and keep modifications localised, improving the maintainability of the code.\r\n\r\n**Changes**\r\n\r\n1. `HoodieMergeKey`: New API to ensure consistent handling including simple keys and composite keys. It includes methods for retrieving the key and partition path.\r\n2. `HoodieSimpleMergeKey`: Wraps `HoodieKey` and implements the `HoodieMergeKey` interface for simple scenarios where the key is a string.\r\n3. `HoodieCompositeMergeKey`: Implements the  `HoodieMergeKey` interface but allows for complex types as keys, enhancing flexibility for scenarios where a simple string key is not sufficient.\r\n4. `HoodieMergeKeyBasedRecordMerger`: A new implementation of `HoodieRecordMerger` based on `HoodieMergeKey`. If the merge keys are of type `HoodieCompositeMergeKey`, then it returns the older and newer records. Otherwise, it calls the merge method from the parent class.\r\n5. `HoodieMergedLogRecordScanner`: Changes to merge based on `HoodieMergeKey`.\r\n6. Unit tests for the new merger.\r\n\r\nThese changes do not affect existing functionalities that do not rely on merge keys. It introduces additional classes that are used explicitly for new functionalities involving various key types in merging operations. This ensures minimal to no risk for existing processes.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nEnhancing the flexibility and robustness of our key-based merge strategies. It helps in keeping our codebase scalable and maintainable, allowing easy extensions and modifications in the future.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nTask: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-7639  \r\n\r\nCreated new abstract class SparkBaseIndexSupport with abstract methods `getIndexName`, `isIndexAvailable`, `computeCandidateFileNames` and `invalidateCaches` (to override it in descendants) and concrete methods `getPrunedFileNames`, `getCandidateFiles` and `shouldReadInMemory` (moved from HoodieFileIndex or XXXIndexSupport to reuse it in descendants).\r\n\r\nMade `ColumnStatsIndexSupport`, `FunctionalIndexSupport` and `RecordLevelIndexSupport` classes extend `SparkBaseIndexSupport`. Implementation of `computeCandidateFileNames` was made from corresponding if-else branches of `HoodieFileIndex.lookupCandidateFilesInMetadataTable()`. Implementations of  `getIndexName`, `isIndexAvailable` are trivial. Real implementation of `invalidateCaches` exists only for `ColumnStatsIndexSupport`.\r\n\r\nReplaced 3 individual XXXIndexSupport fields with one list of 3 SparkBaseIndexSupport items. The order of items is important: to preserve original behavior the order of indices must be: RecordLevel, Functional, ColStats.   \r\n\r\n`HoodieFileIndex.lookupCandidateFilesInMetadataTable()` is simplified to just looping through the list, checking each Index availability and (if so) computing pruned file names by XXXIndexSupport class.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces Hadoop `Configuration` class with `StorageConfiguration` in `HoodieTableMetaClient` and other core reader and writer interfaces and APIs so that `StorageConfiguration` instance is passed around instead of hadoop `Configuration` instance, to further decouple core reader logic from Hadoop dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSimplifies configuration and further decouples core reader logic from Hadoop dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n-
