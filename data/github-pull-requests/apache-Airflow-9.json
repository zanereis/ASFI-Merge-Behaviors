So the actual DR state goes running -> failed -> running -> failed.\r\n\r\nThis causes other unintended behavior, such as calling on_dag_run_failed listeners twice.\r\n\r\nThe solution just loads DR state from db before pushing TI state. However, there probably is better solution, that someone with more knowledge of SQLAlchemy might help with.\r\n\r\nLink to discussion on Airflow slack:

Fix Databricks Extra Link to See Job Run with Custom S3 Backend\r\n\r\n## Problem Addressed\r\nCloses: #45240 \r\nThis PR addresses the issue described in [#45240](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/45240), where the Databricks Extra Link for \"See Job Run\" does not work when using a custom XCom backend that writes to S3. Specifically:\r\n\r\n- The link directs to the S3 path of the XCom JSON file instead of the Databricks workspace job run URL.\r\n- This behavior makes the feature unusable in setups with custom XCom backends, such as those storing XCom values entirely in S3.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Changes\r\n\r\n- Refactored the `DatabricksJobRunLink` implementation to reliably fetch the Databricks job run URL from XCom using `XCom.get_value`.\r\n- Ensured compatibility with custom XCom backends, decoupling the link generation logic from specific backend implementations.\r\n- Improved error handling to ensure the system fails gracefully if the required XCom value is missing or malformed.\r\n- Enhanced maintainability with detailed comments and a cleaner structure.\r\n\r\n## Key Benefits\r\n\r\n- Resolves the issue of broken links when using custom XCom backends.\r\n- Ensures compatibility across a wide range of backend configurations, including setups where all XCom values are stored in S3.\r\n- Improves user experience by providing accurate links to Databricks job run details.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Validated the new implementation using a local Airflow environment with a custom XCom backend.\r\n- Confirmed that the generated links now correctly point to Databricks job run URLs, regardless of the XCom storage location.\r\n\r\n## Issue Link\r\n\r\nCloses [#45240](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/45240).\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] All unit tests pass.\r\n- [x] Code is formatted according to Airflow’s standards.\r\n- [x] Changes are backward compatible and do not break existing functionality.\r\n- [x] adding unit test \r\n\r\n## Code of Conduct\r\n\r\nI agree to follow this project's Code of

Fix Databricks Extra Link to See Job Run with Custom S3 Backend\r\n\r\n## Problem Addressed\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the issue described in [#45240](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/45240), where the Databricks Extra Link for \"See Job Run\" does not work when using a custom XCom backend that writes to S3. Specifically:\r\n\r\n- The link directs to the S3 path of the XCom JSON file instead of the Databricks workspace job run URL.\r\n- This behavior makes the feature unusable in setups with custom XCom backends, such as those storing XCom values entirely in S3.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Changes\r\n\r\n- Refactored the `DatabricksJobRunLink` implementation to reliably fetch the Databricks job run URL from XCom using `XCom.get_value`.\r\n- Ensured compatibility with custom XCom backends, decoupling the link generation logic from specific backend implementations.\r\n- Improved error handling to ensure the system fails gracefully if the required XCom value is missing or malformed.\r\n- Enhanced maintainability with detailed comments and a cleaner structure.\r\n\r\n## Key Benefits\r\n\r\n- Resolves the issue of broken links when using custom XCom backends.\r\n- Ensures compatibility across a wide range of backend configurations, including setups where all XCom values are stored in S3.\r\n- Improves user experience by providing accurate links to Databricks job run details.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Validated the new implementation using a local Airflow environment with a custom XCom backend.\r\n- Confirmed that the generated links now correctly point to Databricks job run URLs, regardless of the XCom storage location.\r\n\r\n## Issue Link\r\n\r\nCloses [#45240](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/45240).\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] All unit tests pass.\r\n- [x] Code is formatted according to Airflow’s standards.\r\n- [x] Changes are backward compatible and do not break existing functionality.\r\n\r\n## Code of Conduct\r\n\r\nI agree to follow this project's Code of

For example, when submitting a Spark job using the DataprocSubmitJobOperator, we will configure  Spark/OpenLineage integration to use the same transport configuration that Airflow integration uses.\r\n\r\n## Why ?\r\n\r\nCurrently, this process requires manual configuration by the user, as described [here](https://openlineage.io/docs/integrations/spark/configuration/airflow/). E.g.:\r\n```\r\nDataprocSubmitJobOperator(\r\n    task_id=\"my_task\", \r\n    # ... \r\n    job={ \r\n        # ...\r\n        \"spark.openlineage.transport.type\": \"http\",\r\n        \"spark.openlineage.transport.url\": openlineage_url,\r\n        \"spark.openlineage.transport.compression\": \"gzip\",\r\n        \"spark.openlineage.transport.auth.apiKey\": api_key,\r\n        \"spark.openlineage.transport.auth.type\": \"apiKey\",\r\n    } \r\n)\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnderstanding how various Airflow operators configure Spark allows us to automatically inject transport information.\r\n\r\n## Controlling the Behavior\r\n\r\nWe provide users with a flexible control mechanism to manage this injection, combining per-operator enablement with a global fallback configuration. This design is inspired by the `deferrable` argument in Airflow.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nol_inject_transport_info: bool = conf.getboolean(\r\n    \"openlineage\", \"spark_inject_transport_info\", fallback=False\r\n)\r\n```\r\nEach supported operator will include an argument like `ol_inject_transport_info`, which defaults to the global configuration value of `openlineage.spark_inject_transport_info`. This approach allows users to:\r\n\r\n1. Control behavior on a per-job basis by explicitly setting the argument.\r\n2. Rely on a consistent default configuration for all jobs if the argument is not set.\r\n\r\nThis design ensures both flexibility and ease of use, enabling users to fine-tune their workflows while minimizing repetitive configuration. I am aware that adding an OpenLineage-related argument to the operator will affect all users, even those not using OpenLineage, but since it defaults to False and can be ignored, I hope this will not pose any issues.\r\n\r\n## How?\r\nThe implementation is divided into three parts for better organization and clarity:\r\n\r\n1. **Operator's Code (including the `execute` method):**  \r\n   Contains minimal logic to avoid overwhelming users who are not actively working with OpenLineage.\r\n\r\n2. **Google's Provider OpenLineage Utils File:**  \r\n   Handles the logic for accessing Spark properties specific to a given operator or job.\r\n\r\n3. **OpenLineage Provider's Utils:**  \r\n   Responsible for creating / extracting all necessary information in a format compatible with the OpenLineage Spark integration. We are also performing modifications to the Spark properties here.\r\n\r\nFor some operators parts 1 and 2 may be in the operator's code. In general, the specific operator / provider will know how to get the spark properties and the OL will know what to inject and do the injection itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above

the build, cache of ``uv`` and ``pip`` is stored in a separate \"cache mount\" volum that is mounted during the build. This cache mount volume is preserved between builds and can be exported and imported to speed up the build process in CI - where cache is stored as artifact and can be imported in the next build.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements it:\r\n\r\n* export and import commands are added to breeze to export/import cache mount content\r\n\r\n* the cache mount content is stashed as artifact in the build after image is built and it is restored before the image is built\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

reported in #45032 the CodeMirror entry boxes are not working.\r\n\r\nThis is caused by how CodeMirror implements the entry: It is shadowing the original `<textarea>` fields in HTML. Unfortunately only via JavaScript the content of CodeMirror and HTML is in sync.\r\n...and unfortunately my hand-written JavaScript checked for NULL/empty value _before_ getting to the fields from CodeMirror. So if an object or advanced array was initialized with an empty value, it never reached the onBlur() update action.\r\nMoved the check for empty _after_ the CodeMirror field check.\r\n\r\nAlongside figured out that the same as reported for advancedArray was also happening for object, just that the object field was never correctly initialized on empty value. Fixed this as well if a field is `type=[\"object\", \"null\"]`.\r\n\r\ncloses: #45032\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-31T16:04:03Z","updated_at":"2024-12-31T19:56:57Z","closed_at":"2024-12-31T19:56:09Z","merged_at":"2024-12-31T19:56:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"6eab1f24c2fe070b6d68a1435eadaccd807ed1c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: Bug Fixes"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

Also there was a bit of discussion on the devlist about to change it for smaller screens.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The big diff is mainly the re-formatting of all UI source. The impact is caused by the one line change in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/45312/files#diff-14e4a70ab8ce4057d209267e534689fe0c3f48658095289169b396cd0c37be51R8\r\n\r\nNevertheless I was wondering why we format the (new) UI code to 80 chars?

#42561 and discarding dynamic generation of requests: #42562\r\n\r\n**Summary**\r\nThis PR introduces a central API communication mechanism for the CLI and adopts one of the broadest endpoint ranges in the API, focusing on connection commands. After several iterations to automate API call generation and handle edge cases, I couldn't achieve a fully dynamic request generation process. Instead, I landed on a structure similar to TaskSDK <-> ExecutionAPI. This approach simplifies reviews, maintains consistency across clients, and opens the door for better automation in future iterations, possibly in 3.1 or 3.2.\r\n\r\n**Implementation Details**\r\n\r\n- Added a central API communication mechanism for the CLI.\r\n- Integrated connection_command.py with unit tests.\r\n- Implemented most of the necessary CLI operations.\r\n- Data model generation from RestAPI to CLI is handled using uv.\r\n- Added decorators to cascade generic processes to operations.\r\n- Created a testing framework for CLI testing, with an example implementation for connection command.\r\n- Pending Work\r\n- Some minor features related to the connection command are still in progress and will be added in follow-up updates before 3.0.\r\n\r\n**Note:** There are two missing functionalities in this PR for the connection command. Those will be included with follow-up tasks.\r\n* #45302 (Create Default Connections)\r\n* #45303 (Overwrite the Bulk Insert Connections when Flag is passed)\r\n\r\n**Notes on task_command**\r\nWhile working on this, I realized that task_command behaves more like a local_command than a remote_command. This needs further discussion, especially regarding its integration with TaskSDK. From the CLI perspective, depending on TaskSDK seems cleaner than directly calling ExecutionAPI, it avoids duplication and keeps the structure consistent. Even if the CLI calls TaskSDK, the two-hop process to reach the ExecutionAPI feels a bit redundant. What do you think, @ashb (to all, please jump into discussion, I tagged Ash to follow up the previous discussion started on this in Slack)?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes.

on top of #45287 we also add the same capability for PROD images.

Help contains link to generate the token so that it can be easily generated.\r\n\r\n* error messages contain message text on top of error code\r\n\r\n* the --github-repository is used to determine the right github repo to use when calling the API.\r\n\r\n* PROD image platform escaping used `-` instead of `-` which make it impossible to find the artifact when looking for it.

AIP-72, there is no access to the database session from the worker process, and the runtime objects have some differences to the db models. This PR contains three commits that deal with that situation:\r\n\r\n- First commit adjusts `on_task_instance_*` listeners interface to AIP-72: drops `session` argument and makes `task_instance` argument an instance of `RuntimeTaskInstance` class, not database model\r\n- Second commit adds basic support for calling listeners in Task SDK, additionally adding some context fields that allow OL and other listeners not use DB.\r\n- Third commit adjusts OpenLineage integration to work with new interface and Task SDK.\r\n\r\nSome followup work: \r\n- wrap listener calls into `Activity` to make logging better visible from UI, and distinct from task logs\r\n- add separate interface for API to capture manual/API task changes.

We do it when the task has finished running and has reached a \"non direct\" state. Direct states are ones which need some information to transition into. For example, the reschedule state needs \"reschedule date\".\r\n\r\nCode that handles this:

to check if \"hey, have we already transitioned our TI into some state, if not, let me do it - to success or failed or something like that.\"\r\n\r\nThis PR corrects some of these things semantically

are using various caches in our build and so far - due to the way how \"standard\" caching works, PRs from forks could not effectively use the cache from main Airflow repository - because caches are not shared with other repositories - so the PRs builds could only use cache effectively when they were rebased and continued running from the same fork.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves caching strategy using \"stash\" action from the ASF. Unlike `cache` - the action uses artifacts to store cache, and that makes it possible for the stash action to use such cache uploaded from `main` canary builds in PRs coming from the fork.\r\n\r\nAs part of this change all the places where setup-python was used and breeze installed afterwards were reviewed and updated to use only breeze installation action (it already installs python) and this action has been improved to use UV caching effectively.\r\n\r\nOverall this PR should decrease setup overhead for many jobs across the CI workflow.\r\n\r\nFollow-up after #45266\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

AIP-84 testing, we noticed an HTTP 500 error when providing the same task state for the FastAPI PATCH taskinstance/{task} endpoint.\r\n\r\nIn comparison, the legacy API does not exhibit this issue. Upon investigation, the failure occurs on this [line](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/api_fastapi/core_api/routes/public/task_instances.py#L707). When the same state is provided, the [tis_altered](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/api/common/mark_tasks.py#L102) variable returns None, which results in [tis](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/api/common/mark_tasks.py#L102) also being None.\r\n\r\nFurther inspection revealed that [ti](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/api_fastapi/core_api/routes/public/task_instances.py#L705) should actually be tis. Additionally, since HTTP 404 is already handled [here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/api_fastapi/core_api/routes/public/task_instances.py#L705), it would be more appropriate to raise an HTTP 409 error in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1159\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c38161ac-2d18-4983-acc9-4423959d73d8\" />\r\n<img width=\"519\"

@shubhamraj-git has added the trigger form to the new React UI, this PR now adds the flexible trigger form - Based on the logic of the former AIP-50 implementation - using DAG ParamsDict to render form fields based on field definitions.\r\n\r\nNote that the form rendering was made as a component by intent as it will be re-used in Connection Forms in future to render connection extra fields.\r\n\r\nTo test the form rendering the following DAGs might be good candidates:\r\n- `example_bash_decorator` - has no params so should not display a specific form \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ffb9ffc-f2a5-4152-8ba1-f9375892e233)\r\n\r\n- `example_bash_operator` - has one basic parameter w/o any special thing. Simple as it can be \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afa627b9-3bcd-4599-b1ce-343c11dcc67c)\r\n\r\n- `example_params_trigger_ui` - has 4 parameters, still basic \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/428bf971-0d09-408a-94c1-6bbc812852f1)\r\n ... and with advanced section un-folded: \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/489a7c46-4651-45c5-be79-9607ca027854)\r\n\r\n- `example_params_ui_tutorial` - this is the most complex beast as it has all features as a demo that shall be supported. \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a462ee1-c081-4d87-924b-5c00d370b4f1)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aab56f59-e694-4c4c-a3da-37acd71fc85d)\r\n...and the lower section un-folded: \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b30d8da5-263b-4b9d-9b8e-f1c298992e67)\r\n\r\n\r\nScope of the PR is the UI layout and logic to render. What is missing and will be a follow-up PR is the binding and sync of the form field content with the JSON dict that is used to trigger the DAG in the \"Advanced Options\" section.","created_at":"2024-12-29T16:16:15Z","updated_at":"2025-01-27T12:48:29Z","closed_at":"2025-01-16T15:51:34Z","merged_at":"2025-01-16T15:51:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"6d16136b8fbed267c6dfa3de9004b8a1dc67fec4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172800071,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwMDcx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:new-feature","name":"type:new-feature","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: New Features"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

a long time we had used a sophisticated mechanism to speed up our CI jobs by building the images in \"pull_request_target\" workflow and pushing them to GitHub registry. That however had several drawbacks:\r\n\r\n* CI image was complex when it comes to layer setup (we had to pre- cache installed dependencies by installing them from branch tip\r\n\r\n* The pull_request_target is a very dangerous workflow, we had a number of security problems with it (and it's difficult to debug)\r\n\r\n* Caching of `pip` and `uv` was not used because it increased size of the image significantly\r\n\r\nThis PR significantly improves the caching mechanisms for the images building of several advacements that were not possible before:\r\n\r\n* The upload-artifacts@v4 action and improved stash action developed by @assignUser and published in \"apache/infrastructure-actions\" allows us to store all images (8GB per run) in artifacts rather than in registry - so we can do the image build once and share it with all the jobs.\r\n\r\n* The uv speed is \"enough\" to allow occasional installation of Airlfow locally. This allows to utilize cache-mount and locally build uv cache, rather than rely on \"remote\" cache when we are building local images for breeze. The first time you build local breeze image it will take 2-5 more minutes (depending on your network speed, but because we can utilise cache mounts, every subsequent build should be very fast - even if all dependencies change. Using uv also allows to \"always\" reinstall airflow when you build the image even if single source file changed, because with cache it takes sub-seconds to reinstall airflow and all dependencies.\r\n\r\n* the cache mounts are not included in the image size, and since we can export and import images in CI in artifacts and we do not need to rebuild them, the images shared as compressed artifacts are relatively small (2GB) - cache of `uv` is around 4GB on top of that so sharing image built in the \"build image\" job with other jobs in the same workflow is fast.\r\n\r\n* we are still using registry cache for the \"non-python\" parts of the image - both CI and breeze image build speed benefit from using the image cache for system dependencies, database clients etc.\r\n\r\n* documentation has been updated to reflect the new CI setup. The  diagrams showing the workflows of ours are no longer needed as the workflows are quite straightforward when they are looked at.\r\n\r\nFixes: #42999\r\nFixes: #43268\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

a long time we had used a sophisticated mechanism to speed up our CI jobs by building the images in \"pull_request_target\" workflow and pushing them to GitHub registry. That however had several drawbacks:\r\n\r\n* CI image was complex when it comes to layer setup (we had to pre- cache installed dependencies by installing them from branch tip\r\n\r\n* The pull_request_target is a very dangerous workflow, we had a number of security problems with it (and it's difficult to debug)\r\n\r\n* Caching of `pip` and `uv` was not used because it increased size of the image significantly\r\n\r\nThis PR significantly improves the caching mechanisms for the images building of several advacements that were not possible before:\r\n\r\n* The upload-artifacts@v4 action and improved stash action developed by @assignUser and published in \"apache/infrastructure-actions\" allows us to store all images (8GB per run) in artifacts rather than in registry - so we can do the image build once and share it with all the jobs.\r\n\r\n* The uv speed is \"enough\" to allow occasional installation of Airlfow locally. This allows to utilize cache-mount and locally build uv cache, rather than rely on \"remote\" cache when we are building local images for breeze. The first time you build local breeze image it will take 2-5 more minutes (depending on your network speed, but because we can utilise cache mounts, every subsequent build should be very fast - even if all dependencies change. Using uv also allows to \"always\" reinstall airflow when you build the image even if single source file changed, because with cache it takes sub-seconds to reinstall airflow and all dependencies.\r\n\r\n* the cache mounts are not included in the image size, and since we can export and import images in CI in artifacts and we do not need to rebuild them, the images shared as compressed artifacts are relatively small (2GB) - cache of `uv` is around 4GB on top of that so sharing image built in the \"build image\" job with other jobs in the same workflow is fast.\r\n\r\n* we are still using registry cache for the \"non-python\" parts of the image - both CI and breeze image build speed benefit from using the image cache for system dependencies, database clients etc.\r\n\r\n* documentation has been updated to reflect the new CI setup. The  diagrams showing the workflows of ours are no longer needed as the workflows are quite straightforward when they are looked at.\r\n\r\nFixes: #42999\r\nFixes: #43268\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

is the first step to move providers to separate projects inside our monorepo.\r\n\r\nAirbyte is a first provider that is separated out to a project under \"providers/<PROVIDER_ID>\" directory. This has the nice property that all files belonging to the same provider are under a single directory that is part of the Airflow workspace. For now the code is more complex because we are handling providers being in either \"old\" or \"new\" structure, but once we move old providers to the new structure, a lot of code could be removed and simplified.\r\n\r\nThe new structure for provider code is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nproviders\r\n        |- PROVIDER_ID\r\n        |            |- src\r\n        |            |    |-airflow\r\n        |            |            |- providers\r\n        |            |                       |- PROVIDER_ID\r\n        |            |- tests\r\n        |            |      |- providers\r\n        |            |                 |- PROVIDER_ID\r\n        |            |- docs\r\n        |            |     |- .latest-doc-only-changes.txt\r\n        |            |- pyproject.toml\r\n        |            |- CHANGELOG.rst\r\n        |            |- provider.yaml\r\n        |            |- README.rst\r\n        |- PROVIDER_ID2\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nPart of #44511\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR is for deprecating the page_size parameter for Google Ads API.\r\nThis is a follow-up PR for https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/43515.\r\nThe page_size parameter is deprecated for v17 and later versions.\r\nCurrently Google Ads API supports the version v16 and v16.1. However support for these versions will end at the end of February. Hence we need to deprecate this parameter first and remove it after February.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

dagrun might have a lot of task instances that are paginated. This PR adds filters to filter by state e.g. failed task instances which is similar to the filter in dagrun page now. I have also added search by task_id or task_display_name so that users can quickly get to the required task instance in a paginated setting. Slightly related issues for grid view to search by name #32239 . This also updates the URLs so that it's shareable.\r\n\r\nNotes for reviewer and self : \r\n\r\n* I reused the `searchBar` component but doesn't need advanced search as of now as it's not implemented and not useful here where search by task name is only needed. This can be added in future and the `hideAdvanced` part can be removed.\r\n\r\nScreenshot : \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c35e0c24-3174-48cd-b26c-eed942b2d3e3)\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-26T08:07:50Z","updated_at":"2025-01-20T10:20:08Z","closed_at":"2025-01-20T10:20:08Z","merged_at":"2025-01-20T10:20:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"c68083e179745aff472d43ac44de6f6363cd0166","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.
