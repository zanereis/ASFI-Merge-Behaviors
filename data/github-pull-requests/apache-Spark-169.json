the default behavior to throw exceptions by default since Apache Hadoop 3.3.1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange the stack space available to the maven compiler when running CI for building for testing purposes. The current default used is `64m`, so increasing to `256m` should be sufficient headroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere is currently a stack overflow on compilation happening in the CI environment, which is almost always due to insufficient stack space.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRunning CI. Not possible to reproduce locally, but have run in our internal

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix:\r\n- the Binder integration of pandas API on Spark, and merge them together with the existing PySpark one.\r\n- update quickstart of pandas API on Spark, and make it working\r\n\r\nThe notebooks can be easily reviewed here:\r\n\r\nhttps://mybinder.org/v2/gh/HyukjinKwon/spark/SPARK-35588-3?filepath=python%2Fdocs%2Fsource%2Fgetting_started%2Fquickstart_ps.ipynb\r\n\r\nOriginal page in Koalas: https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/10min.html\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- To show the working examples of quickstart to end users.\r\n- To allow users to try out the examples without installation easily.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo to end users because the existing quickstart of pandas API on Spark is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI manually tested it by uploading built Spark distribution to Binder.

If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR changes the unionByName with null filling logic to append new nested struct fields from the right side of the union to the schema versus sorting fields alphabetically. It removes the need to use UpdateField expressions, and just directly projects new nested structs from each side of the union with the correct schema. This changes the union'd schema from being alphabetically sorted previously to now \"left dominant\", where the fields from the left side of the union are included and then the missing ones from the right are added in the same order found originally.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCertain nested structs would cause unionByName with null filling to error out due to part of the logic for rewriting the expression tree to sort the structs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, nested struct fields will be in a different order after unionByName with null filling than before, though shouldn't cause much effective difference.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing tests based on the new StructField ordering and added a new test for the case that was broken originally.","created_at":"2021-06-23T11:18:26Z","updated_at":"2021-06-25T16:47:25Z","closed_at":"2021-06-24T16:21:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54f700d697d9cdfdf63ec83fca3985ba46d06fcf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33040/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33040/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33040/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/eb8ddfb432ee120ba617b71f77a0f3f71d56e01c","head":{"label":"Kimahriman:union-by-name-struct-order","ref":"union-by-name-struct-order","sha":"eb8ddfb432ee120ba617b71f77a0f3f71d56e01c","user":{"login":"Kimahriman","id":3536454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzY0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3536454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman","html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":358979577,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTg5Nzk1Nzc=","name":"spark","full_name":"Kimahriman/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kimahriman","id":3536454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzY0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3536454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman","html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce a new feature \"prefix match scan\" on state store, which enables users of state store (mostly stateful operators) to group the keys into logical groups, and scan the keys in the same group efficiently.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the schema of the key of state store is `[ sessionId | session.start ]`, we can scan with prefix key which schema is `[ sessionId ]` (leftmost 1 column) and retrieve all key-value pairs in state store which keys are matched with given prefix key.\r\n\r\nThis PR will bring the API changes, though the changes are done in the developer API.\r\n\r\n* Registering the prefix key\r\n\r\nWe propose to make an explicit change to the init() method of StateStoreProvider, as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef init(\r\n      stateStoreId: StateStoreId,\r\n      keySchema: StructType,\r\n      valueSchema: StructType,\r\n      numColsPrefixKey: Int,\r\n      storeConfs: StateStoreConf,\r\n      hadoopConf: Configuration): Unit\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note that we remove an unused parameter “keyIndexOrdinal” as well. The parameter is coupled with getRange() which we will remove as well. See below for rationalization.\r\n\r\nHere we provide the number of columns we take to project the prefix key from the full key. If the operator doesn’t leverage prefix match scan, the value can (and should) be 0, because the state store provider may optimize the underlying storage format which may bring extra overhead.\r\n\r\nWe would like to apply some restrictions on prefix key to simplify the functionality:\r\n\r\n* Prefix key is a part of the full key. It can’t be the same as the full key.\r\n  * That said, the full key will be the (prefix key + remaining parts), and both prefix key and remaining parts should have at least one column.\r\n* We always take the columns from the leftmost sequentially, like “seq.take(nums)”.\r\n* We don’t allow reordering of the columns.\r\n* We only guarantee “equality” comparison against prefix keys, and don’t support the prefix “range” scan.\r\n  * We only support scanning on the keys which match with the prefix key.\r\n  * E.g. We don’t support the range scan from user A to user B due to technical complexity. That’s the reason we can’t leverage the existing getRange API.\r\n\r\nAs we mentioned, we want to make an explicit change to the init() method of StateStoreProvider which would break backward compatibility, assuming that 3rd party state store providers need to update their code in any way to support prefix match scan. Given RocksDB state store provider is being donated to the OSS and plan to be available in Spark 3.2, the majority of the users would migrate to the built-in state store providers, which would remedy the concerns.\r\n\r\n* Scanning key-value pairs matched to the prefix key\r\n\r\nWe propose to add a new method to the ReadStateStore (and StateStore by inheritance), as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef prefixScan(prefixKey: UnsafeRow): Iterator[UnsafeRowPair]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe require callers to pass the `prefixKey` which would have the same schema with the registered prefix key schema. In other words, the schema of the parameter `prefixKey` should match to the projection of the prefix key on the full key based on the number of columns for the prefix key.\r\n\r\nThe method contract is clear - the method will return the iterator which will give the key-value pairs whose prefix key is matched with the given prefix key. Callers should only rely on the contract and should not expect any other characteristics based on specific details on the state store provider.\r\n\r\nIn the caller’s point of view, the prefix key is only used for retrieving key-value pairs via prefix match scan. Callers should keep using the full key to do CRUD.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR also proposes to make a breaking change, removal of getRange(), which is never be implemented properly and hence never be called properly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n* Introducing prefix match scan feature\r\n\r\nCurrently, the API in state store is only based on key-value data structure. This lacks on advanced data structures like list-like one, which required us to implement the data structure on our own whenever we need it. We had one in stream-stream join, and we were about to have another one in native session window. The custom implementation of data structure based on the state store API tends to be complicated and has to deal with multiple state stores.\r\n\r\nWe decided to enhance the state store API a bit to remove the requirement for native session window to implement its own. From the operator of native session window, it will just need to do prefix scan on group key to retrieve all sessions belonging to the group key.\r\n\r\nThanks to adding the feature to the part of state store API, this would enable state store providers to optimize the implementation based on the characteristic. (e.g. We will implement this in RocksDB state store provider via leveraging the characteristic that RocksDB sorts the key by natural order of binary format.)\r\n\r\n* Removal of getRange API\r\n\r\nBefore introducing this we sought the way to leverage getRange, but it's quite hard to implement efficiently, with respecting its method contract. Spark always calls the method with (None, None) parameter and all the state store providers (including built-in) implement it as just calling iterator(), which is not respecting the method contract. That said, we can replace all getRange() usages to iterator(), and remove the API to remove any confusions/concerns.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes for the end users & maintainers of 3rd party state store provider.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport UpCast between different field of YearMonthIntervalType/DayTimeIntervalType\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSince in our encoder we handle Period/Duration as default  YearMonthIntervalType/DayTimeIntervalType, when we use udf to handle this type, it will upcast all type of YearMonthIntervalType/DayTimeIntervalType to default YearMonthIntervalType/DayTimeIntervalType, so we need to support this.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n[[SPARK-23243](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-23243)] and [[SPARK-25341](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25341)] addressed cases of stage retries for indeterminate stage involving operations like repartition. This PR addresses the same issues in the context of push-based shuffle. Currently there is no way to distinguish the current execution of a stage for a shuffle ID. Therefore the changes explained below are necessary.\r\n\r\nCore changes are summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Introduce a new variable `shuffleMergeId` in `ShuffleDependency` which is monotonically increasing value tracking the temporal ordering of execution of <stage-id, stage-attempt-id> for a shuffle ID.\r\n2. Correspondingly make changes in the push-based shuffle protocol layer in `MergedShuffleFileManager`, `BlockStoreClient` passing the `shuffleMergeId` in order to keep track of the shuffle output in separate files on the shuffle service side.\r\n3. `DAGScheduler` increments the `shuffleMergeId` tracked in `ShuffleDependency` in the cases of a indeterministic stage execution\r\n4. Deterministic stage will have `shuffleMergeId` set to 0 as no special handling is needed in this case and indeterminate stage will have `shuffleMergeId` starting from 1.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nNew protocol changes are needed due to the reasons explained above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new unit tests in `RemoteBlockPushResolverSuite, DAGSchedulerSuite, BlockIdSuite, ErrorHandlerSuite`\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that `IntervalUtils.toDayTimeIntervalString` doesn't consider the case that a day-time interval type is casted as another day-time interval type.\r\nif data of `interval day to second` is casted as `interval hour to second`, the value of the day is multiplied by 24 and added to the value of hour. For example, `INTERVAL '1 2' DAY TO HOUR` will be `INTERVAL '26' HOUR` if it's casted.\r\nIf this behavior is intended, it should be stringified as `INTERVAL '26' HOUR` but currently, it will be `INTERVAL '2' HOUR`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nt's a bug if the behavior of cast is intended.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, because this feature is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33001 , to provide a more direct fix.\r\n\r\nThe regression in 3.1 was caused by the fact that we changed the parser and allow the parser to return CHAR/VARCHAR type. We should have replaced CHAR/VARCHAR with STRING before the data type flows into the query engine, however, `OrcUtils` is missed.\r\n\r\nWhen reading ORC files, at the task side we will read the real schema from ORC file metadata, then apply filter pushdown. For some reason, the implementation turns ORC schema to Spark schema before filter pushdown, and this step does not strip CHAR/VARCHAR. Note, for Parquet we use the Parquet schema directly in filter pushdown, and do not this have problem.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to replace the CHAR/VARCHAR with STRING when turning ORC schema to Spark schema.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\na more directly bug fix\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe introduced `SparkSession.withActive` a while ago, and we use it when we need to run some code with a certain SparkSession as the active session.\r\n\r\nSomehow we missed `SparkPlan.makeCopy`, which sets active session directly. This PR proposes to call `SparkSession.withActive` there.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nmake sure we don't change the active session unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. `makeCopy` is an internal function and I can't find a real case that this can change the active session. Mostly in an upper level, there is already a `SparkSession.withActive`, like `QueryExecution.executePhase`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nMake the ANSI flag part of expression `Cast`'s  parameter list, instead of fetching it from the sessional SQLConf.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor Views, it is important to show consistent results even the ANSI configuration is different in the running session. This is why many expressions like 'Add'/'Divide' making the ANSI flag part of its case class parameter list.\r\n\r\nWe should make it consistent for the expression `Cast`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the `Cast` inside a View always behaves the same, independent of the ANSI model SQL configuration in the current session.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n[SPARK-35852](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35852) \r\n1. When `DateType +/- DayTimeIntervalType`, It first convert the `DateType` to `TimestampType`, then `TimeAdd`. But if the `INTERVAL` Type is `DayTimeIntervalType(DAY)` , we can `ExtractANSIIntervalDays` from `DayTimeIntervalType(Day)`, then use `DateAdd` instead of `TimeAdd` to improve the impl.\r\n2. It is same as that  `DayTimeIntervalType + DateType`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nto improve the impl.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWrapping `JHashMap[BlockId, BlockStatus]` (used in `blockStatusByShuffleService`) into a new class `BlockStatusPerBlockId` which removes the reference to the map when all the persisted blocks are removed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWith https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32790 a bug is introduced when all the persisted blocks are removed we remove the HashMap which already shared by the block manger infos but when new block is persisted this map is needed to be used again for storing the data (and this HashMap must be the same which shared by the block manger infos created for registered block managers running on the same host where the external shuffle service is). \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExtending `BlockManagerInfoSuite` with test which removes all the persisted blocks then adds another

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen SQL function `to_timestamp_ntz` has invalid format pattern input, throw a runtime exception with hints for the valid patterns, instead of throwing an upgrade exception with suggestions to use legacy formatters.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAs discussed in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32995/files#r655148980, there is an error message saying\r\n\"You may get a different result due to the upgrading of Spark 3.0: Fail to recognize 'yyyy-MM-dd GGGGG' pattern in the DateTimeFormatter. 1) You can set spark.sql.legacy.timeParserPolicy to LEGACY to restore the behavior before Spark 3.0\"\r\n\r\nThis is not true for function to_timestamp_ntz, which only uses the Iso8601TimestampFormatter and added since Spark 3.2. We should improve it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, the new SQL function is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to refine the code examples for pandas-on-Spark since some of them still follows the naming for Koalas.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n```python\r\nkdf = ks.DataFrame({\"A\": [1, 2, 3], \"B\": [4, 5, 6]})\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould be refined to\r\n\r\n```python\r\npsdf = ps.DataFrame({\"A\": [1, 2, 3], \"B\": [4, 5, 6]})\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso fixed the several remaining Koalas stuffs in FAQ\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBecause we don't want to use the name \"Koalas\" in the Apache Spark anymore.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the examples in the documentation will be changed with refined names.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually built the docs and check one by one.","created_at":"2021-06-22T08:22:16Z","updated_at":"2021-06-24T06:10:07Z","closed_at":"2021-06-24T05:48:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"552c7658b5680bd1864818470816a83cd67f81b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33017/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33017/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33017/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/12ec1d69e49a727cf4bed01ee79cdf933b5c6e7b","head":{"label":"itholic:SPARK-35696","ref":"SPARK-35696","sha":"12ec1d69e49a727cf4bed01ee79cdf933b5c6e7b","user":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1cdc56c70d073ae60955a01dca0ee96336b8a594","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a rule `RemarkShuffleOrigin` in AQE queryStagePreparationRules after EnsureRequirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn some queries, we might repartition by some columns with a large partition number manually to make parallelism big enough. However if its output partitioning satisfies some other node (e.g. join/aggregate), this shuffle can not be optimized by AQE due to the shuffle origin. \r\n\r\nSo, this new rule aims to remark the shuffle origin to `ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS` as far as possible if it's safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, the plan may be changed\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix how we measure the metric `allUpdatesTimeMs` in `FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec` similar to other streaming stateful operators.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMetric `allUpdatesTimeMs` meant to capture the start to end walltime of the operator `FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec`, but currently it just [captures](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/79362c4efcb6bd4b575438330a14a6191cca5e4b/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec.scala#L121) the iterator creation time.\r\n\r\nFix it to measure similar to how other stateful operators measure. Example one [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/79362c4efcb6bd4b575438330a14a6191cca5e4b/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/statefulOperators.scala#L406). This measurement is not perfect due to the nature of the lazy iterator and also includes the time the consumer operator spent in processing the current operator output, but it should give a good signal when comparing the metric in one microbatch to the metric in another microbatch.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting UTs for regression. Due to the nature of metric type (time), it is hard to write a UT, but have manually verified.\r\n\r\n\r\nCherry-picked d4d11cf from

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR is to introduce a new sets of APIs `newTaskTempFile` and `newTaskTempFileAbsPath` inside `FileCommitProtocol`, to allow more flexible file naming of Spark output. The major change is to pass `FileNameSpec` into `FileCommitProtocol`, instead of original `ext` (currently having `prefix` and `ext`), to allow individual `FileCommitProtocol` implementation comes up with more flexible file names (e.g. has a custom `prefix`) for Hive/Presto bucketing - https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30003. Provide a default implementations of the added APIs, so all existing implementation of `FileCommitProtocol` is NOT being broken.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make commit protocol more flexible in terms of Spark output file name.\r\nPre-requisite of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30003.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes for developers  who implement/run custom implementation of `FileCommitProtocol`. They can choose to implement for the newly added API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit tests as this is just adding an API.","created_at":"2021-06-22T05:14:47Z","updated_at":"2021-06-30T04:00:15Z","closed_at":"2021-06-25T00:11:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c74c3eaa2ebb021975673c6f7f3dc3f0eb117b6f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33012/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33012/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33012/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2ec6fc61c561999aa7680d6dfa4441b1a6cf7ff5","head":{"label":"c21:commit-protocol-api","ref":"commit-protocol-api","sha":"2ec6fc61c561999aa7680d6dfa4441b1a6cf7ff5","user":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159474643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk0NzQ2NDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"c21/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/c21/spark","description":"Mirror

sum of the digits is greater than 38\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSince Spark 3.1.1, NULL is returned when casting a string with many decimal places to a decimal type. If the sum of the digits before and after the decimal point is less than 39, a value is returned. From 39 digits, however, NULL is returned.\r\nThis worked until Spark 3.0.X.\r\n\r\nCode to reproduce:\r\n\r\nA string with 2 decimal places in front of the decimal point and 37 decimal places after the decimal point returns null\r\n\r\n```\r\nval data = Seq(\r\n      \"28.9259999999999983799625624669715762138\",\r\n      \"28.925999999999998379962562466971576213\",\r\n

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMove all the bookkeeping states while scanning a Parquet column chunk into a single class `ParquetReadState`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs suggested [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32753#discussion_r655580942). To support column index in the vectorized reader path, we'll going to introduce more states to track. These are spread across different classes which make the code harder to maintain. Therefore, this proposes to move them into a single class so they can be managed better.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe current OuterReference resolution is a bit weird: when the outer plan has more than one child, it resolves OuterReference from the output of each child, one by one, left to right.\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect in the case of join, as the column name can be ambiguous if both left and right sides output this column.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this bug by resolving OuterReference with `outerPlan.resolveChildren`, instead of something like `outerPlan.children.foreach(_.resolve(...))`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nbug fix\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThe problem only occurs in join, and join condition doesn't support correlated subquery yet. So this PR only improves the error message. Before this PR, people see\r\n```\r\njava.lang.UnsupportedOperationException\r\nCannot generate code for expression: outer(t1a#291)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\na new

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, the batch and streaming file writers generate the file name a bit differently:\r\n1. The batch file writer, generates the file name with partition ID and job id (which is a unique UUID)\r\n2. The streaming file writer, generates the file name with partition ID and a fresh UUID\r\n\r\nThe reason for it is:\r\n1. The file output committer for batch creates a unique staging directory for each task attempt, so partition ID is good enough to avoid file name collision, as concurrent task attempts (task retry, speculative tasks) are well handled by the staging directory.\r\n2. The file output committe for streaming does not use staging directories. It writes files to the final path directly and uses a manifest file to track the committed files. Thus, partition ID is not sufficient to avoid file name collision. That's why we add a fresh UUID to the file name.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to unify the file name, by putting task attempt ID (which must be unique within the job) and the job ID in the file name.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nRemove confusion when people try to understand how Spark generates file names. We can further refactor the code later to move the file name generation outside of the output committer.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. The read side doesn't care about file name at all, and only care about how to list files. No backward compatibility issues.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32337, all the `.idea/` in submodules are treated as git difference again.\r\nFor example, when I open the project `resource-managers/yarn/` with IntelliJ, the git status becomes\r\n```\r\nUntracked files:\r\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\r\n\tresource-managers/yarn/.idea/\r\n```\r\nThe same issue happens on opening `sql/hive-thriftserver/` with IntelliJ.\r\nWe should ignore all the \".idea\" directories instead of the one under the root path.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMake it more friendly for developers who using IDEA for the development of submodules like yarn, hive-thriftserver, etc.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nJust infra changes.","created_at":"2021-06-21T09:35:11Z","updated_at":"2021-06-21T14:07:13Z","closed_at":"2021-06-21T14:07:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cfbeb3b635ea759c1d4d921ce6d232e2a86f945a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32998/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32998/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32998/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5fafad31ffa566ff0a93ec521d9db5ba8acf6746","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:improveIgnore","ref":"improveIgnore","sha":"5fafad31ffa566ff0a93ec521d9db5ba8acf6746","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSimilar to SPARK-35532, the main change of this pr is add `scala-2.13` profile to external/kafka-0-10-sql/pom.xml, external/avro/pom.xml and sql/hive-thriftserver/pom.xml,  the `scala-2.13` profile include dependency on `scala-parallel-collections_2.13`, then all(34) spark modules can maven test independently.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nEnsure alll(34) spark modules can be maven test independently in Scala 2.13\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIt is a trivial change to remove the reference to an incorrect configuration for push-based shuffle from a test suite. \r\nRef: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30312\r\nWith SPARK-32917, `ShuffleBlockPusher` and its test suite was introduced. `ShuffleBlockPusher` is created only when push-based shuffle is enabled and the tests in `ShuffleBlockPusherSuite` are just testing the functionality in the pusher. So there is no need to have these configs enabled in these test.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis change removes an incorrect configuration from the test suite.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis change just removes an incorrect configuration from the test suite so haven't added any UTs for it.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the cleanup logic in inheritable thread API by following Py4J cleanup logic at

seems to be because the connection dequeue `jvm._gateway_client.deque` is accessed, and modified by other threads. Therefore, the number of connections could be changed in the middle. Using `SparkContext._lock` doesn't protect because the dequeue can be updated for every Java instance access in Py4J.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use the atomic `deque.remove` in the problematic dequeue alone with try-catch on `ValueError` that copies [Py4J logic](https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/blob/master/py4j-python/src/py4j/clientserver.py#L269-L278).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo fix the flakiness in the tests, and avoid possible breakage in user application by using this API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIf users were dependent on InheritableThread with pinned thread mode on, they might have faced such issues intermittently. This PR fixes it. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested. CI should test it out too.","created_at":"2021-06-21T01:19:02Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:53:31Z","closed_at":"2021-06-21T03:00:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"da4d30b3c45e8a00dd3417e9b8f4c82b384e4941","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32989/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32989/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32989/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8b08f162e9ccf3c765851bf0a71fa9bd9944b05f","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-35834","ref":"SPARK-35834","sha":"8b08f162e9ccf3c765851bf0a71fa9bd9944b05f","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

Currently, only expressions that will definitely be always at least twice are candidates for subexpression elimination. This PR updates that logic so that expressions that are always evaluated at least once and conditionally evaluated at least once are also candidates for subexpression elimination. This helps optimize a common case during data normalization and cleaning and want to null out values that don't match a certain pattern, where you have something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntransformed = F.regexp_replace(F.lower(F.trim('my_column')))\r\ndf.withColumn('normalized_value', F.when(F.length(transformed) > 0, transformed))\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\ndf.withColumn('normalized_value', F.when(transformed.rlike(<some regex>), transformed))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn these cases, `transformed` will always be fully calculated twice, because it might only be needed once. I am proposing creating a subexpression for `transformed` in this case.\r\n\r\nIn practice I've seen a decrease in runtime and codegen size of 10-30% in our production pipelines that heavily make use of this type of logic.\r\n\r\nThe only potential downside is creating extra subexpressions, and therefore function calls, more than necessary. This should only be an issue for certain edge cases where your conditional overwhelming evaluates to false. And then the only overhead is running your conditional logic potentially in a separate function rather than inlined in the codegen. I added a config to control this behavior if that is actually a real concern to anyone, but I'd be happy to just remove the config.\r\n\r\nI also updated some of the existing logic for common expressions in coalesce and when that are actually better handled by the new logic, since you are only guaranteed to have the first value of a Coalesce evaluated, as well as the first conditional of a CaseWhen expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTo make the test suite more robust, this PR aims to add a new trait, `LocalRootDirsTest`, by refactoring `SortShuffleSuite`'s helper functions and applying it to the following:\r\n- ShuffleNettySuite\r\n- ShuffleOldFetchProtocolSuite\r\n- ExternalShuffleServiceSuite\r\n- KubernetesLocalDiskShuffleDataIOSuite\r\n- LocalDirsSuite\r\n- RDDCleanerSuite\r\n- ALSCleanerSuite\r\n\r\nIn addition, this fixes a UT in `KubernetesLocalDiskShuffleDataIOSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`ShuffleSuite` is extended by four classes but only `SortShuffleSuite` does the clean-up correctly.\r\n```\r\nShuffleSuite\r\n- SortShuffleSuite\r\n- ShuffleNettySuite\r\n- ShuffleOldFetchProtocolSuite\r\n- ExternalShuffleServiceSuite\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince `KubernetesLocalDiskShuffleDataIOSuite` is looking for the other storage directory, the leftover of `ShuffleSuite` causes flakiness.\r\n- https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/Spark%20QA%20Test%20(Dashboard)/job/spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-3.2/2649/testReport/junit/org.apache.spark.shuffle/KubernetesLocalDiskShuffleDataIOSuite/recompute_is_not_blocked_by_the_recovery/\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: task 0.0 in stage 1.0 (TID 3) had a not serializable result: org.apache.spark.ShuffleSuite$NonJavaSerializableClass\r\n...\r\norg.apache.spark.shuffle.KubernetesLocalDiskShuffleDataIOSuite.$anonfun$new$2(KubernetesLocalDiskShuffleDataIOSuite.scala:52)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the other suites, the clean-up implementation is used but not complete. So, they are refactored to use new trait.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is a test-only change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to be more robust on the underlying Hadoop library changes. Apache Spark's `copyFileToRemote` has an option, `force`, to invoke copying always and it can hit `org.apache.hadoop.fs.PathOperationException` in some Hadoop versions.\r\n\r\nFrom Apache Hadoop 3.3.1, we reverted [HADOOP-16878](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-16878) as the last revert commit on `branch-3.3.1`. However, it's still in Apache Hadoop 3.4.0.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/hadoop/commit/a3b9c37a397ad4188041dd80621bdeefc46885f2\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Apache Spark Jenkins hits a flakiness issue.\r\n- https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/Spark%20QA%20Test%20(Dashboard)/job/spark-master-test-maven-hadoop-3.2/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn/ClientSuite/distribute_jars_archive/history/\r\n-

copy command.': Operation not supported\r\nat org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileUtil.copy(FileUtil.java:403)\r\n```\r\n\r\nApache Spark has three cases.\r\n- `!compareFs(srcFs, destFs)`: This is safe because we will not have this exception.\r\n- `\"file\".equals(srcFs.getScheme)`: This is safe because this cannot be a `false` alarm.\r\n- `force=true`: \r\n    - For the `good` alarm part, Spark works in the same way.\r\n    - For the `false` alarm part, Spark is safe because we use `force = true` only for copying `localConfArchive` instead of a general copy between two random clusters.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval localConfArchive = new Path(createConfArchive(confsToOverride).toURI())\r\ncopyFileToRemote(destDir, localConfArchive, replication, symlinkCache, force = true,\r\ndestName = Some(LOCALIZED_CONF_ARCHIVE))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This preserves the previous Apache Spark behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with Maven.","created_at":"2021-06-19T21:59:13Z","updated_at":"2021-06-24T12:52:10Z","closed_at":"2021-06-21T15:28:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"21166cca730d76fee04b575ac546155839ac96af","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32983/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32983/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32983/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c6cfd65f90f9c07a4bbda9c375e0bdcde3922bae","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-35831","ref":"SPARK-35831","sha":"c6cfd65f90f9c07a4bbda9c375e0bdcde3922bae","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"86bcd1fba09d9b5e4d36a48824354aaae769fa21","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that `IntervalUtils.toYearMonthIntervalString` doesn't consider the case that year-month interval type is casted as month interval type.\r\nIf a year-month interval data is casted as month interval, the value of the year is multiplied by `12` and added to the value of month. For example, `INTERVAL '1-2' YEAR TO MONTH` will be `INTERVAL '14' MONTH` if  it's casted.\r\nIf this behavior is intended, it's stringified to be `'INTERVAL 14' MONTH` but currently, it will be `INTERVAL '2' MONTH`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's a bug if the behavior of cast is intended.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, because this feature is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nModified the tests added in SPARK-35771

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch refactors the evaluation of subexpressions.\r\n\r\nThere are two changes:\r\n\r\n1. Clean up subexpression code after evaluation to avoid duplicate evaluation.\r\n2. Evaluate all children subexpressions when evaluating a subexpression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently `subexpressionEliminationForWholeStageCodegen` return the gen-ed code of subexpressions. The caller simply puts the code into its code block. We need more flexible evaluation here. For example, for Filter operator's subexpression evaluation, we may need to evaluate particular subexpression for one predicate. Current approach cannot satisfy the requirement. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-19T19:40:14Z","updated_at":"2021-07-12T19:14:28Z","closed_at":"2021-06-30T05:14:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"01dd91c76d900c8c489332fbf80dd11468da51b9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32980/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32980/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32980/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/014bc8b69854efd98d1458a01996a9cbf2741721","head":{"label":"viirya:subexpr-eval","ref":"subexpr-eval","sha":"014bc8b69854efd98d1458a01996a9cbf2741721","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor a case like,\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nbin/spark-submit  \\\r\n--conf spark.kubernetes.file.upload.path=./ \\\r\n--deploy-mode client \\\r\n--master k8s://https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443 \\\r\n--conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=yaooqinn/spark:v20210619 \\\r\n-c spark.kubernetes.context=docker-for-desktop_1 \\\r\n--conf spark.kubernetes.executor.podNamePrefix=sparksql \\\r\n--conf spark.dynamicAllocation.shuffleTracking.enabled=true \\\r\n--conf spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=true \\\r\n--conf spark.kubernetes.driver.pod.name=abc \\\r\n--class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi examples/jars/spark-examples_2.12-3.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen `spark.kubernetes.driver.pod.name` is specific, we now get the driver pod for whatever the deploy mode is, while the driver pod only exists in cluster mode.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes error message shown when changing a column type to year-month/day-time interval type is attempted.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's for consistent behavior.\r\nUpdating column types to interval types are prohibited for V2 source tables.\r\nSo, if we attempt to update the type of a column to the conventional interval type, an error message like `Error in query: Cannot update <table> field <column> to interval type;`.\r\n\r\nBut, for year-month/day-time interval types, another error message like `Error in query: Cannot update <table> field <column>:<type> cannot be cast to interval year;`.\r\n\r\nYou can reproduce with the following procedure.\r\n```\r\n$ bin/spark-sql\r\nspark-sql> SET spark.sql.catalog.mycatalog=<a catalog implementation class>;\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE mycatalog.t1(c1 int) USING <V2 datasource implementation class>;\r\nspark-sql> ALTER TABLE mycatalog.t1 ALTER COLUMN c1 TYPE interval year to month;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nModified an existing test.","created_at":"2021-06-19T18:34:26Z","updated_at":"2021-06-20T23:35:09Z","closed_at":"2021-06-20T20:40:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4ecd6be41cfa85900256ef70ab92e3483bd90e01","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32978/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32978/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32978/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/35389a8805a1ca0571b8e57feb6b33907b99458d","head":{"label":"sarutak:err-msg-interval","ref":"err-msg-interval","sha":"35389a8805a1ca0571b8e57feb6b33907b99458d","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently the subexpression elimination in GeneraterPredicate is eager execution, add lazy evaluation mode for subexpression elimination. Fix error when the subexression elimination is inside a condition branch and the subexression depends on the other conditions.\r\nFor instance:\r\n```sql\r\n-- c1 as type of array\r\n-- +-------------------------------+\r\n-- |c1                             |\r\n-- +-------------------------------+\r\n-- |[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]|\r\n-- |[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]                |\r\n-- +-------------------------------+\r\nset spark.sql.ansi.enabled = true;\r\nset spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage = false;\r\n\r\nselect * from table_name where size(c1) > 5 and (element_at(c1, 7) = 8 or element_at(c1, 7) = 7);\r\n```\r\nIn this case, `element_at` depends on condition `size(c1) > 5`, before this pr, an exception will throw when we disable codegen.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the lazy evaluation is expensive (we need to extract a variable and check the subexpr is initialized or not before we use the subexpr), we keep subexpression eager execution in `GenerateUnsafeProjection/GenerateMutableProjection`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFix bug when subexpression elimination enabled.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd `ShippableVertexPartition` and `RoutingTablePartition` to the classes registered with Kryo in `GraphXUtils.registerKryoClasses`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`VertexRDDImpl` uses an `RDD[ShippableVertexPartition[VD]]` however, `GraphXUtils.registerKryoClasses` does not register `ShippableVertexPartition`. This means when running with `spark.kryo.registrationRequired` set to `true`, we get a \"Class is not registered\" exception. This is an issue as it prevents other unregistered classes from being discovered using `spark.kryo.registrationRequired` as the first unregistered class found halts the whole job. It also potentially decreases the serialised size of the RDD when using Kryo.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested manually by running with `spark.kryo.registrationRequired` set to `true` and verifying no \"Class is not registered\" exception was thrown.\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-19T11:09:14Z","updated_at":"2021-07-06T12:26:26Z","closed_at":"2021-07-06T12:25:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2211b5af28878e38b8d3d5a19d9fc7c5940039a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406607243,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA3MjQz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/GRAPHX","name":"GRAPHX","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32973/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32973/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32973/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4356d1283df629819cc6683b794370e13756756f","head":{"label":"matthewrj:bug/register-graphx-classes","ref":"bug/register-graphx-classes","sha":"4356d1283df629819cc6683b794370e13756756f","user":{"login":"matthewrj","id":11561974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTYxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11561974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewrj","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewrj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewrj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewrj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewrj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewrj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewrj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewrj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewrj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewrj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewrj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":378292466,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzgyOTI0NjY=","name":"spark","full_name":"matthewrj/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"matthewrj","id":11561974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTYxOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11561974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewrj","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewrj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewrj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewrj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewrj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewrj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewrj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewrj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewrj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewrj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewrj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/matthewrj/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nunionByName does not supports struct having same col names but different sequence\r\n```\r\nval df1 = Seq((1, Struct1(1, 2))).toDF(\"a\", \"b\")\r\nval df2 = Seq((1, Struct2(1, 2))).toDF(\"a\", \"b\")\r\nval unionDF = df1.unionByName(df2)\r\n```\r\nit gives the exception \r\n\r\n`org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Union can only be performed on tables with the compatible column types. struct<c2:int,c1:int> <> struct<c1:int,c2:int> at the second column of the second table; 'Union false, false :- LocalRelation [_1#38, _2#39] +- LocalRelation _1#45, _2#46`\r\n\r\nIn this case the col names are same so this unionByName should have the support to check within in the Struct if col names are same it should not throw this exception and works. \r\n\r\nafter fix we are getting the result\r\n\r\n```\r\nval unionDF = df1.unionByName(df2)\r\nscala>  unionDF.show\r\n+---+------+

name, does the union. In the case of struct this scenario was missing where all the columns  names are same but sequence is different,  so added this functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded the unit test and also done the testing through spark shell\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-19T08:55:17Z","updated_at":"2021-07-01T17:37:28Z","closed_at":"2021-07-01T17:37:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f2c22949f02e72233ae58ded33ab323138b30141","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32972/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32972/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32972/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a29df922d029988250d829dd49c28ff02f2adac3","head":{"label":"SaurabhChawla100:SPARK-35756","ref":"SPARK-35756","sha":"a29df922d029988250d829dd49c28ff02f2adac3","user":{"login":"SaurabhChawla100","id":34540906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTQwOTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34540906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100","html_url":"https://github.com/SaurabhChawla100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":235058981,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzUwNTg5ODE=","name":"spark","full_name":"SaurabhChawla100/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"SaurabhChawla100","id":34540906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTQwOTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34540906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100","html_url":"https://github.com/SaurabhChawla100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/SaurabhChawla100/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to promote `LevelDBSuite.IntKeyType` class to a normal class to isolate `InMemoryIteratorSuite` from `LevelDBSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe have the following test suite hierarchy.\r\n```\r\nDBIteratorSuite\r\n- InMemoryIteratorSuite\r\n- LevelDBIteratorSuite\r\n```\r\n\r\n`DBIteratorSuite.testRefWithIntNaturalKey` depends on `LevelDBSuite` and `InMemoryIteratorSuite` derived it. `InMemoryIteratorSuite` should not depend not `LevelDB`-specific stuff. This PR will make it sure.\r\n```\r\npublic void testRefWithIntNaturalKey() throws Exception {\r\n  LevelDBSuite.IntKeyType i = new LevelDBSuite.IntKeyType();\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen creating a record writer in an AvroDeserializer, or creating a struct converter in an AvroSerializer, look up Avro fields using a map rather than scanning the entire list of Avro fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nA query against an Avro table can be quite slow when all are true:\r\n\r\n* There are many columns in the Avro file\r\n* The query contains a wide projection\r\n* There are many splits in the input\r\n* Some of the splits are read serially (e.g., less executors than there are tasks)\r\n\r\nA write to an Avro table can be quite slow when all are true:\r\n\r\n* There are many columns in the new rows\r\n* The operation is creating many files\r\n\r\nFor example, a single-threaded query against a 6000 column Avro data set with 50K rows and 20 files takes less than a minute with Spark 3.0.1 but over 7 minutes with Spark 3.2.0-SNAPSHOT.\r\n\r\nThis PR restores the faster time.\r\n\r\nFor the 1000 column read benchmark:\r\nBefore patch: 108447 ms\r\nAfter patch: 35925 ms\r\npercent improvement: 66%\r\n\r\nFor the 1000 column write benchmark:\r\nBefore patch:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n#32513 added the case class `CommandResult` so as we can eagerly execute command locally. But we forgot to update \r\n`isLocal` of `Dataset`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`Dataset.isLocal` should consider `CommandResult`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. If the SQL plan is `CommandResult`, `Dataset.isLocal` must return true.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNo

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32429 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32644.\r\nI was thinking about creating separate PRs but decided to include all in this PR because it shares the same context, and should be easier to review together. \r\n\r\nThis PR includes:\r\n- Use `InheritableThread` and `inheritable_thread_target` in the current code base to prevent potential resource leak (since we enabled pinned thread mode by default now at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32429)\r\n- Copy local properties when `start` at `InheritableThread` is called to mimic JVM behaviour. Previously it was copied when `InheritableThread` instance was created (related to #32644).\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32429 missed one place at `inheritable_thread_target` (https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/python/pyspark/util.py#L308). More specifically, I missed one place that should enable pinned thread mode by default.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo mimic the JVM behaviour about thread lifecycle\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIdeally no. One possible case is that users use `InheritableThread` with pinned thread mode enabled.\r\nIn this case, the local properties will be copied when starting the thread instead of defining the `InheritableThread` object.\r\nThis is a small difference that wouldn't likely affect end users.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should cover this.","created_at":"2021-06-18T08:07:15Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:53:31Z","closed_at":"2021-06-20T02:48:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6eef2aa9d100170918edb3624da1aee07842b004","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32962/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32962/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32962/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/be9dd5ecc3eaa9a21958d50d7d469c40fa569c6a","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-35498-SPARK-35303","ref":"SPARK-35498-SPARK-35303","sha":"be9dd5ecc3eaa9a21958d50d7d469c40fa569c6a","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDATE/TIMESTAMP literals support years 0000 to 9999. However, internally we support a range that is much larger.\r\nWe can add or subtract large intervals from a date/timestamp and the system will happily process and display large negative and positive dates.\r\n\r\nSince we obviously cannot put this genie back into the bottle the only thing we can do is allow matching DATE/TIMESTAMP literals.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nmake spark more usable and bug fix\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, after this PR, below SQL will have different results\r\n```sql\r\nselect cast('-10000-1-2' as date) as date_col\r\n-- before PR: NULL\r\n-- after PR: -10000-1-2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nselect cast('2021-4294967297-11' as date) as date_col\r\n-- before PR: 2021-01-11\r\n-- after PR:

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe PR is proposed to support creating a Column of numpy literal value in pandas-on-Spark. It consists of three changes mainly:\r\n- Enable the `lit` function defined in `pyspark.pandas.spark.functions` to support numpy literals input.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> from pyspark.pandas.spark import functions as SF\r\n>>> SF.lit(np.int64(1))\r\nColumn<'CAST(1 AS BIGINT)'>\r\n>>> SF.lit(np.int32(1))\r\nColumn<'CAST(1 AS INT)'>\r\n>>> SF.lit(np.int8(1))\r\nColumn<'CAST(1 AS TINYINT)'>\r\n>>> SF.lit(np.byte(1))\r\nColumn<'CAST(1 AS TINYINT)'>\r\n>>> SF.lit(np.float32(1))\r\nColumn<'CAST(1.0 AS FLOAT)'>\r\n```\r\n- Substitute `F.lit` by `SF.lit`, that is, use `lit` function defined in `pyspark.pandas.spark.functions` rather than `lit` function defined in `pyspark.sql.functions` to allow creating columns out of numpy literals. \r\n- Enable numpy literals input in `isin` method\r\n\r\nNon-goal: \r\n- Some pandas-on-Spark APIs use PySpark column-related APIs internally, and these column-related APIs don't support numpy literals, thus numpy literals are disallowed as input (e.g. `to_replace` parameter in `replace` API). This PR doesn't aim to adjust all of them. This PR adjusts `isin` only, because the PR is inspired by that (as https://github.com/databricks/koalas/issues/2161). \r\n- To complete mappings between all kinds of numpy literals and Spark data types should be a followup task.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSpark (`lit` function defined in `pyspark.sql.functions`) doesn't support creating a Column out of numpy literal value.\r\nSo `lit` function defined in `pyspark.pandas.spark.functions`  is adjusted in order to support that in pandas-on-Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.\r\nBefore:\r\n```py\r\n>>> a = ps.DataFrame({'source': [1,2,3,4,5]})\r\n>>> a.source.isin([np.int64(1), np.int64(2)])\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nAttributeError: 'numpy.int64' object has no attribute '_get_object_id'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```py\r\n>>> a = ps.DataFrame({'source': [1,2,3,4,5]})\r\n>>> a.source.isin([np.int64(1), np.int64(2)])\r\n0     True\r\n1     True\r\n2    False\r\n3    False\r\n4    False\r\nName: source, dtype: bool\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFix how we measure the metric `allUpdatesTimeMs` in `FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec` similar to other streaming stateful operators.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMetric `allUpdatesTimeMs` meant to capture the start to end walltime of the operator `FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec`, but currently it just [captures](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/79362c4efcb6bd4b575438330a14a6191cca5e4b/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec.scala#L121) the iterator creation time. \r\n\r\nFix it to measure similar to how other stateful operators measure. Example one [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/79362c4efcb6bd4b575438330a14a6191cca5e4b/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/statefulOperators.scala#L406). This measurement is not perfect due to the nature of the lazy iterator and also includes the time the consumer operator spent in processing the current operator output, but it should give a good signal when comparing the metric in one microbatch to the metric in another microbatch.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting UTs for regression. Due to the nature of metric type (time), it is hard to write a UT, but have manually verified.","created_at":"2021-06-17T17:28:31Z","updated_at":"2021-06-22T05:44:09Z","closed_at":"2021-06-22T04:57:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"22c3f58dc4cdb6b868149c0e3d8fc2fa154220d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR allow the parser to parse unit list interval literals like `'3' day '10' hours '3' seconds` or `'8' years '3' months` as `YearMonthIntervalType` or `DayTimeIntervalType`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor ANSI compliance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. I noted the following things in the `sql-migration-guide.md`.\r\n\r\n* Unit list interval literals are parsed as `YearMonthIntervaType` or `DayTimeIntervalType` instead of `CalendarIntervalType`.\r\n* `WEEK`, `MILLISECONS`, `MICROSECOND` and `NANOSECOND` are not valid units for unit list interval literals.\r\n* Units of year-month and day-time cannot be mixed like `1 YEAR 2 MINUTES`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange primaryResource assertion from exact match to suffix match in case SparkSubmitSuite.`handles k8s cluster mode`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen I run SparkSubmitSuite on MacOs 10.15.7, I got AssertionError for `handles k8s cluster mode` test after pr [SPARK-35691](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35691), due to `File(path).getCanonicalFile().toURI()` function  with absolute path as parameter will return path begin with `/System/Volumes/Data` on MacOs higher tha 10.15.\r\neg.  `/home/testjars.jar` will get `file:/System/Volumes/Data/home/testjars.jar`\r\n\r\nIn order to pass UT on MacOs higher than 10.15, we change the assertion into suffix match\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

changes needed?\r\nWhen I run SparkSubmitSuite on MacOs 10.15.7, I got AssertionError for `handles k8s cluster mode` test after pr [SPARK-35691](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35691), due to `File(path).getCanonicalFile().toURI()` function  with absolute path as parameter will return path begin with `/System/Volumes/Data` on MacOs higher tha 10.15.\r\neg.  `/home/testjars.jar` will get `file:/System/Volumes/Data/home/testjars.jar`\r\n\r\nIn order to pass UT on MacOs higher than 10.15, we change the assertion into suffix match\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing
