is a draft PR since there are a couple of questions / issues that need to be addressed\r\n\r\n- I've created a separate `micrometer` package so that the code is isolated, but I can move it next to OpenTracing packages\r\n- I tried to follow the current (24.08.2023) Semantic conventions for messaging https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/semantic_conventions/messaging/ but need help with all the remaining `TODO:` comments as far as tags are concerned\r\n- Where should we put the documentation to this integration?\r\n- How do we deal with scoping (span scopes) when consuming batches? How often do we process a single message? If we left an open scope for a span how would users then close it? Can it be done automatically?\r\n\r\n### Which Issue(s) This PR Fixes\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/7055\r\n\r\n### Brief Description\r\n\r\nAdds Micrometer Observation support via the `ConsumeMessageHook` and `SendMessageHook`\r\n\r\n### How Did You Test This Change?\r\n\r\nI've added 2 tests that reuse OpenTracing's testing approach.

The loop iterates over the subscription table to check if a topic exists in the subscription list. This results in a time complexity of O(n) for each iteration.\r\n\r\nTo optimize the time complexity, we can introduce an additional HashSet to store the new topics. By doing so, we can perform a constant time (O(1)) lookup instead of iterating over the subscription table in the loop. This will significantly reduce the time complexity of the loop.\r\n\r\n### How Did You Test This Change?\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to ensure the code quality of Apache RocketMQ, we expect every pull request to have undergone thorough testing. -->\r\n\r\nNo

runserver.sh when enabling `--enable-proxy` this allow JVM `heap` and `gc` configuration using broker's settings instead of other common serverices'(proxy,namenode, etc). our main purpose, like the filename `mqbroker` suggest, is to start broker (which embeds a proxy), so use broker's config is reasonable\r\n\r\nchinese version\r\nmqbroker的--enable-proxy选项是启动内嵌了proxy的broker，而不是内嵌broker的proxy，而且broker的工作量和重要程度大于proxy，所以使用broker的gc和heap配置更合适\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Did You Test This Change?\r\n\r\nafter the change, started broker using configs in  runbroker.sh and work well\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-10T04:29:01Z","updated_at":"2023-10-19T08:22:42Z","closed_at":"2023-08-17T07:31:14Z","merged_at":"2023-08-17T07:31:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"2b93e1e32fd458d9df2091e89ea259ddd4d54061","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/7150/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/7150/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/7150/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/c2ba8fac35143884942ada057124f381bf687b20","head":{"label":"iamgd67:iamgd67-patch-1","ref":"iamgd67-patch-1","sha":"c2ba8fac35143884942ada057124f381bf687b20","user":{"login":"iamgd67","id":4783681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODM2ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4783681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamgd67","html_url":"https://github.com/iamgd67","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamgd67/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamgd67/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamgd67/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamgd67/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamgd67/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamgd67/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamgd67/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamgd67/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamgd67/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":676806891,"node_id":"R_kgDOKFdA6w","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"iamgd67/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"iamgd67","id":4783681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODM2ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4783681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamgd67","html_url":"https://github.com/iamgd67","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamgd67/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamgd67/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamgd67/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamgd67/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamgd67/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamgd67/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamgd67/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamgd67/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamgd67/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/iamgd67/rocketmq","description":"Apache

However, in the future, there is a desire to exert strict control over message types. Message type validation has already been implemented in the Proxy component. To support the transition of existing users to the Proxy architecture, a new message type called \"MIXED\" should be introduced to facilitate the migration process.\r\n\r\n### How Did You Test This Change?\r\n\r\n1. create a topic with MIXED message type.\r\n2. send messages with different message type, and verify the result.\r\n3. receive messages in currently and orderly mode, and verify the result.\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-02T08:44:12Z","updated_at":"2023-08-03T08:15:10Z","closed_at":"2023-08-03T08:10:24Z","merged_at":"2023-08-03T08:10:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"3bdabf703b883fea6181df8889c08d1e91202291","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/7110/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/7110/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/7110/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/496fa3ce2eb55f9c24ee17317243a17912aeb5f0","head":{"label":"dingshuangxi888:feature/add_mixed_topic_type","ref":"feature/add_mixed_topic_type","sha":"496fa3ce2eb55f9c24ee17317243a17912aeb5f0","user":{"login":"dingshuangxi888","id":5010921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTA5MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5010921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888","html_url":"https://github.com/dingshuangxi888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"ab61183030f4f230619ea539cbd2cb977234208b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":75164823,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NTE2NDgyMw==","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"apache/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq","description":"Apache

Therefore, we need to re-add the information for that protocol during forwarding.\r\n\r\n### How Did You Test This Change?\r\n\r\n1. Start proxy server with multi protocol.\r\n2. Open the proxy protocol server.\r\n3. Send message with grpc protocol.\r\n4. Judge the proxy protocol is pass to the grpc server.\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-21T09:16:20Z","updated_at":"2023-07-21T12:28:59Z","closed_at":"2023-07-21T12:28:59Z","merged_at":"2023-07-21T12:28:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"90c5382aee07879a80309f257f04114201ccaac6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/7062/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/7062/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/7062/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/e1509460769fbc1ed1cdb36701245d6b0c59d449","head":{"label":"dingshuangxi888:feature/forward_haproxy_message","ref":"feature/forward_haproxy_message","sha":"e1509460769fbc1ed1cdb36701245d6b0c59d449","user":{"login":"dingshuangxi888","id":5010921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTA5MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5010921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888","html_url":"https://github.com/dingshuangxi888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"af993d28e20922d91862f0911e59f748dcb64e6a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":75164823,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NTE2NDgyMw==","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"apache/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq","description":"Apache
