incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it).

Changed</h2>\n<p>This version upgrades the native libraries to Snappy 1.1.9. Currently, only a limited number of platforms are supported, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Win32/64 (Only Intel)</li>\n<li>Mac64 (Intel, M1, M2). We no longer support Mac32</li>\n<li>Linux32, 64 (Intel, Arm), arm, armv6, armv7</li>\n<li>android-arm32</li>\n<li>ppc64le, ppc64</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you need more platform support, send a PR to build a native library with a <a href=\"https://github.com/dockcross/dockcross\">docker-based cross compiler</a> (See Makefile and Makefile.common for the reference). If a cross compiler for your platform is not available, create a PR with a native library built with <code>make native</code> command.</p>\n<h2>🚀 Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add uncompressDoubleArray that takes offset and length <a href=\"https://github.com/ashley-taylor\"><code>@​ashley-taylor</code></a> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/xerial/snappy-java/issues/307\">#307</a>)</li>\n<li>Build native library for Snappy 1.1.9 <a href=\"https://github.com/xerial\"><code>@​xerial</code></a> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/xerial/snappy-java/issues/380\">#380</a>)</li>\n<li>Upgrade to snappy-1.1.9 <a href=\"https://github.com/xerial\"><code>@​xerial</code></a> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/xerial/snappy-java/issues/379\">#379</a>)</li>\n<li>Add Java 17 build test to GitHub action <a href=\"https://github.com/wangyum\"><code>@​wangyum</code></a> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/xerial/snappy-java/issues/346\">#346</a>)</li>\n<li>Adding ppc64le support in Travis <a href=\"https://github.com/Abhijit-Mane\"><code>@​Abhijit-Mane</code></a> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/xerial/snappy-java/issues/286\">#286</a>)</li>\n<li>Build on riscv64 <a href=\"https://github.com/zinovya\"><code>@​zinovya</code></a> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/xerial/snappy-java/issues/283\">#283</a>)</li>\n<li>Upgrade bitshuffle to 0.3.4 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/xerial/snappy-java/issues/380\">#380</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>👋 Deprecated</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed pure-java support <a href=\"https://github.com/xerial\"><code>@​xerial</code></a> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/xerial/snappy-java/issues/381\">#381</a>) because it may cause data corruption.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-09T15:04:40Z","updated_at":"2023-04-09T23:34:03Z","closed_at":"2023-04-09T23:34:02Z","merged_at":"2023-04-09T23:34:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"5cd5b32b8ba74f27411aeecc4ae95f3963794d86","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12040/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12040/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12040/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d202de0e928b28d4227d8263bda133ec34697fbc","head":{"label":"JunJieLiu51520:feature/3.2_beta7_rest_formdata_fix","ref":"feature/3.2_beta7_rest_formdata_fix","sha":"d202de0e928b28d4227d8263bda133ec34697fbc","user":{"login":"JunJieLiu51520","id":42363259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzYzMjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42363259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520","html_url":"https://github.com/JunJieLiu51520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"bd57066e711bad5f8d7fd6067ac4b29d04266fed","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-07T09:02:47Z","updated_at":"2023-04-10T01:32:57Z","closed_at":"2023-04-09T23:24:37Z","merged_at":"2023-04-09T23:24:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"9a4aadd9173a57dd9a44c1429637f34f78784848","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12033/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12033/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12033/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9214fbbc4564b28446b339102d0c33103d26f782","head":{"label":"xieshouyu:feature/fixSvcDiscoveryUpdateError","ref":"feature/fixSvcDiscoveryUpdateError","sha":"9214fbbc4564b28446b339102d0c33103d26f782","user":{"login":"xieshouyu","id":29672850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjcyODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29672850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu","html_url":"https://github.com/xieshouyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":580273067,"node_id":"R_kgDOIpZDqw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"xieshouyu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xieshouyu","id":29672850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjcyODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29672850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu","html_url":"https://github.com/xieshouyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xieshouyu/dubbo","description":"Apache

is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-06T09:37:03Z","updated_at":"2024-03-01T06:05:44Z","closed_at":"2024-03-01T06:05:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7098e629a496ea0295566b7c36bbd1a7fa3050a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12026/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12026/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12026/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ee901c74614d8bb4fa3f70b6554e2e5a8715cb9e","head":{"label":"Phixsura:feat/triple_meta_service","ref":"feat/triple_meta_service","sha":"ee901c74614d8bb4fa3f70b6554e2e5a8715cb9e","user":{"login":"Phixsura","id":100568933,"node_id":"U_kgDOBf6PZQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100568933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phixsura","html_url":"https://github.com/Phixsura","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phixsura/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phixsura/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phixsura/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phixsura/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phixsura/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phixsura/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phixsura/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phixsura/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phixsura/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.3","ref":"3.3","sha":"71cc51bf69df6bcef5222fd95ab8d8fe2f805c6d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-06T03:11:41Z","updated_at":"2023-04-11T11:00:03Z","closed_at":"2023-04-11T11:00:03Z","merged_at":"2023-04-11T11:00:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"7facd5be19ea80ffee05172931b589ddc90ace8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12022/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12022/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12022/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/10f705c9da2463dcae734fa3cf70676d90c0bf66","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0406_fix_oom","ref":"0406_fix_oom","sha":"10f705c9da2463dcae734fa3cf70676d90c0bf66","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-05T13:39:31Z","updated_at":"2023-04-06T10:37:44Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12021/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12021/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12021/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5ef09e4fb7833a2d62af919fe5d2cafd468c53b0","head":{"label":"mytang0:refactor-triple-queue-flush","ref":"refactor-triple-queue-flush","sha":"5ef09e4fb7833a2d62af919fe5d2cafd468c53b0","user":{"login":"mytang0","id":29346818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzQ2ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29346818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0","html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":596634531,"node_id":"R_kgDOI4_row","name":"dubbo","full_name":"mytang0/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mytang0","id":29346818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzQ2ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29346818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0","html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-05T06:15:16Z","updated_at":"2023-06-29T02:51:38Z","closed_at":"2023-06-29T02:51:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a062c44f04906b4531da536d4f86c21127977088","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12018/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12018/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12018/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b2160ca89d606a81f98a8ca9406d48838ea2fa05","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0405_exception","ref":"0405_exception","sha":"b2160ca89d606a81f98a8ca9406d48838ea2fa05","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-04T09:09:48Z","updated_at":"2023-04-05T06:17:12Z","closed_at":"2023-04-05T06:17:12Z","merged_at":"2023-04-05T06:17:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"04d4825b88f990f8b0e04bfb63edd04621c30861","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12015/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12015/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12015/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/fcf610b70084674f0a7857a1bc361614be09a488","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0404_npe","ref":"0404_npe","sha":"fcf610b70084674f0a7857a1bc361614be09a488","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-04T07:57:16Z","updated_at":"2023-04-15T03:50:24Z","closed_at":"2023-04-15T03:47:13Z","merged_at":"2023-04-15T03:47:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"559b13ae2e2281d4f01ae88701e7e0fef31bcb5f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12013/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12013/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12013/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d4d935839f652560a82da6aacf7103cfd9e873ca","head":{"label":"conghuhu:cgq","ref":"cgq","sha":"d4d935839f652560a82da6aacf7103cfd9e873ca","user":{"login":"conghuhu","id":56248584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56248584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu","html_url":"https://github.com/conghuhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":544346536,"node_id":"R_kgDOIHIRqA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"conghuhu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"conghuhu","id":56248584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56248584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu","html_url":"https://github.com/conghuhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/conghuhu/dubbo","description":"Apache

This has been fixed by improving Hazelcast’s service loader mechanism. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/18119\">#18119</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v3.12.12</h2>\n<p>3.12.12 release</p>\n<h2>v3.12.11</h2>\n<p>3.12.11 release</p>\n<h2>v3.12.10</h2>\n<p>3.12.10 release</p>\n<h2>3.12.9</h2>\n<p>This document includes the new features, enhancements and fixed issues for <strong>Hazelcast IMDG v3.12.9</strong>, Open Source edition release.</p>\n<h1>Enhancements</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Updated the <code>hazelcast-kubernetes</code> dependency version to 1.5.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/17256\">#17256</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added support for tenant control when creating caches. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/17121\">#17121</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a race issue when creating a cache (JCache) using multiple methods with the same cache name but having different keys. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/17284\">#17284</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed an issue where the repeated calls of <code>executeOnKeys()</code> in Hazelcast clients for <code>NATIVE</code> maps was causing a continuous increase in the used memory and exhaustion of the memory pool after a while. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/17271\">#17271</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a performance issue when using paging predicates with JDK 8. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/17213\">#17213</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed an issue where <code>ReliableTopicMessageListener</code> was firing a warning when the client is shutting down. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/17070\">#17070</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed an issue where the client-side <code>HazelcastInstance</code> was not throwing a configuration exception when there is a conflict between the dynamic and static configurations. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/16927\">#16927</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Contributors</h1>\n<p>We would like to thank the contributors from our open source community who worked on this release:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-02T09:38:13Z","updated_at":"2023-04-06T11:32:22Z","closed_at":"2023-04-06T11:32:21Z","merged_at":"2023-04-06T11:32:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"03647452d5a9b4dc2acafc531f4f26e45fef556c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11984/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11984/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11984/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d32b943b18d81c966c5656a1bc8a4a5da352af19","head":{"label":"EarthChen:tri-security-check","ref":"tri-security-check","sha":"d32b943b18d81c966c5656a1bc8a4a5da352af19","user":{"login":"EarthChen","id":20179425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5NDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20179425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen","html_url":"https://github.com/EarthChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"f57dbcfae3506d499600d255cfb044ff097324f8","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-02T03:21:54Z","updated_at":"2023-04-02T12:11:51Z","closed_at":"2023-04-02T12:11:50Z","merged_at":"2023-04-02T12:11:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"f32da50a3baec660c993fc86972a9841b4924a4d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11983/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11983/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11983/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1dd2d772f84ee18912400dc070e8d23566163658","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0402_fix_default","ref":"0402_fix_default","sha":"1dd2d772f84ee18912400dc070e8d23566163658","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request updates several demo use cases in the `dubbo-demo` module that were using deprecated APIs. \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n- Remove org.apache.dubbo.demo.consumer.Application#runWithRefer()\r\n- Remove org.apache.dubbo.demo.provider.Application#startWithExport()  \r\n- Remove com.apache.dubbo.demo.graalvm.consumer.Application#runWithRefer() \r\n- Rename 'com' to 'org' \r\n- Remove org.apache.dubbo.demo.graalvm.provider.Application#startWithExport() \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large,

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-30T08:33:12Z","updated_at":"2023-03-31T07:48:36Z","closed_at":"2023-03-31T07:48:36Z","merged_at":"2023-03-31T07:48:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"aeb2bec1d7e6a754eb6d6f52831a2c6dab76391f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11971/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11971/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11971/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f9a5b347eb24919c3f7870ecd377ea4ccf53c7c9","head":{"label":"Phixsura:opt_docs_and_uts","ref":"opt_docs_and_uts","sha":"f9a5b347eb24919c3f7870ecd377ea4ccf53c7c9","user":{"login":"Phixsura","id":100568933,"node_id":"U_kgDOBf6PZQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100568933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phixsura","html_url":"https://github.com/Phixsura","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phixsura/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phixsura/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phixsura/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phixsura/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phixsura/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phixsura/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phixsura/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phixsura/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Phixsura/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"8fc267ba9b3cd6e519a0771b4eb80f623d3b6fa6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n1. optimize ThreadlessExecutor\r\n2. tri response works on user threads\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original `ThreadlessExecutor` uses the `LinkedBlockingQueue.take` method to wait response, which will reduce the performance of the benchmark.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-29T09:08:21Z","updated_at":"2023-04-02T06:03:31Z","closed_at":"2023-04-02T06:03:30Z","merged_at":"2023-04-02T06:03:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"17887768d0ea4dbea61d0df0b86e72d58805777d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11962/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11962/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11962/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/66728db149c28cfb53645b1f2758076edd3c3a60","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0329_initialize","ref":"0329_initialize","sha":"66728db149c28cfb53645b1f2758076edd3c3a60","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-29T08:58:02Z","updated_at":"2023-03-29T09:43:19Z","closed_at":"2023-03-29T08:58:10Z","merged_at":"2023-03-29T08:58:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"0e57b84b6ec89261cf8a108e9045736d422c18be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11961/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11961/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11961/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5ff46b905e1e33117b7af1cc4b58581a246493e4","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0329_disable_some_test","ref":"0329_disable_some_test","sha":"5ff46b905e1e33117b7af1cc4b58581a246493e4","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

[dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-29T04:44:54Z","updated_at":"2023-04-04T07:55:33Z","closed_at":"2023-03-30T02:23:24Z","merged_at":"2023-03-30T02:23:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"8fc267ba9b3cd6e519a0771b4eb80f623d3b6fa6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11959/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11959/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11959/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/10b76bb0a2b63b25bcf6845558f1c9f80bd7cb3b","head":{"label":"conghuhu:tracing-enable","ref":"tracing-enable","sha":"10b76bb0a2b63b25bcf6845558f1c9f80bd7cb3b","user":{"login":"conghuhu","id":56248584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56248584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu","html_url":"https://github.com/conghuhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":544346536,"node_id":"R_kgDOIHIRqA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"conghuhu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"conghuhu","id":56248584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56248584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu","html_url":"https://github.com/conghuhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/conghuhu/dubbo","description":"Apache

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-28T14:44:27Z","updated_at":"2023-03-30T02:16:52Z","closed_at":"2023-03-30T02:16:51Z","merged_at":"2023-03-30T02:16:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"547678e6848db8117d804d82e4e341eb13ed9cbe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11956/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11956/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11956/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b9bd3dbbd9435853a3394c627678c5b20197fdb7","head":{"label":"songxiaosheng:feature/add_counter","ref":"feature/add_counter","sha":"b9bd3dbbd9435853a3394c627678c5b20197fdb7","user":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":534049587,"node_id":"R_kgDOH9TzMw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"songxiaosheng/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng/dubbo","description":"Apache

this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue.

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-27T06:32:15Z","updated_at":"2023-03-27T09:23:36Z","closed_at":"2023-03-27T09:22:10Z","merged_at":"2023-03-27T09:22:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"5a2114d1406882c1d2859bcc692fd22190a957e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11938/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11938/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11938/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/517ae8029229e9893785863bbe57b24f78cb001f","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0327_executor","ref":"0327_executor","sha":"517ae8029229e9893785863bbe57b24f78cb001f","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-27T01:59:44Z","updated_at":"2023-03-27T04:23:53Z","closed_at":"2023-03-27T04:23:53Z","merged_at":"2023-03-27T04:23:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"58d97e5b73d5f9f4353dc26afaf1e50d0ce22981","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11932/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11932/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11932/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/eeaa52d886dbeb73cb720729794e3a858387d71c","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/native_ci","ref":"fix/native_ci","sha":"eeaa52d886dbeb73cb720729794e3a858387d71c","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-26T08:17:57Z","updated_at":"2023-06-03T09:12:32Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11928/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11928/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11928/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f0026f206d701f4c7cc643bdd836b02514fe75da","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0308_cert","ref":"0308_cert","sha":"f0026f206d701f4c7cc643bdd836b02514fe75da","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-26T04:52:47Z","updated_at":"2023-03-28T03:44:15Z","closed_at":"2023-03-28T03:05:25Z","merged_at":"2023-03-28T03:05:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"88853e0177ab252ea49cd3bf814b79c69f2de042","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11927/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11927/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11927/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/cc0c858685785350320369d93449e6f8b4a079f4","head":{"label":"icodening:bugfix_writequeue","ref":"bugfix_writequeue","sha":"cc0c858685785350320369d93449e6f8b4a079f4","user":{"login":"icodening","id":42876375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODc2Mzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42876375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening","html_url":"https://github.com/icodening","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":460051832,"node_id":"R_kgDOG2vVeA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"icodening/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"icodening","id":42876375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODc2Mzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42876375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening","html_url":"https://github.com/icodening","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/icodening/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n- `DubboClientObservationConvention` and `DubboServerObservationConvention` singleton\r\n- rename `DubboObservation` to `DubboObservationDocumentation`\r\n- add `dubbo-common` to `dubbo-spring-boot-observability-starter`\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

(usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-25T09:31:21Z","updated_at":"2023-03-29T02:14:44Z","closed_at":"2023-03-29T02:14:43Z","merged_at":"2023-03-29T02:14:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"a804501d267a2e4c9d3d2775e8c456f441426d57","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11923/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11923/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11923/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/44d709d298cc280b0418da0fca6e1db227cc1113","head":{"label":"robin977:3.2-dev","ref":"3.2-dev","sha":"44d709d298cc280b0418da0fca6e1db227cc1113","user":{"login":"robin977","id":8486672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin977","html_url":"https://github.com/robin977","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin977/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin977/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin977/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin977/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin977/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin977/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin977/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin977/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin977/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":618342839,"node_id":"R_kgDOJNsptw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"robin977/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"robin977","id":8486672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin977","html_url":"https://github.com/robin977","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin977/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin977/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin977/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin977/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin977/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin977/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin977/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin977/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robin977/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/robin977/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-25T06:33:15Z","updated_at":"2023-04-07T13:19:03Z","closed_at":"2023-04-07T13:19:02Z","merged_at":"2023-04-07T13:19:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"2324db0805c78e684e50e542396fa04104769527","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11922/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11922/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11922/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1d7ee32e7b7919b619ff45a214d8a33f61f51642","head":{"label":"songxiaosheng:fix/observability_not_support_micrometer_low_version","ref":"fix/observability_not_support_micrometer_low_version","sha":"1d7ee32e7b7919b619ff45a214d8a33f61f51642","user":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":534049587,"node_id":"R_kgDOH9TzMw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"songxiaosheng/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation
