We can implement a very fast DFS traversal, but then we lose the nice expand/collapse functionality. Unfortunately I don't know an easy way to compute the number of paths in a graph (I think there's a big prize for that), so I'm solving this the old fashioned way: try the complicated method, and if it takes too long, fall back on the quick one.\n\nHere's what happens:\n1. The default timeout is 1 second (I thought that was a reasonable wait for most graphs)\n2. We try to run the full recursion. If it finishes in less than 1 second, the resulting tree view has full expand/collapse functionality\n3. But if the full recursion times out, then it falls back on a quick DFS recursion that will display a full tree, but can't be dynamically expanded\n4. If a URL parameter `force_expand` is passed, then the timeout is removed and the system will compute the full recursion no matter how long it takes.

PR is about making it easier for users to take advantage of @neovintage's great work in #267!\n\nThe problem is that existing users aren't given a clear path to enable encryption. The warning in #279 suggests that they should install the `cryptography` library, but that's not enough -- encryption only works if they also put a `fernet_key` in their `airflow.cfg` files. Airflow will create a default key for a fresh install, but anyone with an existing `airflow.cfg` file is out of luck unless they change it themselves -- and by definition, anyone seeing #279 already has an `airflow.cfg`!\n\nSo this PR does two things: if the user has `cryptography` installed but no `fernet_key` option, it prompts them to create an encryption key at import (and provides a helper function `generate_fernet_key()`). It also expands the warning from #279 to explain that just installing `cryptography` isn't enough, users must add the key.\n\nNew warning message:\n\n```\nIn [1]: import airflow\nWARNING:root:\n\nYour system supports encrypted passwords for Airflow connections but is\ncurrently storing them in plaintext! To turn on encryption, add a\n\"fernet_key\" option to the \"core\" section of your airflow.cfg file,\nlike this:\n\n    [core]\n    fernet_key = <YOUR FERNET KEY>\n\nYour airflow.cfg file is located at: /Users/jlowin/airflow/airflow.cfg.\nIf you need to generate a fernet key, you can run this code:\n\n    from airflow.configuration import generate_fernet_key\n    generate_fernet_key()\n```\n\nUpdated UI message:\n![screen shot 2015-08-25 at 4 04 48

PR is a little odd and digs into some weird Python 3 idiosyncrasies. It started as a simple fix for the `dag.pickle()` method (which I think incorrectly referenced `DAG` instead of `DagModel`) but the DAG comparisons kept failing. \n\nTurns out Python 3 completely ignores  `__cmp__` and requires rich comparison operators instead (`__eq__`, `__lt__`, etc.). And if you implement `__eq__`, you have to also implement `__hash__`, which is when I remembered that in Python 3, `hash()` is randomized and is not stable across interpreters. Usually this only manifests as unexpected dict orderings, but here it would mean that unpickled DAGs would have different `hash` values from each other and from the original -- hardly good when we are even storing the hash in the DagPickle table!\n\nSo this PR does a few things:\n1. replaces `__cmp__` for `DAG` and `BaseOperator` with rich comparison ops using the `functools.total_ordering` decorator to add missing ones. \n   \n   Note: `__cmp__` didn't have a way to express \"not equal\" so it returned negative numbers which actually implied \"less than\". So to maintain compatibility, I put the comparison logic in `__lt__` rather than `__eq__`. This shouldn't have any practical impact but might look surprising.\n2. precalculates a `hash` value for `DAG` and `BaseOperator`. By recalculating and storing the hash, unpickled DAGs are all guaranteed to have the same hash no matter what interpreter loads them. \n   \n   This is far from a perfect solution but Python 3 has basically made it impossible to use hashes as a stable key, so at least this will work across versions. A better and more stable solution would be to define a unique combination of attributes and use their md5 digest as the hash value (for tasks, `task_id`, `dag_id`, and `type` should work; for DAGs, maybe `dag_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `owner` and the md5 hashes of all its tasks). I have NOT done that here, though.\n3. Updates `DAG.pickle()` to work properly. This was the original

seem to be some of the last blocks to running simple DAGs in Airflow on Python 3. It's very possible edge cases still exist, so Python 3 users will have to be vigilant and submit patches as they find them. For example, one of these fixes would only be an issue if the database had no rows, and then only because the result [None] was compared to an int... which is okay in Python 2 but not in Python 3. Ugh.\n\nAlso, it would be great if it were possible to run future testing in both Python 2 and Python 3 environments, since regressions can be introduced inadvertently.

#182 and also #170. Would love thoughts on utility/names, as well as any easier ways of getting the execution_date (see below).\n\nThe `TaskValue` class extends the idea of Variables without polluting the Variable namespace (I have a feeling people are using Variables for some specific purpose).\n\n`TaskValues` are json-serialized values that are keyed by `task_id`, `dag_id`, and an arbitrary `key`. They can be recalled by matching on any (or all) of those fields. For example, `TaskValue.get(task_id='my_task')` would return the most recent value saved by any task called `my_task`, whereas `TaskValue.get(task_id='my_task', dag_id='my_dag')` would limit the query to only `my_task` run in `my_dag`. At least one of `task_id`, `dag_id`, or `key` must be passed.\n\nIn addition, the `execution_date` must be passed to make sure that values from the future aren't passed (this could happen, for example, during a backfill). If there's a better way to get the execution date, please let me know.\n\nExample:\n\n``` python\nimport airflow\nfrom airflow.models import TaskValue\nimport datetime\n\ndefault_args = {'owner': 'airflow'}\n\ndag = airflow.DAG(\n    'simple_dag',\n    start_date=datetime.datetime(2015, 1, 1),\n    default_args=default_args)\n\n### These functions show how to set/get values from Python functions\n\n# this function stores a value: [1, 2, 3]\ndef func_1(**kwargs):\n    TaskValue.set(\n        task_instance=kwargs['task_instance'],\n        key='val from func 1',\n        value=[1, 2, 3])\n\n# this function recalls the value by key\ndef func_2(**kwargs):\n    val = TaskValue.get(\n        execution_date=kwargs['execution_date'],\n        key='val from func 1')\n\n    assert val == [1, 2, 3]\n\n# this function recalls the value by task_id\ndef func_3(**kwargs):\n    val = TaskValue.get(\n        execution_date=kwargs['execution_date'],\n        task_id='func_1')\n\n    assert val == [1, 2, 3]\n\n### This class shows how to use values in any Operator's execute() method\nclass MyOperator(airflow.models.BaseOperator):\n\n    def execute(self, context):\n\n        # set a value\n        self.set_value(key='val from my op', value=[1, 2, 3], context=context)\n\n        # recall the value\n        val1 = self.get_value(key='val from my op', context=context)\n\n        # recall the value from task 'func_1'\n        val2 = self.get_value(task_id='func_1', context=context)\n\n        assert val1 == [1, 2, 3]\n        assert val2 == [1, 2, 3]\n\n\n# Set up the DAG\n\nf1 = airflow.operators.PythonOperator(\n    task_id='func_1', provide_context=True, dag=dag, python_callable=func_1)\nf2 = airflow.operators.PythonOperator(\n    task_id='func_2', provide_context=True, dag=dag, python_callable=func_2)\nf3 = airflow.operators.PythonOperator(\n    task_id='func_3', provide_context=True, dag=dag, python_callable=func_3)\nf4 = MyOperator(task_id='func_4', dag=dag)\n\nf1.set_downstream([f2, f3, f4])\n```\n","created_at":"2015-08-06T20:49:58Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T19:40:45Z","closed_at":"2015-08-14T21:00:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f9ac6b69b2ed0f7d3b450b598f507d6f07d0650f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/232/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/232/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/232/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/bffa24daefa84aae523290435c8484294403076d","head":{"label":"jlowin:task_values","ref":"task_values","sha":"bffa24daefa84aae523290435c8484294403076d","user":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1264bde6d6b8f12f1ff0223d3166c4b296d4a1a3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

PR attempts to generalize the PrestoCheckOperator family so it can be used with other backends besides Presto.\n\nThere are two parts to this...\n1. the first part creates a baseSqlHook to ensure that other hooks can easily be used in this CheckOperator\n2. the second part separates out the check implementation from presto.\n\nI decided to make the operators an abstract class so we can continue the pattern of not instantiating the hook until we are going to execute, rather than creating them in the constructor. Alternatively, I could have passed in a hook and a list of hook parameters but that felt pretty icky.\n\nI had some problems running the tests on my local machine -- I'm not sure if there are some other instructions that are needed but my hive tests and other external dependencies were failing.\n","created_at":"2015-07-17T00:14:11Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T19:40:58Z","closed_at":"2015-07-23T16:41:08Z","merged_at":"2015-07-23T16:41:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"30e0f0ea23bd09916ea2047c9b3be05c410ee3d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/146/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/146/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/146/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/4184beaedf93c04d7250de79ff5c77914d2a157a","head":{"label":"smarden1:generalize-check-operator","ref":"generalize-check-operator","sha":"4184beaedf93c04d7250de79ff5c77914d2a157a","user":{"login":"smarden1","id":549155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTE1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/549155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarden1","html_url":"https://github.com/smarden1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarden1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarden1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarden1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarden1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarden1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarden1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarden1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarden1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarden1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39166628,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTE2NjYyOA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"smarden1/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"smarden1","id":549155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTE1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/549155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarden1","html_url":"https://github.com/smarden1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarden1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarden1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarden1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarden1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarden1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarden1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarden1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarden1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarden1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/smarden1/airflow","description":"AirFlow
