Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe current flink does not have a good msg notification mechanism from JM to TM tasks. In order to get rid of this, we introduced two kind of fs based messages on the JM:\r\n\r\n1. the view_storage_conf file to keep remote fs view storage properties\r\n2. the ckp_metadata used for pending instants fetching in light-weight way\r\n\r\nBoth of the two messages work well on single-writer scenario, we just use a fixed name file path for these files/directories. But in multi-writer scenario, writing into same name msg file incurs conflicts, the msg file finally got corrupted and the existing writers can be impacted.\r\n\r\nIn HUDI-5673, we introduced an option 'write.client.id' for manual conflict resolution, the user needs to config the client id for each of the multi-writers. This is valid but very inconvenient in production practice.\r\n\r\nIn this patch, we try to auto infer the client id when the job is submitted from the client machine. On start up, each job tries to scramble for a client id first, after the job is running, the coordinator on JM would try to send a heartbeat message for its client id in a fixed time interval(by default 1 minute).\r\n\r\nThe heartbeat is mainly used for deciding whether the job that holds the client id is still alive, if not, the client id can be recycled and reused.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nno impact\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the archival configs for the metadata table, `hoodie.metadata.keep.min.commits` and `hoodie.metadata.keep.max.commits`, since the metadata table's archival operation is tied to the corresponding data table's timeline and these two configs do not provide much value.  The PR makes the metadata table's archival operation to use the same configs, `hoodie.keep.min.commits` and `hoodie.keep.max.commits`, as the data table.\r\n\r\nA few tests are also adjusted since the number of commits to retain in metadata table is 3, so the `hoodie.keep.min.commits` should be larger than 3.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nRemoves `hoodie.metadata.keep.min.commits` and `hoodie.metadata.keep.max.commits`, which users should not tweak anyway.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ]

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFor the kafka source, when pulling data from kafka, the default parallelism is the number of kafka partitions.\r\nThere are cases: \r\n1. Pulling large amount of data from kafka (eg. maxEvents=100000000), but the # of kafka partition is not enough, the procedure of the pulling will cost too much of time\r\n2. There is huge data skew between kafka partitions, the procedure of the pulling will be blocked by the slowest partition\r\n\r\nto solve those cases, I add a parameter `hoodie.deltastreamer.kafka.per.batch.maxEvents` to control the maxEvents in one kafka batch, default Long.MAX_VALUE means not trun this feature on.\r\n\r\nHere is the comparison of this feature:\r\nmax executor core is 128.\r\nbefore: \r\n<img width=\"1370\" alt=\"image\"

Change Logs\r\n\r\nReads from bootstrapped tables in spark are around twice as slow as from regular tables. Even if the bootstrap is a full bootstrap, which is just a bulk insert. This means that bootstrap relation is reading regular files much slower than HadoopFsRelation. To fix this, we only query the bootstrap base files and don't read and merge the skeleton files. This means that you cannot read hudi metadata columns when using the bootstrap fast path.\r\n\r\nIntroduces new config `hoodie.bootstrap.data.queries.only` that is disabled by default. To read the Hudi metadata fields, it needs to be set to false.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSpark query performance only 5-10% slower than regular hudi tables instead of 100% slower.\r\n\r\n### Risk level

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAvoid missing data during incremental queries\r\n\r\nThe reason for missing data is that the timeline used by `MergeOnReadIncrementalRelation` only contain completed instants.When the incremental range contains an incomplete compaction plan, `fsView.getLatestMergedFileSlicesBeforeOrOn` in `collectFileSplits` will filter out some fileslices.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\ncause wrong query results\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen lazy fetching partition path & file slice for HoodieFileIndex is used, date cannot be converted to the correct string representation. \r\n\r\nThis is the case as Spark store dates as an integer value representing the number of days that has past since 1970-01-01.\r\n\r\nWhen rebuilding the partition path, this FS path could be rebuilt wrongly causing a partition to be empty, and hence, the query result to be empty/incorrect.\r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO DataSourceStrategy: Pruning directories with: isnotnull(country#80), isnotnull(par_date#81),(country#80 = ID),(par_date#81=19415)\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nINFO AbstractTableFileSystemView: Building file system view for partition (country=ID/par_date=19415) \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFixes clustering on bootstrapped tables with and without row-writer. There are two issues:\r\n1. Clustering strategy added bootstrap as well as source paths to the glob paths. This was causing an error, as mentioned in HUDI-5891, while building file index. There is no need to add source path as that is handled in `HoodieBootstrapRDD`.\r\n2. Sometimes the path will have scheme and sometimes it will be without scheme, so getting the relative partition path based was buggy. Corrected that in `HoodieBootstrapRelation`.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo public API change. A bug fix for the bootstrap path.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAdd `hudi-client-common` and `hudi-java-client` to `hudi-trino-bundle`. Trino-Hudi connector makes use of the write client for some tests. Eventually, we want to add write capabilities as well. Have tested the bundle in [Trino](https://github.com/codope/trino/blob/upgrade-hudi-0.13.0/plugin/trino-hudi/pom.xml).\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThe bundle size grows by 1mb from 39.5 to 40.5mb.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCreate instant time after setCommitTimezone if table exists, or after initTable if no table exists.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nWhen hoodie.table.timeline.timezone is UTC in not UTC LOCAL timezone, timeline action does not progress.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nThe commit timezone is not updated when HoodieSparkSqlWriter write method.\r\n\r\nFor example, the LOCAL time zone is KST (UTC+9), and even if 'hoodie.table.timeline.timezone' is UTC, the first instance time is created as LOCAL (KST) and then initTable is called.\r\n\r\nThen, the second instant time after initTable is created in UTC and waits because the first instant time is 9 hours ahead of the second KST.\r\n\r\nAnd in other situations, a write method started when there is already an initialized table does not call setCommitTimezone.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nLooks like clustering dag is triggered twice even in happy path. This patch attempts at fixing the issue. This follows similar approach as [compactor](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/bf2e64caa6b49c5fed561bdae500e0dbf60e51ef/hudi-client/hudi-client-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/table/action/compact/RunCompactionActionExecutor.java#L99), where before triggering the dag for the first time, we persist the rdd. And then once the CommitMetadata is returned from table to the client, client clones the commitMetadata and any further execution will not trigger the dag again.  \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nClustering will by robust and will not result in spurious data files (which might eventually cleaned up anyways).\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, the savepoint-related call procedure can only take the table name stored in the catalog in Spark SQL.  This does not work with the temporary view (`df. createOrReplaceTempView(name)`).  See #7589 .  Relevant call procedure are:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncall create_savepoint(table => 'table_name', commit_time => 'commit_time')\r\ncall show_savepoints(table => 'table_name')\r\ncall delete_savepoint(table => 'table_name', instant_time => 'commit_time')\r\ncall rollback_to_savepoint(table => 'table_name', instant_time => 'commit_time')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the support of using the base path of a Hudi table (with `path` parameter) for savepoint call procedure in Spark SQL.  Users can now run the following new call procedure:\r\n```\r\ncall create_savepoint(path => '/table/path', commit_time => 'commit_time')\r\ncall show_savepoints(path => '/table/path')\r\ncall delete_savepoint(path => '/table/path', instant_time => 'commit_time')\r\ncall rollback_to_savepoint(path => '/table/path', instant_time => 'commit_time')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImproves the usability of savepoint call procedure in Spark SQL.  New unit tests are added to make sure the call procedure works.  The new call procedure parameter is also tested in local spark-shell.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nSee HUDI-5974.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-22T23:14:37Z","updated_at":"2023-03-24T13:45:59Z","closed_at":"2023-03-24T13:45:58Z","merged_at":"2023-03-24T13:45:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"6916803f7a40a4af57e7de1f927a4d5aa7025e32","assignee":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XuQianJin-Stars","id":10494131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk0MTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10494131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars","html_url":"https://github.com/XuQianJin-Stars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719800718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAwNzE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:critical","name":"priority:critical","color":"B60205","default":false,"description":"production

Change Logs\r\n\r\n_Describe context and summary for this change. Highlight if any code was copied._\r\n- More details in the ticket https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-5967\r\n- Currently, when performing a full table scan during a streaming read (when the start commit is EARLIEST), the partitions are collected into a HashSet which randomizes the order\r\n- For time partitioned tables, this means that Flink pipeline could read a partition for hour 11, advance the watermarks, then read the partitions for hour 8, and consider every record to be late\r\n- So, we use a TreeSet to force partition level ordering for full table scans\r\n- Test requires Hadoop to be running locally, similar to TestFileIndex tests\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n_Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact._\r\n- Since the full table scan only occurs once at the beginning of the streaming read, the partitions only need to be sorted once so there shouldn't be any performance impact\r\n- Reading from time partitioned tables should now work properly with time-sensitive Flink pipelines\r\n- Reading from non-time partitioned tables should have no functional impact \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n- None\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

before filing an issue_**\r\n\r\n- Have you gone through our [FAQs](https://hudi.apache.org/learn/faq/)?  yes\r\n\r\n- Join the mailing list to engage in conversations and get faster support at dev-subscribe@hudi.apache.org. sent email please help involve me in\r\n\r\n- If you have triaged this as a bug, then file an [issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/HUDI/issues) directly.\r\n\r\n**Describe the problem you faced**\r\n\r\nMy company is using deltastreamer to ingestion data from kafka to hdfs, the old hudi table type is COW. But the write latency of the COW table is much higher than MOR table. So we are going to migrate the COW tables to MOR.\r\nAccording to the [FAQ](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/faq/#how-to-convert-an-existing-cow-table-to-mor), we can change the existing COW table to MOR by just changing the `hoodity.table.type` property.\r\nBut there is one issue for continuing deltastreamer of MOR table on the existing path, the checkpoint from old COW table will lost, so there may be dataloss in such cases.\r\n\r\nI find the cause of the checkpoint loss.\r\nIn the refreshTimeline method, when table is MOR only get checkpoint from deltacommits, that's why the checkpoint loss when migrating COW to MOR https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/ce21873f332f1728ad46aeb066777e49456ef522/hudi-utilities/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/utilities/deltastreamer/DeltaSync.java#L325\r\n\r\nSimply put, I want the deltastreamer to support migrate hudi table directly by a parameter\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\ndeltastreamer offer a parameter `--migration-type` to support migrate existing COW table to MOR, \r\nthe value of the param `--migration-type` can be: \r\n1. NONE (default no migration)\r\n2. COW_TO_MOR\r\n3. MOR_TO_COW (TODO)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-20T17:32:32Z","updated_at":"2023-10-11T09:26:32Z","closed_at":"2023-04-04T08:37:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"89ac67d116accfe00294dc29194a25eb12c84de6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/8247/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/8247/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/8247/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/05723c875468112b99e882bf2930177efcb3c6ce","head":{"label":"waitingF:deltastreamer-support-migrate-cow-to-mor","ref":"deltastreamer-support-migrate-cow-to-mor","sha":"05723c875468112b99e882bf2930177efcb3c6ce","user":{"login":"waitingF","id":19326824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzI2ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19326824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waitingF","html_url":"https://github.com/waitingF","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waitingF/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waitingF/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waitingF/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waitingF/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waitingF/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waitingF/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waitingF/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waitingF/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waitingF/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":616589200,"node_id":"R_kgDOJMBnkA","name":"hudi","full_name":"waitingF/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"waitingF","id":19326824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzI2ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19326824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waitingF","html_url":"https://github.com/waitingF","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waitingF/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waitingF/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waitingF/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waitingF/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waitingF/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waitingF/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waitingF/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waitingF/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waitingF/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/waitingF/hudi","description":"Upserts,

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAddressing the issues discussed in https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/8065\r\n\r\nJIRA Ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-5973\r\n\r\n@nsivabalan's thinking:\r\n\r\nThe issue is. getSourceScheme in case of SchemaRegistry provider is not idempotent. even within a single batch of write, if we call getSourceSchema multiple times, it could return latest schema from the schema registry. ideally we want it to return one schema for one batch of write.\r\nso, the fix is to add a new api to Source abstract class called \"clearCaches\" or \"cleanupResources\". also add similar apis to SchemaProvider. and so within source.clearCaches, we will call schemaProvider.clearCaches.\r\nIncase of SchemaRegistryProvider, for every batch, we will fetch from remote schema registry and cache is locally. for subsequent calls to getsourceSchema, we will be returning the same value. before moving onto next batch of consume, we will have to call clearCaches which will invalidate the local cache of source schema.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- Now, when a `SchemaRegistryProvider` calls `getSourceSchema`, it will cache its first schema called, and then re-use the cache on subsequent calls, to maintain that schema per batch.\r\n- Also added a clearCarches method to the KafkaSource as per @nsivabalan's recommendation, to \"invalidate the local cache of source schema.\"\r\n- This should ensure that when the Source is instantiated and (KafkaSource and it's children) call `fetchNewData()`, any existing cache from the `SchemaProvider` (Currently only `SchemaRegistryProvider`) will be dropped.\r\n- Added tests for new functionality -- passing locally\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nDeltastreamer jobs running in --continuous mode sometimes fail to gracefully evolve their schemas if the schema registry schema's change mid-way through a batch (presents itself as transient failures, as discussed in the above GH Issue)\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-20T17:16:17Z","updated_at":"2024-03-09T06:55:45Z","closed_at":"2024-03-09T06:55:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"08162fc2fc5e9c6ee6bd0c1e5def5b6fe1b6c380","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2284138194,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjg0MTM4MTk0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/schema-and-data-types","name":"schema-and-data-types","color":"ceae46","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2719800718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAwNzE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:critical","name":"priority:critical","color":"B60205","default":false,"description":"production

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the logic of inferring the cleaning policy based on clean configs.  By default, the cleaning policy is determined based on one of the following configs explicitly set by the user (at most one of them can be set; otherwise, KEEP_LATEST_COMMITS cleaning policy is used):\r\n- \"hoodie.cleaner.commits.retained\": the KEEP_LATEST_COMMITS cleaning policy is used;\r\n- \"hoodie.cleaner.hours.retained\": the KEEP_LATEST_BY_HOURS cleaning policy is used;\r\n- \"hoodie.cleaner.fileversions.retained\": the KEEP_LATEST_FILE_VERSIONS cleaning policy is used.\r\n\r\nNow setting only one of the configs above automatically switches the cleaning policy.  Setting `hoodie.cleaner.policy` is deprecated.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nA user does not need to explicitly set the cleaning policy alongside the one of following configs: \"hoodie.cleaner.commits.retained\", \"hoodie.cleaner.hours.retained\", or \"hoodie.cleaner.fileversions.retained\".\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nDocs

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFixing a corner case bug where compaction in MDT could get triggered w/ partially failed commit in DT. \r\n\r\nCurrently the logic to deduce pending instants in MDT is as below\r\n\r\na = we get latest completed delta commit from MDT.\r\nFind any inflights in DT timeline **before** {a}\r\nand if we don't find any such inflights, we will go ahead and may be compact MDT.\r\n\r\nBut what incase the latest delta commit in MDT succeeded in MDT, but failed in DT. so, it could potentially result in triggering compaction in MDT which should not happen. \r\n\r\nSo, the right fix is \r\n\r\na = we get latest completed delta commit from MDT.\r\nFind any inflights in DT timeline **before or equals** to {a}\r\nThis should take care of not triggering compaction in MDT when here are inflights in DT which is committed to MDT. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nStabilizes metadata table. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFixes clustering on bootstrapped tables. There are two issues:\r\n1. Clustering strategy added bootstrap as well as source paths to the glob paths. This was causing an error, as mentioned in HUDI-5891, while building file index. There is no need to add source path as that is handled in `HoodieBootstrapRDD`.\r\n2. Sometimes the path will have scheme and sometimes it will be without scheme, so getting the relative partition path based was buggy. Corrected that in `HoodieBootstrapRelation`.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo public API change. A bug fix for the bootstrap path.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR applies the logic of automatically inferring the key generator to Deltastreamer, besides Spark Datasource, Streaming and SQL writers.\r\n- Moves the logic of automatic inference of key generator to `KeyGenUtils`\r\n- Refactors `HoodieSparkKeyGeneratorFactory` for code reuse\r\n- Fixes `DeltaSync` for using the inferred key generator\r\n- Removes unnecessary key generator configs in a few tests\r\n- Adds new tests in `TestHoodieDeltaStreamer`, `TestKeyGenUtils`, and `TestHoodieSparkKeyGeneratorFactory` to verify the automatic inference of the key generator type and class name.\r\n\r\nNote that, if either `hoodie.datasource.write.keygenerator.class` or `hoodie.datasource.write.keygenerator.type` is explicitly set, the configured value takes precedence to be in effect (`hoodie.datasource.write.keygenerator.class` first, and then `hoodie.datasource.write.keygenerator.type`) and the inference of the key generator is not triggered.\r\n \r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nIn most of cases (for key generator types of SIMPLE, COMPLEX, and NON_PARTITION), user does not need to explicitly specify the key generator type anymore.  The key generator is automatically inferred.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNeed to update the documentation around code examples where key generator configs are not mandatory: HUDI-6008\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-14T07:33:39Z","updated_at":"2023-03-31T20:33:29Z","closed_at":"2023-03-31T20:33:29Z","merged_at":"2023-03-31T20:33:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"f051c8a0ad21b3c56fb363517705c0634b8bfe4e","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719846715,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODQ2NzE1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/writer-core","name":"writer-core","color":"3F460E","default":false,"description":"Issues
