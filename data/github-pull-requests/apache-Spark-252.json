would execute successfully only when this task was reScheduled to a executor whose host is same to this oversize shuffle partition block.\r\n\r\nHowever, if there are more than one oversize(>2GB) shuffle partitions block, this task would never execute successfully and it may cause the failure of application.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I propose a new method to fetch shuffle block, it would fetch multi times when the relative shuffle partition block is oversize.\r\n\r\nThe simple brief introduction:\r\n\r\n1. Set a shuffle fetch threshold(SHUFFLE_FETCH_THRESHOLD) to Int.MaxValue(2GB)\r\n2. Set a parameter spark.shuffle.fetch.split to control whether enable fetch large partition multi times\r\n3. When creating mapStatus, caucluate the segemens of shuffle block (`Math.ceil(size /SHUFFLE_FETCH_THRESHOLD )`), and only record the segment number which is large than 1.\r\n4. Define a new BlockId type, `ShuffleBlockSegmentId`, used to identifiy the fetch method.\r\n5. When spark.shuffle.fetch.split is enabled,  send ShuffleBlockSegmentId message to shuffleService instead of ShuffleBlockId message.\r\n6. For a ShuffleBlockId, use a sequence of ManagedBuffers to present received blocks instead of a ManagedBuffer.\r\n7. In ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator,  create a PriorityBlockQueue for a ShuffleBlockId to store the fetched SegmentManagedBuffer, when all segments of a ShuffleBlockId are fetched,  take  relative sequence of managedBuffers(which are ordered by segmentId) as a successResult for a ShuffleBlockID.\r\n8. In the shuffle serivice side, if the blockId of openBlocks is a ShuffleBlockSegmentId,  response a segment managedBuffer of block , if the blockId is a ShuffleBlockId response a whole managedBuffer of block as before.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nmanual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor simplicity, all `LambdaVariable`s are globally unique, to avoid any potential conflicts. However, this causes a perf problem: we can never hit codegen cache for encoder expressions that deal with collections (which means they contain `LambdaVariable`).\r\n\r\nTo overcome this problem, `LambdaVariable` should have per-query unique IDs. This PR does 2 things:\r\n1. refactor `LambdaVariable` to carry an ID, so that it's easier to change the ID.\r\n2. add an optimizer rule to reassign `LambdaVariable` IDs, which are per-query unique.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFlush batch timely for pandas UDF.\r\n\r\nThis could improve performance when multiple pandas UDF plans are pipelined.\r\n\r\nWhen batch being flushed in time, downstream pandas UDFs will get pipelined as soon as possible, and pipeline will help hide the donwstream UDFs computation time. For example:\r\n\r\nWhen the first UDF start computing on batch-3, the second pipelined UDF can start computing on batch-2, and the third pipelined UDF can start computing on batch-1.\r\n\r\nIf we do not flush each batch in time, the donwstream UDF's pipeline will lag behind too much, which may increase the total processing time.\r\n\r\nI add flush at two places:\r\n* JVM process feed data into python worker. In jvm side, when write one batch, flush it\r\n* VM process read data from python worker output, In python worker side, when write one batch, flush it\r\n\r\nIf no flush, the default buffer size for them are both 65536. Especially in the ML case, in order to make realtime prediction, we will make batch size very small. The buffer size is too large for the case, which cause downstream pandas UDF pipeline lag behind too much.\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n* This is only applied to pandas scalar UDF.\r\n* Do not flush for each batch. The minimum interval between two flush is 0.1 second. This avoid too frequent flushing when batch size is small. It works like:\r\n```\r\n        last_flush_time = time.time()\r\n        for batch in iterator:\r\n                writer.write_batch(batch)\r\n                flush_time = time.time()\r\n                if self.flush_timely and (flush_time - last_flush_time > 0.1):\r\n                      stream.flush()\r\n                      last_flush_time = flush_time\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n### Benchmark to make sure the flush do not cause performance regression\r\n#### Test code:\r\n```\r\nnumRows = ...\r\nbatchSize = ...\r\n\r\nspark.conf.set('spark.sql.execution.arrow.maxRecordsPerBatch', str(batchSize))\r\ndf = spark.range(1, numRows + 1, numPartitions=1).select(col('id').alias('a'))\r\n\r\n@pandas_udf(\"int\", PandasUDFType.SCALAR)\r\ndef fp1(x):\r\n    return x + 10\r\n\r\nbeg_time = time.time()\r\nresult = df.select(sum(fp1('a'))).head()\r\nprint(\"result: \" + str(result[0]))\r\nprint(\"consume time: \" + str(time.time() - beg_time))\r\n```\r\n#### Test Result:\r\n\r\n params        | Consume time (Before) | Consume time (After)\r\n------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------\r\nnumRows=100000000, batchSize=10000 | 23.43s | 24.64s\r\nnumRows=100000000, batchSize=1000 | 36.73s | 34.50s\r\nnumRows=10000000, batchSize=100 | 35.67s | 32.64s\r\nnumRows=1000000, batchSize=10 | 33.60s | 32.11s\r\nnumRows=100000, batchSize=1 | 33.36s | 31.82s\r\n\r\n### Benchmark pipelined pandas UDF\r\n#### Test code:\r\n```\r\nspark.conf.set('spark.sql.execution.arrow.maxRecordsPerBatch', '1')\r\ndf = spark.range(1, 31, numPartitions=1).select(col('id').alias('a'))\r\n\r\n@pandas_udf(\"int\", PandasUDFType.SCALAR)\r\ndef fp1(x):\r\n    print(\"run fp1\")\r\n    time.sleep(1)\r\n    return x + 100\r\n\r\n@pandas_udf(\"int\", PandasUDFType.SCALAR)\r\ndef fp2(x, y):\r\n    print(\"run fp2\")\r\n    time.sleep(1)\r\n    return x + y\r\n\r\nbeg_time = time.time()\r\nresult = df.select(sum(fp2(fp1('a'), col('a')))).head()\r\nprint(\"result: \" + str(result[0]))\r\nprint(\"consume time: \" + str(time.time() - beg_time))\r\n\r\n```\r\n#### Test Result:\r\n\r\n**Before**: consume time: 63.57s\r\n**After**: consume time: 32.43s\r\n**So the PR improve performance by make downstream UDF get pipelined early.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease review https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange the Driver resource discovery argument for standalone mode to be a file rather then separate address configs per resource. This makes it consistent with how the Executor is doing it and makes it more flexible in the future, and it makes for less configs if you have multiple resources.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests and basic manually testing to make sure files were parsed properly.\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-28T14:53:12Z","updated_at":"2019-05-30T12:55:15Z","closed_at":"2019-05-30T12:55:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ac558b8dcb60acae55481bfe82e93f30972cd674","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24730/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24730/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24730/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c046f07f2fb4850a75b954ec423e27c231b36aff","head":{"label":"tgravescs:SPARK-27835-driver-resourcesFile","ref":"SPARK-27835-driver-resourcesFile","sha":"c046f07f2fb4850a75b954ec423e27c231b36aff","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17249522,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0OTUyMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"tgravescs/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMany users frequently load structured data from csv datasources. It's is very common with current APIs to load csv as Dataframe where schema needs to be defined as StructType object. Many users then convert Dataframe to Dataset with objects of Product (case classes).\r\nLoading CSV files becomes relatively complex which can be easily simplified. This change would help to work with csv files more user friendly.\r\n\r\n**Input -** \r\n```    \r\ncsv file with five columns - {id: Int,\r\n name: String,\r\n subject: String,\r\n marks: Int,\r\n result: Boolean}\r\n```\r\n**Current approach -**\r\n```\r\nval schema = StructType(StructField(id,IntegerType,false),\r\nStructField(name,StringType,false),\r\nStructField(subject,StringType,false),\r\nStructField(marks,IntegerType,false),\r\nStructField(result,Booleanype,false))\r\n\r\nval df = spark.read.schema(schema).csv(<file_path>)\r\ncase class A(id: Int, name: String, subject: String, marks: Int, result: Boolean) \r\nval ds = df.as[A]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Proposed change -**\r\n```\r\ncase class A (id: Int, name: String, subject: String, marks: Int, result: Boolean) \r\nval df = spark.createDataframe[A](optionsMap, <file_paths>)\r\nval ds = spark.createDataset[A](optionsMap, <file_paths>)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- No explicit schema definition with StructType is needed as it can be resolved by Product classes.\r\n- Redundant codebase in applications to define verbose structType can be avoided with this change.\r\n- Proposed APIs are similar to current APIs so easy to use. All current and future csv options can be used as is with no changes needed. (exception - inferSchema is internally disabled as it's useless/confusing with this api)\r\n- Similar to current createDataset/createDataframe APIs, it would make loading csv files for debug purpose more convenient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThis change is manually tested. I didnt see similar createDataset/createDataframe unit test cases. Please let me know best place to add unit test cases for this and existing similar APIs.\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-28T04:28:33Z","updated_at":"2019-05-30T18:26:57Z","closed_at":"2019-05-28T05:58:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c3cdcc1e42371c82f4acef1ebe0b268971d1ce2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24724/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24724/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24724/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bdb6a1cd5e540a42b150252b0f15af8a6a36453d","head":{"label":"swapnilushinde:csv-pr","ref":"csv-pr","sha":"bdb6a1cd5e540a42b150252b0f15af8a6a36453d","user":{"login":"swapnilushinde","id":1649704,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDk3MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1649704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde","html_url":"https://github.com/swapnilushinde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":137745927,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzc3NDU5Mjc=","name":"spark","full_name":"swapnilushinde/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"swapnilushinde","id":1649704,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDk3MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1649704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde","html_url":"https://github.com/swapnilushinde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swapnilushinde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/swapnilushinde/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis moves parsing logic for `ALTER TABLE` into Catalyst and adds parsed logical plans for alter table changes that use multi-part identifiers. This PR is similar to SPARK-27108, PR #24029, that created parsed logical plans for create and CTAS.\r\n\r\n* Create parsed logical plans\r\n* Move parsing logic into Catalyst's AstBuilder\r\n* Convert to DataSource plans in DataSourceResolution\r\n* Parse `ALTER TABLE ... SET LOCATION ...` separately from the partition variant\r\n* Parse `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... [TYPE dataType] [COMMENT comment]` [as discussed on the dev list](http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/DISCUSS-Syntax-for-table-DDL-td25197.html#a25270)\r\n* Parse `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME COLUMN ... TO ...`\r\n* Parse `ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMNS ...`\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n* Added new tests in Catalyst's `DDLParserSuite`\r\n* Moved converted plan tests from SQL `DDLParserSuite` to `PlanResolutionSuite`\r\n*

The issue was that the `fieldWriter` relied on the index from the avro schema before nulls were filtered out.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA test for the case of multiple non-null

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTo follow https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17397, the output of FileTable and DataSourceV2ScanExecBase can contain sensitive information (like Amazon keys). Such information should not end up in logs, or be exposed to non-privileged users.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to add a redaction facility for these outputs to resolve the issue. A user can enable this by setting a regex in the same spark.redaction.string.regex configuration as V1.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nHadoop `Configuration` has an internal `properties` map which is lazily initialized. Initialization of this field, done in the private `Configuration.getProps()` method, is rather expensive because it ends up parsing XML configuration files. When cloning a `Configuration`, this `properties` field is cloned if it has been initialized.\r\n\r\nIn some cases it's possible that `sc.hadoopConfiguration` never ends up computing this `properties` field, leading to performance problems when this configuration is cloned in `SessionState.newHadoopConf()` because each cloned `Configuration` needs to re-parse configuration XML files from disk.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this problem, we can call `Configuration.size()` to trigger a call to `getProps()`, ensuring that this expensive computation is cached and re-used when cloning configurations.\r\n\r\nI discovered this problem while performance profiling the Spark ThriftServer while running a SQL fuzzing workload.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExamined YourKit profiles before and after my change.","created_at":"2019-05-26T23:47:24Z","updated_at":"2019-12-30T03:20:50Z","closed_at":"2019-06-10T01:02:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb6c60e7e5f29747c6e86271613e8de7612eb85f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24714/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24714/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24714/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/088a6d822d143e9e4f1f60575bd168b98710d321","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:fuzzing-perf-improvements","ref":"fuzzing-perf-improvements","sha":"088a6d822d143e9e4f1f60575bd168b98710d321","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUTF8String's `fromString()`, `toString()`, and `numBytesForFirstByte()` methods are performance hotspots.\r\n\r\nThis patch improves the performance of those methods by implementing special-case optimizations for strings which consist entirely of ASCII characters. Early microbenchmarks show a ~2x speedup for `numChars()` (which uses `numBytesForFirstByte()`), a ~20% speedup of `toString()` for short ASCII strings, and a 1.3x-1.9x speedup of `fromString()` for short ASCII strings (with somewhat negligible impact for non-ASCII strings).\r\n\r\nThis assumes that it's cheap to check whether a string is ASCII: my changes may harm performance in case non-ASCII strings cannot be quickly identified (e.g. the first non-ASCII character in a string appears at the very end of a huge string). To allow this optimization to be disabled, we may be able to add a static system property feature flag (we must use a static property instead of runtime conf. because the overhead of checking the configuration must be minimized: the configuration must be effectively constant for the lifetime of the JVM).\r\n\r\nI'll now describe each optimization in turn:\r\n\r\n### numBytesForFirstByte()\r\n\r\nUTF8 uses between 1 and 4 bytes to encode characters. If we want to quickly determine the character length of a string (numChars()) or iterate character-by-character (e.g. to support substring / slice operations) then we need a fast method for determining how many bytes are used to store a codepoint. Spark's `numBytesForFirstByte()` method takes the first byte of a codepoint and returns the number of bytes in the codepoint (for ASCII characters, this is 1 byte).\r\n\r\nSpark's current implementation converts the codepoint's first (signed) byte into an unsigned integer (e.g. 0 to 255) and uses it to index into a 256-element lookup table where each position records the number of bytes in the codepoint. For ASCII characters, we end up indexing into an essentially random location in one half of this array and this has a performance penalty. \r\n\r\nAs an optimization, we can simply check whether the signed byte is positive (e.g. highest-order bit is 0): if so, we can short-circuit and return `1` because we know that the character is ASCII.\r\n\r\nWith this optimization I saw a ~2x speedup in `numChars()` and I expect it will also benefit other methoids, including substring(), indexOf(), upper(), lower(), and trim().\r\n\r\n### fromString()\r\n\r\nUTF8String.fromString(String) was originally implemented as \r\n\r\n```\r\nstr.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this is inefficient for ASCII characters because it ends up over-allocating a byte array and then needs to copy it to trim it. To see this:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// Helper function for measuring total allocations on current thread:\r\ndef measureAllocations(f: => Unit) {\r\n  import java.lang.management.ManagementFactory\r\n  import com.sun.management.ThreadMXBean\r\n  val threadMxBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean.asInstanceOf[ThreadMXBean]\r\n  def getAlloc() = threadMxBean.getThreadAllocatedBytes(Thread.currentThread.getId)\r\n  System.gc()\r\n  val allocStart = getAlloc()\r\n  f\r\n  System.gc()\r\n  val allocEnd = getAlloc()\r\n  println(s\"${(allocEnd - allocStart) / (1024 * 1024)} MB\")\r\n}\r\n\r\nmeasureAllocations {\r\n  val s = \"12345678\"\r\n  var i = 0\r\n  while (i < 1000 * 1000) {\r\n    // Use string charset name instead of StandardCharsets.UTF_8\r\n    // so we re-use a cached thread local StringEncoder.\r\n    // See https://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.com/2012/12/encode-utf-8-string-to-bytebuffer-faster.html \r\n    s.getBytes(\"UTF-8\")\r\n    i += 1\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis 8-character ASCII string can be stored in only 8 bytes for the array slots (plus 16 bytes of object + array header + alignment overhead), so each array should take 24 bytes of space and we'd expect converting 1 million of them to perform around ~24 MB of allocations.\r\n\r\nHowever, the code above allocates ~3x more memory than expected (~61 MB)! The reason for this is that it allocates an overly-large byte array based on an estimated bytes per character (which is > 1) and then needs to trim it.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we know that a string is ASCII then we can allocate a right-sized byte array ourselves and then can copy each character by casting it to a byte.\r\n\r\n### toString()\r\n\r\nIf we know that our bytes are ASCII then we can call the deprecated `String(bytes[], int)` constructor to invoke a path which simply casts each byte into a char, completely skipping the `StringDecoder` (and any associated allocation / GC (or thread-local lookups if passing a charset name instead of a `StandardCharsets` constant)).\r\n\r\nWe could perform a `byte[]` to `char[]` conversion ourselves but that forces us to pay for an additional defensive copy of the `char[]`, whereas the deprecated constructor lets us skip this. I checked and this deprecated constructor is still present in newer versions of Java (and, in fact, has been optimized to support the JDK9 CompactString features).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCorrectness should be covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\nTo measure performance I added a set of microbenchmarks for `UTF8String`.\r\n\r\n **Benchmarking help, especially on real workloads, would be very appreciated** 😃

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR significantly improves the performance of `UTF8String.replace()` by performing direct replacement over UTF8 bytes instead of decoding those bytes into Java Strings. \r\n\r\nIn cases where the search string is not found (i.e. no replacements are performed, a case which I expect to be common) this new implementation performs no object allocation or memory copying.\r\n\r\nMy implementation is modeled after `commons-lang3`'s `StringUtils.replace()` method. As part of my implementation, I needed a StringBuilder / resizable buffer, so I moved `UTF8StringBuilder` from the `catalyst` package to `unsafe`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCopied tests from `StringExpressionSuite` to `UTF8StringSuite` and added a couple of new cases.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate performance, I did some quick local benchmarking by running the following code in `spark-shell` (with Java 1.8.0_191):\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String\r\n\r\ndef benchmark(text: String, search: String, replace: String) {\r\n  val utf8Text = UTF8String.fromString(text)\r\n  val utf8Search = UTF8String.fromString(search)\r\n  val utf8Replace = UTF8String.fromString(replace)\r\n\r\n  val start = System.currentTimeMillis\r\n  var i = 0\r\n  while (i < 1000 * 1000 * 100) {\r\n    utf8Text.replace(utf8Search, utf8Replace)\r\n    i += 1\r\n  }\r\n  val end = System.currentTimeMillis\r\n\r\n  println(end - start)\r\n}\r\n\r\nbenchmark(\"ABCDEFGH\", \"DEF\", \"ZZZZ\")  // replacement occurs\r\nbenchmark(\"ABCDEFGH\", \"Z\", \"\")  // no replacement occurs\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn my laptop this took ~54 / ~40 seconds seconds before this patch's changes and ~6.5 / ~3.8 seconds afterwards.","created_at":"2019-05-25T07:18:46Z","updated_at":"2019-06-19T22:25:30Z","closed_at":"2019-06-19T22:25:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"10c7d75b77a9e34a802ffa27e896147b412817a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24707/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24707/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24707/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6188dcdd321967eb78535d7cf55b73f20047f449","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:faster-string-replace","ref":"faster-string-replace","sha":"6188dcdd321967eb78535d7cf55b73f20047f449","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImplemented a new SparkPlan that executes the query adaptively. It splits the query plan into independent stages and executes them in order according to their dependencies. The query stage materializes its output at the end. When one stage completes, the data statistics of the materialized output will be used to optimize the remainder of the query.\r\n\r\nThe adaptive mode is off by default, when turned on, user can see \"AdaptiveSparkPlan\" as the top node of a query or sub-query. The inner plan of \"AdaptiveSparkPlan\" is subject to change during query execution but becomes final once the execution is complete. Whether the inner plan is final is included in the EXPLAIN string. Below is an example of the EXPLAIN plan before and after execution:\r\n\r\nQuery:\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM testData JOIN testData2 ON key = a WHERE value = '1'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore

change refactors the portions of the ExecutorAllocationManager class that\r\ntrack executor state into a new class, to achieve a few goals:\r\n\r\n- make the code easier to understand\r\n- better separate concerns (task backlog vs. executor state)\r\n- less synchronization between event and allocation threads\r\n- less coupling between the allocation code and executor state tracking\r\n\r\nThe executor tracking code was moved to a new class (ExecutorMonitor) that\r\nencapsulates all the logic of tracking what happens to executors and when\r\nthey can be timed out. The logic to actually remove the executors remains\r\nin the EAM, since it still requires information that is not tracked by the\r\nnew executor monitor code.\r\n\r\nIn the executor monitor itself, of interest, specifically, is a change in\r\nhow cached blocks are tracked; instead of polling the block manager, the\r\nmonitor now uses events to track which executors have cached blocks, and\r\nis able to detect also unpersist events and adjust the time when the executor\r\nshould be removed accordingly. (That's the bug mentioned in the PR title.)\r\n\r\nBecause of the refactoring, a few tests in the old EAM test suite were removed,\r\nsince they're now covered by the newly added test suite. The EAM suite was\r\nalso changed a little bit to not instantiate a SparkContext every time. This\r\nallowed some cleanup, and the tests also run faster.\r\n\r\nTested with new and updated unit tests, and with multiple TPC-DS workloads\r\nrunning with dynamic allocation on; also some manual tests for the caching\r\nbehavior.\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-24T22:39:07Z","updated_at":"2019-06-05T17:05:32Z","closed_at":"2019-06-05T13:14:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0c156042a79a41445703d5173f181c79bb13a907","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24704/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24704/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24704/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9ae62d930aec531c5c19a718a76ea4ac01c2695d","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-20286","ref":"SPARK-20286","sha":"9ae62d930aec531c5c19a718a76ea4ac01c2695d","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd ability to map the spark resource configs spark.{executor/driver}.resource.{resourceName} to kubernetes Container builder so that we request resources (gpu,s/fpgas/etc) from kubernetes.\r\nNote that the spark configs will overwrite any resource configs users put into a pod template.\r\nI added a generic vendor config which is only used by kubernetes right now.  I intentionally didn't put it into the kubernetes config namespace just to avoid adding more config prefixes. \r\n\r\nI will add more documentation for this under jira SPARK-27492. I think it will be easier to do all at once to get cohesive story.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests and manually testing on k8s cluster.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled` was added when we add PySpark arrow optimization.\r\nLater, in the current master, SparkR arrow optimization was added and it's controlled by the same configuration `spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled`.\r\n\r\nThere look two issues about this:\r\n\r\n1. `spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled` in PySpark was added from 2.3.0 whereas SparkR optimization was added 3.0.0. The stability is different so it's problematic when we change the default value for one of both optimization first.\r\n\r\n2. Suppose users want to share some JVM by PySpark and SparkR. They are currently forced to use the optimization for all or none if the configuration is set globally.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes two separate configuration groups for PySpark and SparkR about Arrow optimization:\r\n\r\n- Deprecate `spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled`\r\n- Add `spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled` (fallback to `spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled`)\r\n- Add `spark.sql.execution.arrow.sparkr.enabled`\r\n- Deprecate `spark.sql.execution.arrow.fallback.enabled`\r\n- Add `spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.fallback.enabled ` (fallback to `spark.sql.execution.arrow.fallback.enabled`)\r\n\r\nNote that `spark.sql.execution.arrow.maxRecordsPerBatch` is used within JVM side for both.\r\nNote that `spark.sql.execution.arrow.fallback.enabled` was added due to behaviour change. We don't need it in SparkR - SparkR side has the automatic fallback.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested and some unittests were added.","created_at":"2019-05-24T14:57:23Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:19:17Z","closed_at":"2019-06-03T01:05:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9f17b90555990a0f5de9d3ecd9a6594103c9b5b1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24700/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24700/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24700/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f6a2d991e1f4a4446dc253111a7095b8f70aeb27","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:separate-sparkr-arrow","ref":"separate-sparkr-arrow","sha":"f6a2d991e1f4a4446dc253111a7095b8f70aeb27","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

And at the time WriteThread exhausts all elements, it will try to release the corresponding block but hit a AssertionError since task has already released that lock previously. \r\n\r\n#24542 previously fix this by catching AssertionError, so that we won't fail our executor.\r\n\r\nHowever, when not using PySpark, issue still exists when user implements a custom RDD or task, which spawn a separate child thread to consume iterator from a cached parent RDD. Below is a demo which could easily reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    val rdd0 = sc.parallelize(Range(0, 10), 1).cache()\r\n    rdd0.collect()\r\n    rdd0.mapPartitions { iter =>\r\n      val t = new Thread(new Runnable {\r\n        override def run(): Unit = {\r\n          while(iter.hasNext) {\r\n            println(iter.next())\r\n            Thread.sleep(1000)\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      })\r\n      t.setDaemon(false)\r\n      t.start()\r\n      Iterator(0)\r\n    }.collect()\r\n    Thread.sleep(100000)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, if we could prevent the separate thread from releasing lock on block when TaskContext has already completed, we won't hit this issue again.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded in new unit test in RDDSuite.\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-24T14:44:28Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T06:03:28Z","closed_at":"2019-06-18T02:20:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"de42b13208bc7fe07efc407a56eb030cea6cf4c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24699/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24699/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24699/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7f0f360dfb734c44ed2773c60d340d47b17f33fb","head":{"label":"Ngone51:SPARK-27666","ref":"SPARK-27666","sha":"7f0f360dfb734c44ed2773c60d340d47b17f33fb","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR the config `spark.shuffle.service.fetch.rdd.enabled` default is changed to **false** to avoid breaking any compatibility with older external shuffle service installations. As external shuffle service is deployed separately and disk persisted RDD block fetching had even introduced new network messages (`RemoveBlocks` and `BlocksRemoved`) and changed the behaviour of the already existing fetching: extended it for RDD blocks.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWith existing unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCached relation decompresses and creates column batch when accessing cache. It's possible that a thread, for example the threads spawned by the Python runner, doesn't stop immediately reading cached relation after the task is completed. Due to race condition, cached relation might still decompresses and creates new and unnecessary batch. At the moment, the returned batch is also immediately closed. At the reader side, it can cause null exception when reading a closed batch, and we probably need to hide such exception.\r\n\r\nWe don't need to create the batch if the task is completed. It saves the effort to decompress the cached batch and also prevents such exception.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nN/A (Hard to write a unit test case for this case, just manually hacked to check the exception).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-24T10:28:09Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:36:22Z","closed_at":"2019-05-29T11:21:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e4fa4a9a7faf111d04037d96c1e2c45c1f857a75","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24696/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24696/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24696/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/676ee35920cc194e3b96b5671a67370d394f380e","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-27832","ref":"SPARK-27832","sha":"676ee35920cc194e3b96b5671a67370d394f380e","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn order to support outer joins with null top-level objects, SPARK-15441 modified Dataset.joinWith to project both inputs into single-column structs prior to the join.\r\n\r\nFor inner joins, however, this step is unnecessary and actually harms performance: performing the nesting before the join increases the shuffled data size. As an optimization for inner joins only, we can move this nesting to occur after the join (effectively switching back to the pre-SPARK-15441 behavior; see #13425).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests, which I strengthened to also make assertions about the join result's nullability (since this guards against a bug I almost introduced during prototyping).\r\n\r\nHere's a quick `spark-shell` experiment demonstrating the reduction in shuffle size:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// With --conf spark.shuffle.compress=false\r\nsql(\"set spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold=-1\") // for easier shuffle measurements\r\ncase class Foo(a: Long, b: Long)\r\nval left = spark.range(10000).map(x => Foo(x, x))\r\nval right = spark.range(10000).map(x => Foo(x, x))\r\nleft.joinWith(right, left(\"a\") === right(\"a\"), \"inner\").rdd.count()\r\nleft.joinWith(right, left(\"a\") === right(\"a\"), \"left\").rdd.count()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith inner join (which benefits from this PR's optimization) we shuffle 546.9 KiB. With left outer join (whose plan hasn't changed, therefore being a representation of the state before this PR) we shuffle 859.4 KiB. Shuffle compression (which is enabled by default) narrows this gap a bit: with compression, outer joins shuffle about 12% more than inner joins.","created_at":"2019-05-24T03:48:41Z","updated_at":"2019-05-29T14:43:03Z","closed_at":"2019-05-29T08:15:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e466ad9144f7b9b48dd10e0ab08c2eabc51bd82c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24693/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24693/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24693/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ec4d7856e1077247d4dc6c3311acf77c160c4eec","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:fast-join-with-for-inner-joins","ref":"fast-join-with-for-inner-joins","sha":"ec4d7856e1077247d4dc6c3311acf77c160c4eec","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRequire the lookup function with interface LookupCatalog. Rationale is in the review comments below.\r\n\r\nMake `Analyzer` abstract. BaseSessionStateBuilder and HiveSessionStateBuilder implements lookupCatalog with a call to SparkSession.catalog().\r\n\r\nExisting test cases and those that don't need catalog lookup will use a newly added `TestAnalyzer` with a default lookup function that throws` CatalogNotFoundException(\"No catalog lookup function\")`.\r\n\r\nRewrote the unit test for LookupCatalog to demonstrate the interface can be used anywhere, not just Analyzer.\r\n\r\nRemoved Analyzer parameter `lookupCatalog` because we can override in the following manner:\r\n```\r\nnew Analyzer() {\r\n  override def lookupCatalog(name: String): CatalogPlugin = ???\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests.","created_at":"2019-05-23T16:59:36Z","updated_at":"2019-05-30T01:40:07Z","closed_at":"2019-05-30T01:25:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d7a495b01a0c26adf88dfe7b3f83bb03adeafd53","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24689/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24689/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24689/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cecbea0c83931779572058a07c203697a0e74ceb","head":{"label":"jzhuge:SPARK-26946-follow","ref":"SPARK-26946-follow","sha":"cecbea0c83931779572058a07c203697a0e74ceb","user":{"login":"jzhuge","id":1883812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODM4MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1883812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge","html_url":"https://github.com/jzhuge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":102246817,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDIyNDY4MTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"jzhuge/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jzhuge","id":1883812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODM4MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1883812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge","html_url":"https://github.com/jzhuge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzhuge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jzhuge/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor a partitioned table, such as:\r\n```\r\ntable test (c1 int, c2 string) partitioned by (c3 Int)\r\n```\r\nIf we use a cast operation in query, which casts the partition key, such as :\r\n```\r\nselect * from test where (cast c3 as string)  = '0'\r\n``` \r\nOne predication of this query is ` cast(c3 as string) = ’0‘`.\r\nIt would invoke  this method to convert to a filter.\r\n```\r\n     case op @ SpecialBinaryComparison(\r\n          ExtractAttribute(NonVarcharAttribute(name)), ExtractableLiteral(value)) =>\r\n        Some(s\"$name ${op.symbol} $value\")\r\n```\r\nFirst, it invokes the ExtractAttribute.unapply to judge whether c3 can be casted to string, the result is yes.\r\nThen it would invoke the origin NonVarcharAttribute, because the hivevar type of c3 is not  varchar,\r\n this prediction will be converted to  filter `c3 = \"0\"`, and pushed down.\r\n\r\nBut, Filtering is supported only on partition keys of type

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`ExecutorClassLoader`'s `findClass` may fail to fetch a class due to transient exceptions. For example, when a task is interrupted, if `ExecutorClassLoader` is fetching a class, you may see `InterruptedException` or `IOException` wrapped by `ClassNotFoundException`, even if this class can be loaded. Then the result of `findClass` will be cached by JVM, and later when the same class is being loaded in the same executor, it will just throw NoClassDefFoundError even if the class can be loaded.\r\n\r\nI found JVM only caches `LinkageError` and `ClassNotFoundException`. Hence in this PR, I changed ExecutorClassLoader to throw `RemoteClassLoadedError` if we cannot get a response from driver.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests.","created_at":"2019-05-22T21:53:50Z","updated_at":"2019-08-04T13:42:02Z","closed_at":"2019-05-28T19:59:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f691572b49cfd88adf024a506f9f95af030ca813","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24683/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24683/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24683/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0b5cb4880b1793152f0ef2e4e664e6ebe7a82d4d","head":{"label":"zsxwing:SPARK-20547-fix","ref":"SPARK-20547-fix","sha":"0b5cb4880b1793152f0ef2e4e664e6ebe7a82d4d","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":88661206,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4ODY2MTIwNg==","name":"spark","full_name":"zsxwing/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen the data is read from the sources, the catalyst schema is always nullable. Since Avro uses Union type to represent nullable, when any non-nullable avro file is read and then written out, the schema will always be changed. \r\n\r\nThis PR provides a solution for users to keep the Avro schema without being forced to use Union type.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nOne test is added.","created_at":"2019-05-22T21:50:36Z","updated_at":"2020-02-10T10:12:20Z","closed_at":"2019-05-24T21:50:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"35b5cdab773a8fc66217c9af9e8566062b9ab8f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24682/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24682/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24682/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/09197e66a53df33c5cc135012658f3f8ddaac4a2","head":{"label":"dbtsai:avroNull","ref":"avroNull","sha":"09197e66a53df33c5cc135012658f3f8ddaac4a2","user":{"login":"dbtsai","id":1134574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai","html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34716514,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDcxNjUxNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"dbtsai/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dbtsai","id":1134574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai","html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nEach time, when I write a complex CREATE DATABASE/VIEW statements, I have to open the .g4 file to find the EXACT order of clauses in CREATE TABLE statement. When the order is not right, I will get A strange confusing error message generated from ANTLR4.\r\n\r\nThe original g4 grammar for CREATE VIEW is\r\n```\r\nCREATE [OR REPLACE] [[GLOBAL] TEMPORARY] VIEW [db_name.]view_name\r\n  [(col_name1 [COMMENT col_comment1], ...)]\r\n  [COMMENT table_comment]\r\n  [TBLPROPERTIES (key1=val1, key2=val2, ...)]\r\nAS select_statement\r\n```\r\nThe proposal is to make the following clauses order insensitive.\r\n```\r\n  [COMMENT table_comment]\r\n  [TBLPROPERTIES (key1=val1, key2=val2, ...)]\r\n```\r\n–\r\nThe original g4 grammar for CREATE DATABASE is\r\n```\r\nCREATE (DATABASE|SCHEMA) [IF NOT EXISTS] db_name\r\n  [COMMENT comment_text]\r\n  [LOCATION path]\r\n  [WITH DBPROPERTIES (key1=val1, key2=val2, ...)]\r\n```\r\nThe proposal is to make the following clauses order insensitive.\r\n```\r\n  [COMMENT comment_text]\r\n  [LOCATION path]\r\n  [WITH DBPROPERTIES (key1=val1, key2=val2, ...)]\r\n```\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy adding new unit tests to test duplicate clauses and modifying some existing unit tests to test whether those clauses are actually order insensitive","created_at":"2019-05-22T21:48:11Z","updated_at":"2019-05-25T02:45:33Z","closed_at":"2019-05-24T22:22:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6734167ae70f7152268ede169c4bbd1ec5a34372","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24681/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24681/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24681/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f3a9d5cdd070433c90166bfe4405648f6ccebad2","head":{"label":"yeshengm:create-view-parser","ref":"create-view-parser","sha":"f3a9d5cdd070433c90166bfe4405648f6ccebad2","user":{"login":"yeshengm","id":12269969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY5OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12269969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm","html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187889692,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc4ODk2OTI=","name":"spark","full_name":"yeshengm/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yeshengm","id":12269969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY5OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12269969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm","html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22104 , we create the python-eval nodes at the end of the optimization phase, which causes a problem.\r\n\r\nAfter the main optimization batch, Filter and Project nodes are usually pushed to the bottom, near the scan node. However, if we extract Python UDFs from Filter/Project, and create a python-eval node under Filter/Project, it will break column pruning/filter pushdown of the scan node.\r\n\r\nThere are some hacks in the `ExtractPythonUDFs` rule, to duplicate the column pruning and filter pushdown logic. However, it has some bugs as demonstrated in the new test case(only column pruning is broken). This PR removes the hacks and re-apply the column pruning and filter pushdown rules explicitly.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\na: bigint\r\nProject

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nInMemoryFileIndex.listLeafFiles should use listLocatedStatus for DistributedFileSystem. DistributedFileSystem overrides the listLocatedStatus method in order to do it with 1 single namenode call thus saving thousands of calls to getBlockLocations.\r\n\r\nCurrently in InMemoryFileIndex, all directory listings are done using FileSystem.listStatus following by individual calls to FileSystem.getFileBlockLocations. This is painstakingly slow for folders that have large numbers of files because this process happens serially and parallelism is only applied at the folder level, not the file level.\r\n\r\nFileSystem also provides another API listLocatedStatus which returns the LocatedFileStatus objects that already have the block locations. In FileSystem main class this just delegates to listStatus and getFileBlockLocations similarly to the way Spark does it. However when HDFS specifically is the backing file system, DistributedFileSystem overrides this method and simply makes one single call to the namenode to retrieve the directory listing with the block locations. This avoids potentially thousands or more calls to namenode and also is more consistent because files will either exist with locations or not exist instead of having the FileNotFoundException exception case. \r\n\r\nFor our example directory with 6500 files, the load time of spark.read.parquet was reduced 96x from 76 seconds to .8 seconds. This savings only goes up with the number of files in the directory.\r\n\r\nIn the pull request instead of using this method always which could lead to a FileNotFoundException that could be tough to

of `spark.driver.memoryOverhead` start with `The amount of off-heap memory to be allocated per driver in cluster mode`.\r\nBut `MemoryManager` also managed a memory area named off-heap used to allocate memory in tungsten mode.\r\nSo I think the description of `spark.driver.memoryOverhead` always make confused.\r\n\r\n`spark.executor.memoryOverhead` has the same confused with

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPython uses a prefetch approach to read the result from upstream and serve them in another thread, thus it's possible that if the children operator doesn't consume all the data then the Task cleanup may happen before Python side read process finishes, this in turn create a race condition that the block read locks are freed during Task cleanup and then the reader try to release the read lock it holds and find it has been released, in this case we shall hit a AssertionError.\r\n\r\nWe shall catch the AssertionError in PythonRunner and prevent this kill the Executor.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nHard to write a unit test case for this case, manually verified with failed job.","created_at":"2019-05-22T02:24:05Z","updated_at":"2019-05-22T15:38:36Z","closed_at":"2019-05-22T15:38:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"937bff09afebd0c8d929d0359185b7e6450a004f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24670/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24670/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24670/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cb4dfa379c519174ac3064b4f8aba3986089659e","head":{"label":"rezasafi:branch-2.3","ref":"branch-2.3","sha":"cb4dfa379c519174ac3064b4f8aba3986089659e","user":{"login":"rezasafi","id":20547172,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTQ3MTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20547172?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi","html_url":"https://github.com/rezasafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":64172231,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NDE3MjIzMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rezasafi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rezasafi","id":20547172,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTQ3MTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20547172?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi","html_url":"https://github.com/rezasafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rezasafi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark's `InMemoryFileIndex` contains two places where `FileNotFound` exceptions are caught and logged as warnings (during [directory listing](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/bcd3b61c4be98565352491a108e6394670a0f413/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/InMemoryFileIndex.scala#L274) and [block location lookup](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/bcd3b61c4be98565352491a108e6394670a0f413/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/InMemoryFileIndex.scala#L333)). This logic was added in #15153 and #21408.\r\n\r\nI think that this is a dangerous default behavior because it can mask bugs caused by race conditions (e.g. overwriting a table while it's being read) or S3 consistency issues (there's more discussion on this in the [JIRA ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27676)). Failing fast when we detect missing files is not sufficient to make concurrent table reads/writes or S3 listing safe (there are other classes of eventual consistency issues to worry about), but I think it's still beneficial to throw exceptions and fail-fast on the subset of inconsistencies / races that we _can_ detect because that increases the likelihood that an end user will notice the problem and investigate further.\r\n\r\nThere may be some cases where users _do_ want to ignore missing files, but I think that should be an opt-in behavior via the existing `spark.sql.files.ignoreMissingFiles` flag (the current behavior is itself race-prone because a file might be be deleted between catalog listing and query execution time, triggering FileNotFoundExceptions on executors (which are handled in a way that _does_ respect `ignoreMissingFIles`)).\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `InMemoryFileIndex` to guard the log-and-ignore-FileNotFoundException behind the existing `spark.sql.files.ignoreMissingFiles` flag.\r\n\r\n**Note**: this is a change of default behavior, so I think it needs to be mentioned in release notes.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests to simulate file-deletion race conditions, tested with both values of the `ignoreMissingFIles`

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, the SparkSQL UI page shows only actual metric info in each SparkPlan node. However with `statistics` info may help us understand how the plan is designed and the reason why it runs slowly. This PR is to show `numOutputRows` metric's `statistic` info of `BroadcastHashJoinExec` node on SparkSQL UI page when it's available.\r\n\r\nThe main changes:\r\n1.  Add `stats` field in `SQLMetric` and passing it to `SQLPlanMetric` to show on UI page when it's available\r\n2. Initialize `numOutputRows` with rowCount `stats` in `logicalPlan` of `BroadcastHashJoinExec`, thanks to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24626\r\n\r\n<img width=\"311\" alt=\"SPARK-27482-1\"

feature is designed to handle data skew in Join\r\n\r\n**Senario**\r\n- A big table (big_skewed) which contains a a few skewed key\r\n- A small table (small_even) which has no skewed key and is **larger than the broadcast threshold** \r\n- When big_skewed.join(small_even), a few tasks will be much slower than other tasks because they need to handle the skewed key\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n- Provide a hint to indicate which keys are skewed keys\r\n- Handle the skewed keys with broadcastjoin and join the non-skewed keys with normal joint method\r\n- For the small table, the whole table is larger than the broadcast threshold. But total size of the records with the same keys which is skewed keys in the big table is smaller than the broadcast threshold, so these records can be joint with the big table with broadcast join\r\n- For other records with non-skewed keys, they can be joint with normal join method\r\n- We can get the final result with union the above two parts\r\n\r\n**Effect**\r\nThis feature reduce the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSuppose that we have a hive table created like this ```create table parquet_test (id int) using parquet```,  and our query sql is `select id from parquet_test limit 10`.\r\n\r\nWith `spark.sql.hive.convertMetastoreParquet`  set to false, the sql execution will go into `InputAdapter`, in its codegen, it can use `stopEarly` to accelerate local limit.\r\n\r\nBut if we set  `spark.sql.hive.convertMetastoreParquet`  to true, the sql exectuion will go into `ColumnarBatchScan`, which didn't optimize local limit.\r\n\r\nIn this patch, We use `stopEarly` in `ColumnarBatchScan` as well to accelerate local limit.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTest manually by codegen.\r\n\r\nFor sql `select id from parquet_test limit 10`,\r\n\r\nthe code generated before patch\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1312321/58088452-4a951900-7bf5-11e9-945d-2071489583f6.png)\r\n\r\nthe code generated after

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark Thrift server is a long running service. If we enabled Spark event log, the log won't close util Spark Thrift server exits. This event log is always too big to be replayed by history server. So this feature of session aware event log writes a standalone event log for each session.\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't change the original Spark Event log at all. It imports a new one.\r\nTo enable it, set `spark.sql.hive.thriftServer.eventLog.enabled` to `true`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually test.\r\n\r\nTwo connections from beeline will generate two event logs like below:\r\n\r\n> $ ls -l\r\ntotal 528\r\n-rwxrwx---  1 lajin  wheel  78499 May 21 16:13 local-1558423605808_4e223a3d-0c3a-48ab-a210-3a928e29712d\r\n-rwxrwx---  1 lajin

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen running a custom build of Spark which shades `commons-codec`, the `Sha1` expression generates code which fails to compile:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.CodeGenerator: failed to compile: org.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompileException: File 'generated.java', Line 47, Column 93: A method named \"sha1Hex\" is not declared in any enclosing class nor any supertype, nor through a static import\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is caused by an interaction between Spark's code generator and the shading: the current codegen template includes the string `org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils.sha1Hex` as part of a larger string literal, preventing JarJarLinks from being able to replace the class name with the shaded class's name. As a result, the generated code still references the original unshaded class name name, triggering an error in case the original unshaded dependency isn't on the path.\r\n\r\nThis problem impacts the `Sha1`, `Md5`, and `Base64` expressions.\r\n\r\nTo fix this problem and allow for proper shading, this PR updates the codegen templates to replace the hardcoded class names with `${classof[<name>].getName}` calls.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that I found all occurrences of this problem, I used IntelliJ's \"Find in Path\" to search for lines matching the regex `^(?!import|package).*(org|com|net|io)\\.(?!apache\\.spark)` and then filtered matches to inspect only non-test \"Usage in string constants\" cases. This isn't _perfect_ but I think it'll catch most cases.","created_at":"2019-05-21T05:43:08Z","updated_at":"2019-05-21T16:58:23Z","closed_at":"2019-05-21T13:21:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"59dc0bfe1c68bc759afe3cea5326b812b645bb70","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24655/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24655/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24655/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6f01cee3855968f1185bd3d78104ca59ef044a21","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:fix-shaded-apache-commons","ref":"fix-shaded-apache-commons","sha":"6f01cee3855968f1185bd3d78104ca59ef044a21","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBecause a temporary view is resolved during analysis when we create a dataset, the content of the view is determined when the dataset is created, not when it is evaluated. Now the explain result of a dataset is not correctly consistent with the collected result of it, because we use pre-analyzed logical plan of the dataset in explain command. The explain command will analyzed the logical plan passed in. So if a view is changed after the dataset was created, the plans shown by explain command aren't the same with the plan of the dataset.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.range(10).createOrReplaceTempView(\"test\")\r\nscala> spark.range(5).createOrReplaceTempView(\"test2\")\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select * from test\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"tmp001\")\r\nscala> val df = spark.sql(\"select * from tmp001\")\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select * from test2\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"tmp001\")\r\nscala> df.show\r\n+---+\r\n| id|\r\n+---+\r\n|  0|\r\n|  1|\r\n|  2|\r\n|  3|\r\n|  4|\r\n|  5|\r\n|  6|\r\n|  7|\r\n|  8|\r\n|  9|\r\n+---+\r\nscala> df.explain(true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```scala\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\n'Project [*]\r\n+- 'UnresolvedRelation `tmp001`\r\n\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\nid: bigint\r\nProject [id#2L]\r\n+- SubqueryAlias `tmp001`\r\n   +- Project [id#2L]\r\n      +- SubqueryAlias `test2`\r\n         +- Range (0, 5, step=1, splits=Some(12))\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nRange (0, 5, step=1, splits=Some(12))\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Range (0, 5, step=1, splits=12)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```scala\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\n'Project [*]\r\n+- 'UnresolvedRelation `tmp001`\r\n\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\nid: bigint\r\nProject [id#0L]\r\n+- SubqueryAlias `tmp001`\r\n   +- Project [id#0L]\r\n      +- SubqueryAlias `test`\r\n         +- Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=Some(12))\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nRange (0, 10, step=1, splits=Some(12))\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=12)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrevious PR to this issue has a regression when to explain an explain statement, like `sql(\"explain select 1\").explain(true)`. This new fix is following up with @hvanhovell's advice at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24464#issuecomment-494165538.\r\n\r\nExplain an explain:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"explain select

regression after applying @hvanhovell's advice:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.readStream\r\n      .format(\"org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.test\")\r\n      .load()\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nKinesisInputDStream currently does not provide a way to disable\r\nCloudWatch metrics push. Its default level is \"DETAILED\" which pushes\r\n10s of metrics every 10 seconds. When dealing with multiple streaming\r\njobs this add up pretty quickly, leading to thousands of dollars in cost.\r\nTo address this problem, this PR adds interfaces for accessing\r\nKinesisClientLibConfiguration's `withMetrics` and\r\n`withMetricsEnabledDimensions` methods to KinesisInputDStream\r\nso that users can configure KCL's metrics levels and dimensions.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy running updated unit tests in KinesisInputDStreamBuilderSuite.\r\nIn addition, I ran a Streaming job with MetricsLevel.NONE and confirmed:\r\n\r\n* there's no data point for the \"Operation\", \"Operation, ShardId\" and \"WorkerIdentifier\" dimensions on the AWS management console\r\n* there's no DEBUG level message from Amazon KCL, such as \"Successfully published xx datums.\"\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-20T15:04:30Z","updated_at":"2019-09-09T10:11:46Z","closed_at":"2019-09-09T00:49:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9ef4071ef8a1d2c7182a1cf16ea480eb97d294ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587334,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzM0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DSTREAMS","name":"DSTREAMS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406605415,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1NDE1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INPUT/OUTPUT","name":"INPUT/OUTPUT","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24651/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24651/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24651/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c9341a0b2e92a658593e47d39b02eb1026d87235","head":{"label":"sekikn:SPARK-27420","ref":"SPARK-27420","sha":"c9341a0b2e92a658593e47d39b02eb1026d87235","user":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":92109874,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MjEwOTg3NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"sekikn/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI checked the code of \r\n`org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.DataSource`\r\n, there exists duplicate Java reflection.\r\n`sourceSchema`,`createSource`,`createSink`,`resolveRelation`,`writeAndRead`, all the methods call the `providingClass.getConstructor().newInstance()`.\r\nThe instance of `providingClass` is stateless, such as:\r\n`KafkaSourceProvider`\r\n`RateSourceProvider`\r\n`TextSocketSourceProvider`\r\n`JdbcRelationProvider`\r\n`ConsoleSinkProvider`\r\n\r\nAFAIK, Java reflection will result in significant performance issue.\r\nThe oracle website [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/index.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/index.html) contains some performance description about Java reflection:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPerformance Overhead\r\nBecause reflection involves types that are dynamically resolved, certain Java virtual machine optimizations can not be performed. Consequently, reflective operations have slower performance than their non-reflective counterparts, and should be avoided in sections of code which are called frequently in performance-sensitive applications.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have found some performance cost test of Java reflection as follows:\r\n[https://blog.frankel.ch/performance-cost-of-reflection/](https://blog.frankel.ch/performance-cost-of-reflection/) contains performance cost test.\r\n[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/435553/java-reflection-performance](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/435553/java-reflection-performance) has a discussion of java reflection.\r\n\r\nSo I think should avoid duplicate Java reflection and reuse the instance of `providingClass`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExists UT.\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-20T09:23:43Z","updated_at":"2019-05-29T02:36:40Z","closed_at":"2019-05-28T14:29:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7547344f8d7c071f906e40ac9ed8a43fd4c923d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24647/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24647/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24647/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b3c0f3477627e5dd1f75300fbbebc195f689f402","head":{"label":"beliefer:optimize-DataSource","ref":"optimize-DataSource","sha":"b3c0f3477627e5dd1f75300fbbebc195f689f402","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"974b8792205b2882f1b6c6f429c889dbf33434e6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a metric for number of exceptions caught in the `ExternalShuffleBlockHandler`, the idea being that spikes in this metric over some time window (or more desirably, the lack thereof) can be used as an indicator of the health of an external shuffle service. (Where \"health\" refers to its ability to successfully respond to client requests.)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nDeployed a build of this PR to a YARN cluster, and confirmed that the NodeManagers' JMX metrics include `numCaughtExceptions`.\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-20T06:15:28Z","updated_at":"2021-04-06T17:31:20Z","closed_at":"2019-05-30T21:00:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"59d313eeaacc1d57a656a08fd6269951ddc03b27","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24645/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24645/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24645/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6d733aa1a84dcb15b96fd004de44d12fbcbe4891","head":{"label":"sjrand:SPARK-27773","ref":"SPARK-27773","sha":"6d733aa1a84dcb15b96fd004de44d12fbcbe4891","user":{"login":"sjrand","id":1912073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTIwNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1912073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjrand","html_url":"https://github.com/sjrand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjrand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjrand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjrand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjrand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjrand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjrand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjrand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjrand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjrand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":73227084,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MzIyNzA4NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"sjrand/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sjrand","id":1912073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTIwNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1912073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjrand","html_url":"https://github.com/sjrand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjrand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjrand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjrand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjrand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjrand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjrand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjrand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjrand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjrand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sjrand/spark","description":"Mirror
