a Kafka consumer to be used for bundled assignments. By decoupling consumers from splits and running them in separate threads the harness thread should be blocked less by the creation of network connections or outstanding polls. The consumer thread may prefetch a batch of records while the harness thread is processing the current record batch. Multiplexing assigned `TopicPartition`s onto a single consumer may improve utilization of the network connection. A follow up PR may introduce consumer pools for cases where a single consumer would become a bottleneck.\r\n\r\nThese changes to KafkaIO's SDF should meet or exceed the throughput performance of the unbounded source implementation. Attached are the throughput and backlog bytes graphs, shown on the left is KafkaIO's unbounded source on Dataflow (legacy) and shown on the right is KafkaIO's SDF with these changes on Dataflow (portability). The input is produced in GCP by a n2d-standard-16 machine at a rate of ~110 MiB/s to a topic with 500 partitions in a cluster hosted on Google Cloud Managed Service for Apache Kafka. The pipelines use a pool of up to 8 n2d-standard-2 machines each and the pipeline on the left was intentionally configured to not quite catch up with its backlog. It's possible that applying these changes to the unbounded source implementation may result in a slight uplift to throughput performance there as well.\r\n\r\n![results](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2f1d42d-a24c-4fbd-a34a-c1156e1f65b2)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

standard_io.yaml to use snake_case for JDBC providers.\r\n\r\nThere was a change to the naming convention used by the cross-language service here: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/31374/\r\nwhich also migrated most of the YAML provider definitions to use the new format. Unfortunately, JDBC providers that inherit the top-level JDBC Provider (MySQL, Postgres, Oracle and Sql Server) were missed. This causes YAML pipelines who use these transforms to fail when the `jdbc_type` (formerly `jdbcType`) config parameter is parsed during expansion.\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors these transform config parameters to use the new snake_case naming convention.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Beam does the following:\r\n- Pickle Python code\r\n- Send the pickled source code to \"worker\" VMs\r\n- The workers unpickle and execute the code\r\n\r\nIn the environment that these Beam pipelines execute, the source code is in a temporary directory whose name is random and changes. The source code paths relative to the temporary directory are constant. Using absolute paths prevents pickled code from being cached because the absolute path keeps changing. Using relative paths enables this caching and promises significant resource savings and speed-ups.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the absolute paths leak information about the directory structure of the machine pickling the source code. When the pickled code is passed across the network to another machine, the absolute paths may no longer be valid when the other machine has a different directory structure.\r\n\r\nThe reason for using relative paths rather than omitting the path entirely is because Python uses the co_filename attribute to create stack traces.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

updates the AutoValueUtils class which contains helpers that aid in manipulating the AutoValue internal generated classes - builders and concrete implementation of the abstract \"spec\" classes. The helpers will now be able to correctly find builders and generated implementations for generic AutoValue classes, see the newly added tests to see them in action.

Beam does the following:\r\n- Pickle Python code\r\n- Send the pickled source code to \"worker\" VMs\r\n- The workers unpickle and execute the code\r\n\r\nIn the environment that these Beam pipelines execute, the source code is in a temporary directory whose name is random and changes. The source code paths relative to the temporary directory are constant. Using absolute paths prevents pickled code from being cached because the absolute path keeps changing. Using relative paths enables this caching and promises significant resource savings and speed-ups.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the absolute paths leak information about the directory structure of the machine pickling the source code. When the pickled code is passed across the network to another machine, the absolute paths may no longer be valid when the other machine has a different directory structure.\r\n\r\nThe reason for using relative paths rather than omitting the path entirely is because Python uses the co_filename attribute to create stack traces.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

to get the Python Dependency workflow green again by disabling the Py39embeddingsMLTransform suite. The huggingface tests that were failing are red because of an import error, failing to import classes from `sentence-transformers` version 2.2.2 despite pip showing that the package was installed into the test environment successfully. These tests are exercised in other ML test suites and pass, so disabling the run here is not reducing our test coverage overall.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/32596\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug where messages get stuck on the Solace queue because the checkpoint's finalize method, responsible for acknowledging message processing, isn't always called. \r\n\r\nRevisited approach (deprecated approach below):\r\n\r\n1. In advance(), add received messages to `receivedMessages` list. \r\n2. in the `getCheckpointMark()` method, all the `receivedMessages` are moved to the `safeToAckMessages` list. The `safeToAckList` is passed as a reference to the CheckpointMark object.\r\n3. Each `CheckpointMark` object created from a  given Reader has a reference to the same `safeToAckMessages` list. On the `finalizeCheckpoint()` method call, it will acknowledge all messages available for acknowledgement.\r\n4. The practive acknowledgemnt of `safeToAckMessages` happens also in the `advance()` method and the `close()`. This means that whenever the `getCheckpointMark()` method marks messages as ready for checkpoint, they can be acknowledged in either of 3 places:  `finalizeCheckpoint()`, `advance()` and `close()`.\r\n\r\nDeprecated approach:\r\nThe approach is similar to the one in PubSubIO. The flow there is the following:\r\n\r\n1. in the advance(), we copy message to safeToAckIds list ([source](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/07322cc86d35fd2af5c32228796e7936f58416d6/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/pubsub/PubsubUnboundedSource.java#L885))\r\n5. when the runner request a checkpoint, we create it with a copy of safeToAck list ([source](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/07322cc86d35fd2af5c32228796e7936f58416d6/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/pubsub/PubsubUnboundedSource.java#L996))\r\n6. when the checkpoint is finalized, we add the messages to a queue of finalized messages ([source](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/07322cc86d35fd2af5c32228796e7936f58416d6/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/pubsub/PubsubUnboundedSource.java#L579))\r\n7. in the advance() method, remove whatever is in the queue of finalized messages from the safeToAckIds ([source](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/07322cc86d35fd2af5c32228796e7936f58416d6/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/pubsub/PubsubUnboundedSource.java#L617)).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

DO NOT SUBMIT\r\n\r\nOnWindowExpiry:\r\n* largely works, some tests are having hangs that aren't getting caught. Can't submit that yet. Likely related the other timer related hang test, or SDK side crashes.\r\n* Otherwise seems feature complete. Better to implement other features blocking tests from executing to adding instability.\r\n\r\nOrderedListState:\r\n* the encoding wasn't clear until we saw that we certainly not getting the standard TimestampedValueCoder: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/values/TimestampedValue.java#L108\r\n* OrderedListState defines it's own. More compact, but was difficult to find. https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/harness/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/fn/harness/state/OrderedListUserState.java#L121\r\n* Still TODO: Parsing out the individual values and sorting them correctly. TBD  if we can cheekily re-use the bags instead of the VarInts, which would be nice.\r\n\r\nWIP: DO NOT SUBMIT\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

This means that any uncaught exception will terminate the JVM.

reverts #31137 and #31281. The changes in the former PR overwrite the per-split metric `backlog_bytes.${SPLIT}` with the per-partition metric rather than the accumulated value for the split. The latter PR introduced a map to store metrics for all past and current splits (1 partition) of the `ReadFromKafkaDoFn` instance and may repeatedly overwrite non-current splits with stale values. The map used to store these values is not thread-safe and may trigger a `ConcurrentModificationException` since `GetSize` and other SDF methods may concurrently attempt to read and write the map.\n\nFinally, the per-split caches kept by the instance are keyed on `TopicPartition`, which is not unique among all splits since the split may override the bootstrap server. This has been fixed for this cache, all other caches will be patched in a separate PR.\n\n------------------------\n\nThank you for your contribution!

Add a Java gradle task to run validates runner tests on Prism.\r\n* Filtered to green tests. Added notes about what's broken with them, along with links to pertinent issues.\r\n* Broken tests that will terminate are in the sickbay list, to separate data, from configuration.\r\n* Add log_level filtering to prism. It was easier to have the Java PrismRunner wrapper re-launch the binary all the time. Set Java default to warning log. Can be overridden by a `--prismLogLevel` flag. Replaces the recently added `--debug` flag. \r\n* Add a Gradle Action to run as Precommit.\r\n\r\nPart of #28187\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

`endOffsets` instead of `seekToEnd` and `position` to determine the backlog element size in `KafkaUnboundedReader` and `ReadFromKafkaDoFn`. Determining the end offsets by seeking and retrieving the position may trigger `poll` and prefetch records which will never be consumed by the offset consumer.\n\nForcibly retrieving the partition's high watermark in offset consumers might not be necessary, but this will be addressed separately.\n\n------------------------\n\nThank you for your contribution!

helpful in figuring out the issue.\r\n\r\nWhen there's a type hint issue, I want to know:\r\n  - Which transform is causing the issue\r\n  - What input type it expects\r\n  - What input type it's getting instead\r\n  - What transform is producing that input type.\r\n  \r\n  I've simplified the error message to answer those questions a bit more directly, so now the above example produces the following error message:\r\n  ```\r\n  apache_beam.typehints.decorators.TypeCheckError: The transform 'Map(square_root)' requires PCollections of type '<class 'float'>' but was applied to a PCollection of type '<class 'str'>' (produced by the transform 'Create').\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  I've only applied this change to type hint violations for the main input, not for side inputs which I've left alone (though I think the \"based on...\" messages probably aren't useful there

change enables the configuration of a Callable function to populate the CDC mutation information on a per record basis when using BigQuery as destination with CDC writes. \r\n\r\nGiven that `beam.io.WriteToBigQuery` supports input data as `Dict` or `beam.Row`, the configured CDC info Callable should conform to one of those 2 types: `Callable[[Dict], Dict]` or `Callable[[beam.Row], beam.Row]`. \r\n\r\nExample configuration for Dict type data:\r\n\r\n``` Python\r\n    ...\r\n    data = [\r\n        # record: (name, value)\r\n        {\r\n            'name': 'cdc_test', 'value': 5\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            'name': 'cdc_test', 'value': 3\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n    schema = {\r\n        \"fields\": [{\r\n            \"name\": \"name\", \"type\": \"STRING\"\r\n        }, {\r\n            \"name\": \"value\", \"type\": \"INTEGER\"\r\n        }]\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    def cdc_info_fn(data: Dict) -> Dict:\r\n      return {\r\n          'mutation_type': 'UPSERT',\r\n          'change_sequence_number': 'AAA/' + str(data[\"value\"])\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n    with beam.Pipeline(argv=self.args) as p:\r\n      _ = (\r\n          p\r\n          | beam.Create(data)\r\n          | beam.io.WriteToBigQuery(\r\n              table=table_id,\r\n              method=beam.io.WriteToBigQuery.Method.STORAGE_WRITE_API,\r\n              use_cdc_writes=cdc_info_fn,\r\n              schema=schema,\r\n              primary_key=[\"name\"],\r\n              use_at_least_once=True))\r\n\r\n# expected data written on BQ table after pipeline finishes\r\n# {\r\n#    'name': 'cdc_test', 'value': 5\r\n# }\r\n\r\n```\r\nAnalogously, in case of processing Beam Rows the pipeline would look like: \r\n``` Python\r\n    ...\r\n    row_data = [\r\n        beam.Row(name=\"cdc_test\", value=5, route=3),\r\n        beam.Row(name=\"cdc_test\", value=3, route=3),\r\n        beam.Row(name=\"cdc_test\", value=2, route=1)\r\n    ]\r\n    def cdc_info_rows(row: beam.Row) -> beam.Row:\r\n      return beam.Row(\r\n          mutation_type=\"UPSERT\",\r\n          change_sequence_number=\"AAA/\" + str(row.value + row.route))\r\n\r\n    with beam.Pipeline(argv=self.args) as p:\r\n       _ = (\r\n          p\r\n          | beam.Create(row_data)\r\n          | beam.io.WriteToBigQuery(\r\n              table=table_id,\r\n              method=beam.io.WriteToBigQuery.Method.STORAGE_WRITE_API,\r\n              use_cdc_writes=cdc_info_rows,\r\n              primary_key=[\"name\"],\r\n              use_at_least_once=True))\r\n\r\n# expected data written on BQ table after pipeline finishes\r\n# {\r\n#    'name': 'cdc_test', 'value': 5, 'route': 3\r\n# }\r\n```\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master

Either way, this is a developer addressable error.\r\n  * If there are module errors, then those modules don't have access to a version of Beam Go, so instead install the latest released version of prism. \r\n    * This can be avoided by having a go.work file set up to direct Beam to a local version of the beam repo. This will be documented in a forthcoming SDK Development guide.\r\n \r\nArguably independently, is Attempt To Use Prism in the direct runner.\r\n* This currently only happens if we can't use the FnAPI runner.\r\n* If Prism fails on receiving the job, on job submission, then fallback to the DirectRunner instead.\r\n \r\nOther changes are a refactor to reverse a few if blocks and return earlier, improving readability and reducing indentations.\r\n\r\nPart of #32564\r\n\r\nFixes #32877.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
