What changes were proposed in this pull request?  \r\n- Fixed an issue where `short` values (e.g., `accessResult` field) were **not correctly converted to strings** before being written to ORC.  \r\n- Modified `castStringObject(Object object)` to properly handle `Short` values by converting them to strings.  \r\n\r\n## Why is this needed?  \r\n- Previously, `short` values were missing from the ORC output because they were **not handled in `castStringObject()`**, leading to incorrect (empty) values in the ORC file.  \r\n- This fix ensures that `short` values are correctly converted to strings before being stored in ORC.  \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?  \r\n- **Manual testing** by running the `main()` method from `OrcUtils.java`.  \r\n- Verified that the **accessResult** column in the generated ORC file now contains the correct values instead of being empty.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFew review comments were provided on KMS API metrics implementation but after PR merge. This JIRA addresses those review comments. \r\nReview comments: https://reviews.apache.org/r/74396/\r\nAll comments has been incorporated except one, that is to rename the API metrics. It may break backward compatibility if any product is consuming these metrics.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n-mvn clean install worked\r\n- Manually hit all KMS REST end points  (Docker setup) and captured the metrics json response and verified.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdding support for MS SQL Server - ranger database in docker.\r\n\r\n`2019-latest` is the version used from dockerhub: https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/mssql-server\r\nThere were issues with `2022-latest` image with missing libraries and issues in bringing the SQL server up, so using the `2019-latest` version in this PR.\r\n\r\nSSL is enabled in the image by default, the PR uses self-signed certs (and not certs from a CA) to setup db for `ranger` and `ranger-kms` services . \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThe patch required testing on `amd64` compatible architecture.\r\nCI step: `View sql server logs` shows database container logs after startup, no errors are seen.\r\n`ranger-sqlserver` container is in running state in the logs.\r\n`ranger-kms` completed installation with `ranger-sqlserver` successfully.\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-31T22:58:20Z","updated_at":"2025-01-25T00:40:58Z","closed_at":"2025-01-25T00:40:54Z","merged_at":"2025-01-25T00:40:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"bc4c95cddcccfe60f9d8c91b5917856406cc2c73","assignee":{"login":"kumaab","id":16475454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc1NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16475454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab","html_url":"https://github.com/kumaab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kumaab","id":16475454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc1NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16475454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab","html_url":"https://github.com/kumaab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5133652549,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAVRaiM8AAAABMf1SRQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/labels/testing%20complete","name":"testing

This allows restoring \"similar\" caches, not just exact cache hits.\r\n- Run `build-11` only after `build-8`.  If Java 8 build fails, no need to spend time trying with Java 11.  Run `build-11` and `docker-build` (test) concurrently.\r\n- Run the workflow on `push` for any branch.  This allows contributors to run the workflow in their fork, to get CI feedback before opening PR.  (Without pushing to `master` in their fork.)\r\n\r\nAlso, remove Apache repo definitions.  Without this, build was timing out.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RANGER-5066\r\n\r\n## How was this patch
