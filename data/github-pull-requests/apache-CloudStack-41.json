Table \"user_ipv6_address\" (UserIpv6AddressVO) is empty and will always be as it is a legacy code/table, not used in any IP \r\nallocation flow.

With that, the endpoint (management server) expects \"canUseForDeploy\" to be _true_; however, the returned value is false due to not finding IPv6 addresses available in the network, which makes the UI to not list those networks.\r\n\r\n**#3569 IPv6 code cleanup:** several PRs will be created in the near future aiming a complete cleanup on IPv6 code in order to avoid such mistakes to repeat\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nVM ingestion feature allows CloudStack to discover, on-board, import existing VMs in an infra. The feature currently works only for VMware, with a hypervisor agnostic framework which may be extended for KVM and XenServer in future.\r\nTwo new APIs have been added, `listUnmanagedInstances` and `importUnmanagedInstance`.\r\n### listUnmanagedInstances\r\nAPI will list all unmanaged virtual machine for a give cluster. Optionally, name for an existing unmanaged virtual machine can be given to retrieve VM details.\r\n**API request params -** \r\n`clusterid`(UUID of cluster)\r\n`name`(instance name)\r\n**Response -**\r\n`clusterid`\r\n`hostid`\r\n`name`\r\n`osdisplayname`\r\n`memory`\r\n`powerstate`\r\n`cpuCoresPerSocket`\r\n`cpunumber`\r\n`cpuspeed`\r\n`disk`\r\n    - `id`\r\n    - `capacity`\r\n    - `controller`\r\n    - `controllerunit`\r\n    - `imagepath`\r\n    - `position`\r\n`nic`\r\n    - `id`\r\n    - `macaddress`\r\n    - `networkname`\r\n    - `vlanid`\r\n    - `pcislot`\r\n\r\n### importUnmanagedInstance\r\nAPI will import an exisitng unmanaged virtual machine into CloudStack for a given cluster and virtual machine name. Service offering for the VM, disk offerings for volumes and networks for NICs of the VM can be mapped. Some optional parameters like projectid, domainid, hostname, details, etc can also be given. Appropritate networks, service offering and disk offerings need to be present before import and cannot be created on the fly during the API call.\r\n**API request params -** \r\n`clusterid`(UUID of cluster)\r\n`name`(instance name)\r\n`displayname`\r\n`hostname`\r\n`domainid`\r\n`projectid`\r\n`templateid`\r\n`serviceofferingid`\r\n`diskofferingid`(UUID of disk offering for root disk)\r\n`nicnetworklist`(Map for NIC ID and corresponding Network UUID)\r\n`datadiskofferinglist`(Map for disk ID and corresponding disk offering UUID)\r\n`details`(Map for VM details)\r\n**Response -** \r\nSame response as that of `deployVirtualMachine` API\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\n- A VMware added to running CloudStack with multiple hosts.\r\n- A new vitrual machine deployed from VMware vCenter with multiple disks, networks in the cluster.\r\n- At this point CloudStack does not show or control newly deployed virtual machine.\r\n- `listUnmanagedInstances` API is executed for the cluster. It shows newly deployed VM (deployed from vCenter)\r\n- Import API, `importUnmanagedInstance`, is executed, with appropriate service offering, network- VM NIC details and custom disk offerings for this unmanaged VM\r\n- On successful completion of import API, UI is verified showing imported VM. `listVirtualMachines` API is called to verify showing new VM and `cloud` database is checked for containing new records in `vm_instance`, `volumes`, `nics` tables.\r\n- Lifecycle tasks were performed on the imported VM - stop, start, reboot, migrate, attach new disk.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\n* After PR #3278 there was some changes on the channels. this does not seem like the problem. if we look to the VR XML file we see the following. the qemu guest agent must be the problem because the state of the VR is \"disconnected\".\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n   <channel type='unix'>\r\n     <source mode='bind' path='/var/lib/libvirt/qemu/r-1750-VM.org.qemu.guest_agent.0'/>\r\n     <target type='virtio' name='org.qemu.guest_agent.0' state='disconnected'/>\r\n     <alias name='channel0'/>\r\n     <address type='virtio-serial' controller='0' bus='0' port='1'/>\r\n   </channel>\r\n```\r\nafter investigation of the bootstrap process i think i found this problem. there is no startup from the qemu-guest-agent. we need them in connected state for the patch.sh script.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5433844/61913361-2d563100-af3d-11e9-9908-d4c2181fee66.png)\r\n\r\nthe problems seems to be the startup of the \"qemu-guest-agent\". since this is not an really systemd service more than an sysvinit. the service will be started with \"systemctl enable --now qemu-guest agent\". this will be redirected to systemd-sysv-install. normally \"--now\" should enable and start the service. i think with this redirection to systemd-sysv-install there is no option for the startup.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5433844/61913305-fed85600-af3c-11e9-8d89-cdb570b7a046.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5433844/61913349-1f081500-af3d-11e9-90b7-6a6d5c719d52.png)\r\n\r\n*

Description\r\nThere are certain scenarios where the 169.254.0.0/16 subnet is used for different\r\npurposes then CloudStack on a hypervisor.\r\n\r\nOnce of such scenarios is a BGP+EVPN+VXLAN setup using BGP Unnumbered where the\r\n169.254.0.1 address is used by Frr/Zebra BGP routing to send traffic to the\r\nneighboring router.\r\n\r\nThe following settings can be changed in the agent.properties (default values added):\r\n\r\ncontrol.cidr=169.254.0.0/16\r\n\r\nMake sure the global setting 'control.cidr' matches the values defined in the agent.propeties!\r\n\r\nIn the future the mgmt server can send this parameter to a KVM Agent on startup, but at the moment\r\nthis framework is not in place and thus these values can't be send to the Agent in a proper manner.\r\n\r\nFixes: #3488\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [x] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nRan local test on our cloud environment and verified cloud0 now has a different

Description\r\n\r\nWhen we change a global setting and it needs to be applied to all kvm agents, it would be nice that the new value can be propagated to all kvm agents (and save in agent.properties if needed) so we do not need to manually restart cloudstack agent or change agent.properties.\r\n\r\nit supports only \"router.aggregation.command.each.timeout\" for now.\r\n\r\nIn the future, it would be good to add a new column in \"configurations\" table to determine whether the configuration needs to be propagated to kvm agents.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that

Description\r\nCurrently when refreshing disk usage stats all kvm agents are asked to collect stats for all volumes. In setups with multiple kvm hosts where managed storage is used, not all volumes are attached to all kvm hosts, this results in a large number of warnings in the kvm agent logs. This change introduces a filter step in case managed storage is used so that the management server only requests kvm agents for stats about volumes that are connected to each kvm host.\r\n \r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nPicks up on the work of @niteshsarda on PR #2440\r\nSeparating API work from UI changes, for easier management and review\r\n\r\n**Requirement :**\r\n\r\nIntroduce a new API to collect and list CPU Sockets Metrics information for each hypervisor. Currently, listHosts API is fired for each hypervisor seprately to retrieve the count of CPU sockets. So, with this fix instead of multiple API execution, single API query will be executed to reterieve information for all the hypervisors.\r\n\r\n**Implementation :**\r\n\r\n1. Introduced a new API namely \"listCpuSocketsMetrics\", which will fetch details of CPU Sockets for all the hypervisors in a single run.\r\n2. In this API, a query will be fired on a host table to fetch details based on grouping of Hypervisor type and Hypervisor version.\r\n3. This API will prevent multiple calls of listHosts API and thus will improve performance of the infrastructure tab.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nFixes #3109 \r\n\r\n~This change fixes wrong event description with incorrect user and account IDs on account deletion.\r\nWhile deleting an account, existing code was using accountID to query User from cloud.user. This resulted in the wrong user and account details in the event description. This has been fixed by listing all users for the given account and then using the first user(this will be the user with lowest ID value and will correspond to default user for the account) for details.~\r\n\r\nAs per https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/3483#pullrequestreview-260554610, show only account details and nothing for user.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds

may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\nEvents on account delete,\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-07-11

Description\r\n\r\nWhen we create a vm in the network with redundant VRs, the lease file in the vm (for example /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.eth0.leases) shows the dhcp-server-identifier is the guest ip (not vip/gateway) of master VR. That's the ip ipaddress where the vm fetch password and metadata from.\r\nif we stop the master VR (then backup will be master) or restart the network with cleanup (VRs will be created), the guest ip of master VR changes so vm are not able to get metadata/ssh-key using the ips in dhcp lease file.\r\n\r\nSetting up metadata/password/dhcp server on gateway instead of guest IP in redundant VRs will fix the issues.\r\n\r\nFIxes: #3409 \r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

implementation of GenericBaseDao#searchAndCount() can result in incorrect count. This happens because the implementation of the GenericBaseDao#getCount method ingores the groupBy components of the search queries completely. This means the count returned will always be larger than\r\nthe actual count when not considering pagination.\r\n\r\nThe change to ignore the group by components was brought in b0ce8fd which also fails to explain the rationale. This was probably because the groupby would be executed after select count(*) has finished.\r\n\r\nFurther investigation of the getCount usage reveal they are always accompanied by search queries which include groupBy components via GenericBaseDao#searchIncludingRemoved method.\r\n\r\nCurrent code diff between search and count methods is as follows -\r\n```diff --git a/framework/db/src/main/java/com/cloud/uddtils/db/GenericDaoBase.java b/framework/db/src/main/java/com/cloud/utils/db/GenericDaoBase.java\r\n@@ -371,7 +371,7 @@ public abstract class GenericDaoBase<T, ID extends Serializable> extends Compone\r\n             clause = null;\r\n         }\r\n\r\n-        final StringBuilder str = createPartialSelectSql(sc, clause != null, enableQueryCache);\r\n+        final StringBuilder str = createCountSelect(sc, clause != null);\r\n@@ -384,19 +384,12 @@ public abstract class GenericDaoBase<T, ID extends Serializable> extends Compone\r\n             }\r\n         }\r\n\r\n-        List<Object> groupByValues = addGroupBy(str, sc);\r\n-        addFilter(str, filter);\r\n-\r\n+        // we have to disable group by in getting count, since count for groupBy clause will be different.\r\n+        //List<Object> groupByValues = addGroupBy(str, sc);\r\n         final TransactionLegacy txn = TransactionLegacy.currentTxn();\r\n-        if (lock != null) {\r\n-            assert (txn.dbTxnStarted() == true) : \"As nice as I can here now....how do you lock when there's no DB transaction?

After change the query executed is -\r\n```\r\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT  user_ip_address.id)\r\nFROM user_ip_address \r\n    INNER JOIN vlan ON user_ip_address.vlan_db_id=vlan.id  \r\n    INNER JOIN

If this port is not properly blocked by a firewall it could be really serious.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\nFixes: #3450\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n**Using 8080:**\r\nhttp://public.ip.address.acs:8080/client/api?command=listClusters&response=json&listAll=true&page=1&pagesize=20&_=1556128046728\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"listclustersresponse\":{\"uuidList\":[],\"errorcode\":401,\"errortext\":\"unable to verify user credentials and/or request signature\"}}\r\n```\r\n**Using 8096:**\r\n*Before the fix*\r\nhttp://public.ip.address.acs:8096/client/api?command=listClusters&response=json&listAll=true&page=1&pagesize=20&_=1556128046728\r\n\r\n```\r\nlisted all clusters of the zone\r\n```\r\n*With the fix*\r\nI was able to retrieve the clusters of the zone only when seding the API call via 127.0.0.1 IPv4 address.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl

Description\r\n\r\nJava methods getInterfaceAddresses()  returns ip addresses in reverse order as \"ip addr show\"\r\nIf there are multiple IPs assigned to a management interface, the last ip will be used as management ip in cloudstack. We need to reverse the ip addresses to get the first ip that makes more sense.\r\n \r\nFixes: #3311 \r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\nAdd a secondary ip to management interface in kvm hypervisor, and restart cloudstack-agent\r\nIn the past the hypervisor will use the new ip in cloudstack database.\r\nIf the new ip does not work, we are not able to access the console of vm on the hypervisor.\r\n\r\nWith this change, the ip in database will not be changed. cloudstack will still use primary ip.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document

master has sorting broken and the order reverses as opposed to\r\nwhat is set if sortkey.algorithm is set to true. The problem lies in the\r\nway the update APIs were being called by the UI. The code was agnostic\r\nto a global config that backend uses to set the order of the entities\r\nin the corresponding list APIs.\r\n\r\nWe need to make UI aware of the global config and instead of changing\r\nsign of sort key pass proper numbers so that DB isn't confusing when\r\nsome tables have positive sortkey and some have negative.\r\n\r\nThe fix is in 2 steps-\r\n1) Make use of sortkey name in place where it's relevant. Mere row index\r\nis not sufficient.\r\n2) Reverse the sortkey if we are sorting by descending (when global\r\nconfig is false)\r\nFix is general bugfix but I also verified that #2724 is also fixed after this change and verifiable. The DB support already existed.\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nThe following things are done in this PR:\r\n\r\n- Add the **compiling of the scss sources to css to the maven build for the client ui**. I used this (https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin) maven plugin for that.\r\n- This was required to **remove the css** files from the project. This is necessary, because it happened multiple times that the css files were modified directly instead of editing and then compiling the scss files, which results in a mismatch between the scss src and the compiled css.\r\ne.g. https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/3240/files\r\nI moved these missing changes into the corresponding scss files here.\r\n\r\n- This (compiling scss to css during the build) is the currently preferred way of handling these frontend resources.\r\n\r\n- This changes are not affecting any functionality nor are a breaking change.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [x] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nDeployed this to our test environment and tested functionality.","created_at":"2019-06-27T15:00:10Z","updated_at":"2019-12-08T18:12:38Z","closed_at":"2019-12-08T18:12:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9f7229667257054113211d116d73ea75e166a4d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"DennisKonrad","id":33484272,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg0Mjcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33484272?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisKonrad","html_url":"https://github.com/DennisKonrad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisKonrad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisKonrad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisKonrad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisKonrad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisKonrad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisKonrad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisKonrad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisKonrad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DennisKonrad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"GabrielBrascher","id":5025148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5025148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher","html_url":"https://github.com/GabrielBrascher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"PaulAngus","id":4810220,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MTAyMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4810220?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAngus","html_url":"https://github.com/PaulAngus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAngus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAngus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAngus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAngus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAngus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAngus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAngus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAngus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAngus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":37843364,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzg0MzM2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:bug","name":"type:bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":""},{"id":739374767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzkzNzQ3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:UI","name":"component:UI","color":"ea62a8","default":false,"description":""},{"id":821716113,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjE3MTYxMTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:cleanup","name":"type:cleanup","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/3434/commits","review_comments_url":

Description\r\nThe following things are done in this PR:\r\n\r\n- Add the **compiling of the scss sources to css to the maven build for the client ui**. I used this (https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin) maven plugin for that.\r\n- This was required to **remove the css** files from the project. This is necessary, because it happened multiple times that the css files were modified directly instead of editing and then compiling the scss files, which results in a mismatch between the scss src and the compiled css.\r\ne.g. https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/3240/files\r\n- I also **moved the ui folder** with the frontend resources inside the client ui module folder because they got only used there and it is a better location for them.\r\n- This (compiling scss to css during the build) is the currently preferred way of handling these frontend resources.\r\n\r\n- This changes are not affecting any functionality nor are a breaking change.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature

Description\r\nThis readds the custom.css file to overwrite the default cloudstack styles.\r\nCurrently this is only possible by adding them to the custom.scss in the repository and compile them into the cloudstack3.css.\r\nNow there is an empty custom.css created when compiling the scss source. This custom.css can be overwritten with the custom styles afterwards.\r\nThis functionality was broken by https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/3328.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking

adding iprange for VLANs there are 3 cases -\r\n1) VLAN under consideration has a tag (like 101)\r\n2) VLAN under consideration has a tag but as a range (like 101-124)\r\n3) VLAN is untagged (i.e. id is \"untagged\")\r\n\r\nBefore adding iprange we have to check for possible overlaps and throw exception. This needs to be done as follows -\r\n1) If VLAN Tag ID is numeric or a range we need to call `UriUtils.checkVlanUriOverlap`method which internally tries to expand the range as verifies if there are overlaps. If URI overlaps (i.e. there are overlapping VLAN tags) we then need to verify if the iprange being added overlaps with previously added ranges.\r\n2) If there are no overlapping tags we simply need to test for public networks being present in the VLAN.\r\n\r\nA Regression was introduced in https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/commit/41fdb88970d1a33d57ff08a3ecc239ec898956dc#diff-6e2b61984e8fa2823bb47da3caafa4eeR3174 which caused comparing 'untagged' string as a numeric VLAN Tag range and and attempted expanding it to test overlap in `UriUtils.checkVlanUriOverlap`.\r\n\r\nTo fix the bug in the issue, we need to handle the untagged case separately as it's non-numeric tag in code. For untagged VLANs and overlapping VLAN URIs we need to check for ipranges and gateways which happens naturally after this change. For tagged VLANs with non-overlapping URIs we need to check if there is a public network.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\nFixes: #3114\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
