Whilst there are some downsides to that it has elevated the amount of input validation and round-trip testing that happens.\n\nThis PR would be followed by a second to add `feature` metadata to expose which load balancers manage members by IP and which manage them by instance id. And also the backend port policy (a good few ignore Member.port). I'd love to write tests for these that validate consistency over the entire API, so i'd like to finish this PR

still needs actual testing, unittests and PEP8 checking, but is ready for some feedback on approach, factoring and function names.\n\nThe goal is that if I pass a NodeAuthSSHKey to ec2 (via `auth` argument of `create_node`), that public key will be automatically imported into the KeyPair system, if it hasn't been already.\n\nThis commit adds new utility functions for extracting fingerprints\nfrom public keys. There are 2 versions of this. It is quite easy\nto make an OpenSSH style fingerprint, but EC2 uses an SSH2 style\nfingerprint (which has extra DER encoding applied to it before\nhashing).\n\nThis commit allows you to import a public ssh key that you\nhave as a string (previously the key had to exist on disk).\n\nYou can now use ex_list_keypairs rather than ex_describe_all_keypairs.\nThe latter gives you a list of key names, you then need to do a\nHTTP request for each keyname if you want to check their fingerprint.\nThe former returns a list of dictionaries with more info.\nTherefore, ex_list_keypairs is much more efficient.\n\nex_describe_all_keypairs was reimplemented on top of\nex_list_keypairs, but I think it should be marked as deprecated.\n\nA new ex_ method is now available to find or import a public key.\nGiven a public key it will find it on ec2 by its fingerprint. If\nit is not available it is automatically imported.\n\nThe create_node method uses this method to lookup or import an\nSSH key that is provided to it by a NodeAuthSSHKey (via auth arg).\nThis means ec2 now properly supports the ssh-key feature.\n","created_at":"2013-08-02T16:30:38Z","updated_at":"2013-08-15T12:32:30Z","closed_at":"2013-08-15T12:32:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fc4b07ea1cec5693e7e61254b200d60788494e52","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/133/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/133/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/133/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/81e8e55615fb94c4581356fe3de3d48de7c59d47","head":{"label":"Jc2k:ec2-auth-support","ref":"ec2-auth-support","sha":"81e8e55615fb94c4581356fe3de3d48de7c59d47","user":{"login":"Jc2k","id":11544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k","html_url":"https://github.com/Jc2k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":1917628,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTE3NjI4","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Jc2k/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Jc2k","id":11544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k","html_url":"https://github.com/Jc2k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Jc2k/libcloud","description":"Mirror

pull request updates the metadata of `self.features['create_node']`.\n\nIt refactors `deploy_node` to not care about the metadata when authentication information is provided, this means EC2 and other users of deploy_node can continue to function even though they don't really support the NodeAuthSSHKey interface.\n\nIt turns out that `deploy_node` will generate a password for drivers that support `password` if auth is not provided. In order to not break that i've had to move the feature into the `create_node` implementations. So now any driver that supports `password` will behave like `generates_password` if no auth information is provided.\n\nIt adds a generic helper for making sure the right kind of NodeAuth object has been pased to `create_node`.\n\nThe PR also contains a few minor PEP8 cleanups in files i've touched.\n","created_at":"2013-08-01T05:12:28Z","updated_at":"2013-08-18T08:33:05Z","closed_at":"2013-08-02T16:31:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c8a3454072c3c923e6e6fd9713558e140342673d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/130/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/130/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/130/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/7909c81c9afca2477a1d21519a61c31fcb6953ae","head":{"label":"Jc2k:367-improve-feature-metadata","ref":"367-improve-feature-metadata","sha":"7909c81c9afca2477a1d21519a61c31fcb6953ae","user":{"login":"Jc2k","id":11544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k","html_url":"https://github.com/Jc2k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":1917628,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTE3NjI4","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Jc2k/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Jc2k","id":11544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k","html_url":"https://github.com/Jc2k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Jc2k/libcloud","description":"Mirror

branch adds a command line tool for updating pricing file (as discussed in the last design day). It includes the following changes:\n1. Modifies the pricing code, to read pricing data from `~/.libcloud/pricing.json` file, if it exists. If it doesn't it reads it from a pricing file which is bundled with a libcloud distribution.\n2. Adds a command line tool to download the latest pricing file from our git repository and saves it to `~/.libcloud/pricing.json` \n\nExample CLI tool usage:\n\n``` bash\n$ libcloud update-pricing [--file-path=~/.libcloud/pricing.json] [--file-url=...]\n```\n\nThe tool is non-interactive (so it can be used in a cronjob, etc) and it's very simple. It doesn't perform any update checks and it simply overwrites  the file at `~/.libcloud/pricing.json`. \n\nSince the pricing file is small, the current approach is imo totally fine. Adding extra code to handle \"only update if necessary\" by using hash comparison / modified-at or similar approach would imo just add unnecessary complexity with very little benefit.\n","created_at":"2013-07-30T15:42:02Z","updated_at":"2014-06-13T03:32:14Z","closed_at":"2013-08-01T12:44:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"923ca01168d68b4e44861384d9e6ff7f8849fbe3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/127/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/127/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/127/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/5bccc44c3321c5e624705ff28717a9b14565bcab","head":{"label":"Kami:pricing_file_changes","ref":"pricing_file_changes","sha":"5bccc44c3321c5e624705ff28717a9b14565bcab","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTA4NjI=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Kami/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kami/libcloud","description":"Apache Libcloud is a Python library which hides differences between different cloud provider APIs and allows you to manage different cloud resources through a unified and easy to use API.

handle `datacenter` kwarg with next gen driver and `region` kwarg with first gen driver\n- Updates Rackspace storage driver to correctly handle `datacenter` kwarg\n\nStill left to do and update:\n- Update affected compute tests\n- Update Loadbalancer drivers\n- Update DNS drivers\n- Eventually drivers which support that (every driver except first gen Cloud Servers driver) should be updated to

problem.\nCheers\n","created_at":"2013-02-13T06:07:32Z","updated_at":"2013-02-18T02:26:20Z","closed_at":"2013-02-18T02:26:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dcc4bd14c4a96a957ba1faa77156faa6a064b80a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/95/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/95/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/95/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/d33050335b8b1d82c136b642b72cba4b3a8a0f7e","head":{"label":"grischa:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"d33050335b8b1d82c136b642b72cba4b3a8a0f7e","user":{"login":"grischa","id":468227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODIyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/468227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grischa","html_url":"https://github.com/grischa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grischa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grischa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grischa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grischa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grischa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grischa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grischa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grischa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grischa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":8174121,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTc0MTIx","name":"libcloud","full_name":"grischa/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"grischa","id":468227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODIyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/468227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grischa","html_url":"https://github.com/grischa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grischa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grischa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grischa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grischa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grischa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grischa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grischa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grischa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grischa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/grischa/libcloud","description":"Mirror

id.\n","created_at":"2013-01-12T22:57:03Z","updated_at":"2014-06-17T20:02:56Z","closed_at":"2013-01-31T09:14:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d3ca2953556f3ef7de308be8b2a612c9694a0caf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/87/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/87/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/87/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/cabb01532cac46b8e95e0bcd099e9947f2058d89","head":{"label":"Jc2k:gandi-dns","ref":"gandi-dns","sha":"cabb01532cac46b8e95e0bcd099e9947f2058d89","user":{"login":"Jc2k","id":11544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k","html_url":"https://github.com/Jc2k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":1917628,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTE3NjI4","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Jc2k/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Jc2k","id":11544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k","html_url":"https://github.com/Jc2k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Jc2k/libcloud","description":"Mirror

Overview\n\nThis pull request is for implementing a CLI framework for libcloud. Libcloud does a good job of abstracting cloud operations. If this functionality can be made available via command line tools, it will be an added advantage for libcloud usage. Some other cloud libraries provide such functionality (Like Boto).\n## Design goals are to provide\n- Command line tools for all of libcloud's functionality\n- Command line options to control auth information\n- Ability to use config files (`/etc/libcloud.conf`, `~/.libcloud.conf`) etc. These options can be over-written via command line arguments\n- Support for logging (controlled via config files).\n- Provide different commands for each functionality\n  - `cloud_compute`\n  - `cloud_dns`\n  - `cloud_storage`\n  - `cloud_lb` (load balancing)\n- A hierarchical command structure within each command\n  `$ cloud_storage providers - list storage providers`\n  `$ cloud_storage container <list>/<create>/<delete>`\n  `$ cloud_storage object <list>/<put>/<get>/...`\n- Provide simpler to remember aliases for sub-commands\n  `$ cloud_storage container list/ls`\n### In future\n- Provide commands for other libcloud functionality\n- Provide support for output formatting (output as JSON/XML/CSV etc.) to make it easier for scripting\n## Implementation\n- For providing most of the functionality mentioned in design goals, the python cement library was used. (http://builtoncement.com/). This provides an excellent framework for solving our design goals. \n  It is tested for Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, and 3.2. However, I am not sure of it's support for Python 2.5.\n- As of now only the cloud_storage command is implemented.\n## Config file structure\n\nThe config file has to be either `/etc/libcloud.conf`,`~/.libcloud.conf`\n\n```\n[base]\nstorage_provider=s3_us_west\nusername=*******\naccess_key=********\n\n[log]\nlevel=NONE\nfile=/tmp/cli1.log\nto_console=False\nrotate=False\nmax_bytes=512000\nmax_file=5\n```\n## `cloud_storage` command\n### Lists the available storage providers\n\n`$ cloud_storage providers`\n### Container operations\n#### Lists available containers\n\n`$ cloud_storage container <list|ls>`\n#### Create a container\n\n`$ cloud_storage container create <container_name>`\n#### Delete a container\n\n`$ cloud_storage container delete -r -f -v <container_name>`\nBy default container is not deleted if it is not empty\n- If `-r` is provided, all objects are recursively deleted after being prompted for each object\n- If `-f` is provided, all objects are recursively deleted without user prompt\n- If `-rfv` is mentioned, each deleted object is mentioned in the output\n### Object operations\n#### List objects in a container\n\n`$ cloud_storage object <list|ls> -v <container_name>`\nList all objects in the container\nIf `-v` is mentioned, object size is also listed out\n#### Delete an object\n\n`$ cloud_storage object <delete|rm|del|remove> -f <container_name> <object_name>`\nDeletes the object in the container after prompting user for confirmation\nIf `-f` is specified, user is not prompted\n#### Upload an object from a local file or Unix pipe\n\n```\n$ cloud_storage object <put|upload|store|create> <container_name> <object_name> <local_file>\n$ cat /path/to/file | cloud_storage object put <container_name> <object_name> \n$ cat /path/to/file | cloud_storage object put <container_name> <object_name> -\n```\n#### Download an object ot a local file or unix pipe\n\n```\n$ cloud_storage object <get|download|stream> <container_name> <object_name> <local_file>\n$ cloud_storage object get <container_name> <object_name> > /path/to/file\n$ cloud_storage object get <container_name> <object_name> - > /path/to/file\n```\n### Other changes\n- Minor bug fix in S3\n- `setup.py` was modified to install the `cloud_storage`

patch adds support for streaming data upload using Amazon's multipart upload support as listed in [S3 docs](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingRESTAPImpUpload.html)\n\nAs per current behaviour, the `upload_object_via_stream()` API will collect the entire object in memory, and then upload it to S3. This can turn problematic with large files (think HD videos around 4GB). This will be a huge hit in performance and memory of the python application.\n\nWith this patch, the API `upload_object_via_stream()` will use the S3 multipart upload feature to upload data in 5MB chunks, thus reducing the overall memory impact of the application.\n## Design of this feature:\n- The `S3StorageDriver()` is not used just for Amazon S3. It is sub-classed for being used with other S3 compliant cloud storage providers like Google Storage.\n- The Amazon S3 multipart upload is not (or may not be) supported by other storage providers (who will prefer the chunked upload mechanism)\n\nWe can solve this problem in two ways:\n- Create a new subclass of `S3StorageDriver` (say `AmazonS3StorageDriver`), which implements this new multipart upload mechanism. Other storage providers will subclass `S3StorageDriver`. This is a more cleaner approach.\n- Introduce an attribute `supports_s3_multipart_upload` and based on it's value, control the callback function passed to `_put_object()` API. This makes the code look a bit hacky, but this approach is better for supporting such features in the future. We don't have to keep making sub-classes for each feature.\n\nIn the current patch, I have implemented the latter approach, though I prefer the former. After discussions with the community and knowing their preferences, we can select a final approach.\n## Design notes:\n- Implementation has three steps\n  1. `POST` request to `/container/object_name?uploads`. This returns an XML with a unique `uploadId`. This is handled as part of `_put_object()`. Doing it via `_put_object()` ensures that all S3 related parameters are set correctly.\n  2. Upload each chunk via `PUT` to `/container/object_name?partNumber=X&uploadId=***` - This is done via the callback that is passed to `_put_object()` named `_upload_multipart()`\n  3. `POST` an XML containing part-numbers and etag headers returned for each part to `/container/object_name?uploadId=***`, implemented via `_commit_multipart()`\n  4. In case of any failures in steps (2) or (3), the upload is deleted from S3 through a `DELETE` request to `/container/object_name?uploadId=****`, implemented via `_abort_multipart()`\n- The chunk size for upload was set as 5MB - This is the minimum allowed size as per Amazon S3 docs.\n## Other changes:\n- Did some PEP8 cleanup on s3.py\n- `s3.get_container()` would iterate through the list of containers for finding the requested entry. This can be simplified by making a `HEAD` request. The only downside is that `created_time` is not available for the container. Let me know if this approach is OK or if I must revert it.\n- Introduced the following APIs for the `S3StorageDriver()`, to make some functionality easier.\n  - `get_container_cdn_url()`\n  - `get_object_cdn_url()`\n- In `libcloud.common.base.Connection`, the `request()` method is used as the basis for all HTTP requests made by libcloud. This method had a limitation, which became apparent in S3 multipart upload implementation. For initializing an upload, the API invoked was  `/container/object_name?uploads`.  The `uploads` parameter had to be passed as-is, without any values. If we made use of `params` argument in `request()` method, it would have come up as `uploads=***`. To prevent this, the `action` was set to `/container/object_name?uploads` and slight modifications were made to how parameters were appended. This also forced a change in `BaseMockHttpObject._get_method_name()`\n## Bug fixes in test framework\n- While working on the test cases, I noticed a small issue. Not sure if it was a bug or as per design. `MockRawResponse._get_response_if_not_availale()` would return two different values on subsequent invocations.\n\n```\n     if not self._response:\n         ...\n         return self  <----- this was inconsistent.\n     return self._response\n```\n\n  While adding test cases for the Amazon S3 functionality, I noticed that instead of getting back `MockResponse`, I was getting `MockRawResponse` instance (which did not have methods like `read()` or `parse_body()`). So, I fixed this issue. Because of this other test cases started failing and they were subsequently fixed. Not sure if this has to be fixed or if it was done on purpose. If someone can throw some light on it, I can work on it further. As of now, all test cases pass.\n- In test_s3.py, the driver was being set everywhere to `S3StorageDriver`. This same test case is used for `GoogleStorageDriver`, where the driver turns up as `S3StorageDriver` instead of `GoogleStorageDriver`. This was fixed by changing code to

following limitations can come up while using libcloud in production - because of usage of C/C++ style `ENUM` based mechanism of registering drivers.\n- In a s/w setup which supports multiple cloud environments (or local), the admin/dev must be able to change the driver via a conf file. For eg: \n\n```\nstorage_driver = 's3'\nusername = 'pqrs'\nkey = 'abcd'\n```\n\n   In the current mechanism, the mapping of the driver name to number must be done externally.\n- There is no mechanism for dynamically registering a driver. It is quite possible that user's might have drivers which are for private cloud setups. They may want to install libcloud via PYPI, but use their own private drivers. Currently, there is no mechanism to do this without changing libcloud code.\n\nAlso, IMHO, the C/C++ style enumerations need not be there in python.\n\nThe solution for this is pretty simple to implement (given the good design of libcloud).\n1. Replace the `enum` numbers with strings. Given the usage of a dictionary for registering drivers, this will work out of the box.\n2. Implement a `set_driver()` API which can be used for registering new drivers.\n\nWith this change, libcloud usage can be controlled externally (via a config file or a db field etc.) as the admin sees

was implemented by issue (LIBCLOUD-78) for more efficient iteration over objects stored in a container (S3, CloudFiles etc. limit the maximum number of objects returned in a single call). \n\n`LazyList` solved this problem, but I think it might have the following issues while handling containers with large number of objects \n1. It loads the entire list to memory \n2. caller has to wait for the entire list to be loaded in memory before any operation can be done \n3. The api invocation using `get_more()` and value_list is a bit complex (as-in, it can be simplified) \n\nBy using python generators, the above problems can be alleviated. Results can be returned to the caller as and when it is returned from the server. \n\nThe following changes were done to the libcloud apis \n- A new api called - `iterate_container_objects()` was introduced. The storage drivers need to implement this instead of `list_container_objects()`. This API now returns a generator. Usage of this API will alleviate the above three problems. \n- `list_container_objects()` will simply do - `list(self.iterate_container_objects(container))` - this is maintained for backwards compatibility. It would be better if users can start using `iterate_**()` api instead. \n- The same changes have been made for the DNS base class also. \n- `LazyList()` can be removed from libcloud if it is OK with everyone. \n- The generator based interface can be used (WIP) for providing paginated access to objects - This will be useful for webpages/apps where the user has to paginate through the results. The same can be implemented by providing `start_key` and `count` parameters (similar to CouchDB) instead of generating the entire list and then doing an offset. This will be more performance/memory efficient than generating the entire list for every request.

idea is to provide a 'local' storage driver. This will provide developers with the ability to implement storage features with libcloud such that it can be deployed on a cloud platform or over local file-systems (for eg: over a local disk or a n/w mounted storage). This will allow for hybrid deployments where the storage layer can be altered via config changes. \n\nIn addition, this also let's users play around with the library without the need to access a cloud system \n\nA sample implementation could \n- use the 'key' argument as the base file-system where the objects will be stored \n- use a file-system hierarchy to represent containers and objects\n","created_at":"2012-11-02T09:28:44Z","updated_at":"2014-07-17T13:50:52Z","closed_at":"2012-12-27T05:03:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b82ce033607f7c932468eea27abccd45807226d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/74/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/74/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/74/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/abbef3abf337f84c219ae95069692abfae58f987","head":{"label":"mahendra:LIBCLOUD-252","ref":"LIBCLOUD-252","sha":"abbef3abf337f84c219ae95069692abfae58f987","user":{"login":"mahendra","id":115988,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTk4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra","html_url":"https://github.com/mahendra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5550733,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTUwNzMz","name":"libcloud","full_name":"mahendra/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mahendra","id":115988,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTk4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115988?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra","html_url":"https://github.com/mahendra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahendra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mahendra/libcloud","description":"Mirror

changed the openstack base connection and inheriting drivers a bit to make using the service catalog a little easier (hopefully).\n\nNow, every connection class that inherits from the openstack base connection must implement get_endpoint(), who's job is to return the correct endpoint out of the service catalog.\n\nThe upside to this is we don't have to generalize parsing the service catalog anymore, which makes it much easier to support things like regions or multiple endpoints of the same type.\n\nThe downside is that no other drivers behave this way, although you'll get a pretty obvious NotImplementedError if you do it wrong.\n\nI've also added a new driver for the rackspace nova private beta, which is a pretty simple reference implementation of how you would properly subclass the base openstack infrastructure to make a driver for a specific implementation. \n\nFuture TODO: Split out rackspace-specific code from the openstack base classes/drivers and create new providers for openstack implementations/regions.

situation?)\n","created_at":"2011-12-08T16:56:56Z","updated_at":"2011-12-13T22:04:57Z","closed_at":"2011-12-13T22:04:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d9fa633170c75da3c27dbcf4ac8180a13cb5185d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/41/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/41/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/41/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/a6cc70516341651d10ec7445aad12ab868d614d9","head":{"label":"tildedave:add_kwargs_to_lb_connection","ref":"add_kwargs_to_lb_connection","sha":"a6cc70516341651d10ec7445aad12ab868d614d9","user":{"login":"tildedave","id":405383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/405383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tildedave","html_url":"https://github.com/tildedave","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tildedave/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tildedave/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tildedave/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tildedave/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tildedave/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tildedave/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tildedave/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tildedave/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tildedave/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"5c16442d35ed4bd1fd49e4600499f872d0f40b95","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":419555,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTk1NTU=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"apache/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud","description":"Apache

THIS HAD TO BE DONE\n\nOpenStack Alpha at http://alpha.auth.api.rackspacecloud.com:5000/v2.0/ has started conforming to the spec and not returning any node data back except for new password on node create.\n\nSee: http://docs.openstack.org/cactus/openstack-compute/developer/openstack-compute-api-1.1/content/CreateServers.html\n\n\"Note that when creating a server only the server ID, its links, and the admin password are guaranteed to be returned in the request. Additional attributes may be retrieved by performing subsequent GETs on the server.\"\n\nSpecifically the OpenStack 1.1 node driver was failing on create_node as it was attempting to fill the information to create a libcloud node from the server response (which is not just returning ID and admin password).\n\nWHAT\n\nThe implementation I took here was to do the follow-up GET to get the node information.  There is enough information returned there to make a libcloud node object, though some of it won't be filled in until the server has gone from BUILD to ACTIVE (for example, ip addresses).\n\nI changed some of the create_node test data to match the existing asserts.\n","created_at":"2011-11-30T17:43:50Z","updated_at":"2014-06-15T14:53:11Z","closed_at":"2011-11-30T19:24:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"37d03d0b61cecbf7976db3bc324942f2db5f79bd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/40/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/40/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/40/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/e59e4d239dab29f326a72a5939c7fb9d378b38cf","head":{"label":"tildedave:fix_openstack_alpha_only_returning_id","ref":"fix_openstack_alpha_only_returning_id","sha":"e59e4d239dab29f326a72a5939c7fb9d378b38cf","user":{"login":"tildedave","id":405383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/405383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tildedave","html_url":"https://github.com/tildedave","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tildedave/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tildedave/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tildedave/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tildedave/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tildedave/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tildedave/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tildedave/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tildedave/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tildedave/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"6b774facb3570c1e879a4a53cef1c2fed3795712","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":419555,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTk1NTU=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"apache/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud","description":"Apache
