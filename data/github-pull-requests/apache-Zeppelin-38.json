What is this PR for?\n\nAdd impersonation support to JDBC interpreters, in addition to Kerberos Authentication to improve auditability in all JDBC interpreters.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Bug Fix | Improvement]\n### What is the Jira issue?\n- [ZEPPELIN-1212](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1212)\n### How should this be tested?\n\nIn JDBC interpreter setting add following properties\n- zeppelin.jdbc.auth.type = KERBEROS\n- zeppelin.jdbc.principal = principal value\n- zeppelin.jdbc.keytab.location = keytab location\n- enable shiro authentication via shiro.ini\n\nNow try and run any of hive's query (say show tables) it should return with valid results/errors depending on user permission.\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? n/a\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? n/a\n- Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\n\nThere is a native service used across the app to take care of re-routing to different page: `$location`, however there has been a few times where `$window.location` is used instead, and people tend to do it in new PR too.\n\nThis convert the `$window.location` from the code to use `$location`.\n\nOnly one was kept in `app.controller.js` for Iframe, so it doesn't flicker.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nRefactoring\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1183\n### How should this be tested?\n\nYou can try to reproduce the couple of cases that redirection is needed,\nbut overall there shouldn't be any issue from that change.\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\n\nWhile investigating the original issue, I discovered that the `printMode.css` file was never used before.\nI changed it so it is taken into account when printing, and added

What is this PR for?\n\nThis PR will fix [ZEPPELIN-1109](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1109). \nI'm not sure this approach can be the best way for fixing this issue since I would prefer to have the fade-in/out animation for bootstrap dialog. So if anyone has better idea for this, please let me know. \n### What type of PR is it?\n\nBug Fix\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-1109](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1109)\n### How should this be tested?\n1. Press `Enter` button right after clicking any bootstrap dialog (i.e. trash can icon in the notebook) \n   -> Bootstrap dialog will be shown up multiple times\n2. Apply this patch and [build `zeppelin-web`](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/tree/master/zeppelin-web#configured-environment)\n3. Try number 1 again -> you can see there is no fade animation so you don't have time interval to generate multi dialogs\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n- Before \n

What is this PR for?\n\nWorkflow process feature.\n(To ensure the success of each paragraph, it is possible to run consecutively.)\n#### Case 1\n\nThrough a dynamic form, you can execute the order in paragraph.\nThere is a difference with traditional methods.\nPlease check the following flowchart.\n![workflowdynamicformcontrol](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10525473/16791726/a4b96ff0-48fc-11e6-8e23-9ec577066bb7.png)\n#### Case 2\n\nIn general, when run a plurality of Paragraph, it performs Note entire run.\nThis is a good way to run a lot of Paragraph contained in the Note.\nHowever, the problem occurs if the Interpreter of Paragraph different.\n![notebook_example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10525473/16803203/175ad01a-4940-11e6-8949-72d0c49bdf9e.png)\nFor Paragraph each using a different type of one of the Interpreter Note but run in sequence, the end is all different.\n\n![normal notebook run](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10525473/16803193/069c4d94-4940-11e6-9293-888b6c6288a0.png)\nFor example, Markdown is a very fast Interpreter.\nThe process is completed very quickly.\nThis is a problem in the sequential execution Paragraph.\n\n![worklfow run](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10525473/16803192/06998122-4940-11e6-8f01-43cdf64f2eef.png)\nThis feature ensures a certain execution order Notebook with each Interpreter.\n##### Case 3\n\nFor concurrent job in the workflow ...\n\n![job_repl](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10525473/16828860/96e601b8-49ce-11e6-87d0-6f7fc30ce751.png)\n\nIf the current functional design is supposed to run at the same time, as follows \nIt is to share the results of the job.\nBut if the situation need to run the job at the same time, subject to their execution flow.\n\n*\\* The results will have to succeed, the following paragraph will be executed. **\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### jira\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1165\n### How should this be tested?\n\nDynamic form\nFor usage, see the following: \nhttps://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/manual/dynamicform.html\n\nIn the markdown type:\n\n```\n%md\n${workflow:workflow=MyWorkflowName,NotebookId01:ParagraphId01|NotebookId02:ParagraphId02}\n```\n- details explain.\n\nYou can specify the title work flow.\nSimply displayed on the UI. \n\n```\n${workflow:workflow=\nor\n${workflow:workflow=MyWorkflow\n```\n\ntitle name : MyWorkflow\n\ncharacter a comma(,), you can start working set.\n\n```\n${workflow:workflow=MyWorkflow**,**\n```\n\nEnter your Notebook ID and Paragraph ID.\n\n```\n${workflow:workflow=MyWorkflow,2BS99R6QA:20160712-163556_1475991024}\n```\n\nIn order to distinguish between the Notebook ID and Paragraph ID, characters <:> it is.\nThe example was set to run 20160712-163556_1475991024 paragraph with a notebook id called 2BS99R6QA.\n- how to get notebook id?\n  <img width=\"534\" alt=\"getnotebookid\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10525473/16795411/30faab1c-4918-11e6-8ef3-8b6fc6f6f039.png\">\n- how to get paragraph id?\n  <img

What is this PR for?\n\nIt had been pointed out in the mailing list that after https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/862, the execution time was changed to humanized fashion, while we would want to keep something more precise in that case.\n\nThis PR is rolling back to the old precise time for execution time.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1161\n### How should this be tested?\n\nRun a paragraph, after it is finished, it should show: `Took x seconds.` instead of `Took a few seconds` (or Hours, Minutes, Sec)\n### Screenshot\n\n![screen shot 2016-07-13 at 2 19 45 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/710411/16792626/0ff3ccb8-4905-11e6-89b6-a202944d66b8.png)\n###

But it would be better we set `safe_yaml` version for the other users. So I just updated `safe_yaml` version from `0.9.7` to `1.0.4` in `Gemfile.lock` manually. And confirmed that there are no compatibility issues with ruby version `2.3.0`(latest stable version), `2.2.1`, `2.1.1` and `2.0.0`(this version is no longer maintained by ruby). \n\nI also updated `docs/README.md` since we need ruby version higher than `2.0.0` not `1.9.3`. Please see [here](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/#requirements).\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nBug Fix & Documentation\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-813](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-813)\n### How should this be tested?\n###### 1. Apply this patch\n\n```\n$ cd docs\n$ bundle install\n```\n\nIf you already installed dependencies before, you need \n\n```\n$ bundle update safe_yaml\n```\n###### 2. Check what version of `safe_yaml` is installed -> `1.0.4` should be installed. Then\n\n```\n$ bundle exec jekyll serve --watch\n```\n\nIt should be run with no issues.\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? no\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\n- Does this needs documentation? no\n","created_at":"2016-07-12T09:29:18Z","updated_at":"2016-07-21T02:02:15Z","closed_at":"2016-07-21T02:02:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"11e03e74d6299849a96cac0d05077f99f41b8ac7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1167/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1167/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1167/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/458957d5b8f2b93e83d1a914ed2d4d782244b869","head":{"label":"AhyoungRyu:ZEPPELIN-813","ref":"ZEPPELIN-813","sha":"458957d5b8f2b93e83d1a914ed2d4d782244b869","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44792338,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDc5MjMzOA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"AhyoungRyu/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nWhile saving interpreter setting, if zeppelin server crashed/killed/restarted by user or there was some internet/download related (intermittent issue) because of which, or any other issue because of which dependencies were not downloaded.\nIn any such condition, when zeppelin is started/restarted, server should try and download dependencies.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Improvement]\n### What is the Jira issue?\n- [ZEPPELIN-1143](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1143)\n### SCREENSHOT\n\n![zeppelin-1143](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/674497/17025872/7d94d3e4-4f7b-11e6-9182-3e84f0badbab.gif)\n### How should this be tested?\n- Put a dependency (say \"org.apache.commons:commons-csv:1.1\") in any of the interpreter. \n- from command line delete `local-repo` directory\n- restart zeppelin server \n\nexpectation is `local-repo` should be recreated with all the dependencies that were mentioned in any of the interpreters.\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? n/a\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? n/a\n- Does this needs documentation? n/a\n","created_at":"2016-07-09T05:59:21Z","updated_at":"2018-02-25T03:45:37Z","closed_at":"2016-07-25T05:08:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"77dd97782ff946abbe71c494f42a41e3b20390d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1155/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1155/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1155/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/36cc81d79c9f79016ebfd01848150ec4df487770","head":{"label":"prabhjyotsingh:ZEPPELIN-1143","ref":"ZEPPELIN-1143","sha":"36cc81d79c9f79016ebfd01848150ec4df487770","user":{"login":"prabhjyotsingh","id":674497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDQ5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh","html_url":"https://github.com/prabhjyotsingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44664903,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDY2NDkwMw==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"prabhjyotsingh/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"prabhjyotsingh","id":674497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDQ5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh","html_url":"https://github.com/prabhjyotsingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/prabhjyotsingh/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nIn Zeppelin docs website, there are 4 dropdown menus(Quick Start, Interpreters, Display System and More) in the navbar. Especially **Interpreters** and **More** menu have lots of lists so I made this dropdown menu scrollable in #1004.\nOriginally the scroll bar is shown up when  a user is trying to scroll down. That's why it's hard to notice there are more menus in the dropdown menu.  See [this issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1085).\n\nSo I made this scroll bar always visible. But only for chrome & safari. Unfortunately, Firefox doesn't support custom scroll bar. See [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18317634/force-visible-scrollbar-in-firefox-on-mac-os-x).\nIn short, it says\n\n> There is no way to actually \"force\" Firefox render the old-style scrollbar since the default scrollbar used in the system is predefined by the OS itself (note that you can modify which scrollbar you want in System Preferences).\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### TODO\n- [x] : test this in major browsers\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-1085](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1085)\n### How should this be tested?\n\n[Build the Zeppelin docs website](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/tree/master/docs#build-documentation) in your local and check the dropdown menu in navbar. The scrollbae has to be shown right after you click **Interpreters** or **More** menu.\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n- Before : scrollbar is only shown up when you are trying to scroll up & down\n  ![before](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/16647507/8c6fbc60-446a-11e6-9a57-b00a76e6b59c.gif)\n- After : always visible\n  ![after](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/16647513/901e4e3a-446a-11e6-840b-599b6121fe46.gif)\n- In case of IE, you can always see the scrollbar. So it's not a problem originally. \n  ![screen shot 2016-07-07 at 5 41 27 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/16647584/e3708ff8-446a-11e6-8aee-c03eaba70cc9.png)\n### Questions:\n-
