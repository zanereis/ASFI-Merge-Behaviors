Please fill in the following information to help us review your PR more efficiently. -->\r\n\r\n## Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [ ] bug fixing\r\n- [x] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nIn the previous custom series. We can't do transition across different types of shapes. For example, we can't animate from a sector to a rectangle.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we bring the ability to do smooth shape morphing across different shapes. It's heavily based on the new add function in zrender https://github.com/ecomfe/zrender/blob/next/src/tool/morphPath.ts\r\n\r\nAn example of the transition between `map`, `bar`, `bubble` and `pie`(These are all implemented by custom series.)\r\n![Screen Recording 2020-09-13 at 10 27 04 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/841551/93020799-df552e80-f611-11ea-9d3b-1d28912b3dc5.gif)\r\n\r\nThe transition between hexagon and circle in hexbin example.\r\n\r\n![Screen Recording 2020-09-13 at 10 44 10 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/841551/93020993-f34d6000-f612-11ea-9537-1ec5220cfd03.gif)\r\n\r\nThe transition between different SVG paths.\r\n\r\n![Screen Recording 2020-09-12 at 10 42 27 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/841551/93021219-1f1d1580-f614-11ea-9802-37afadaa1ec6.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Are there any API changes?\r\n\r\nWe add a boolean property called `morph` in the returned element option in `renderItem`. With it enabled, the shape will be morphed from the previous shape smoothly when the type is changed.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```js\r\n// Render as rectangle at first time.\r\nrenderItem(params, api) {\r\n  return {\r\n     type: 'rect'\r\n     ....\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n// Change to a circle.\r\nrenderItem(params, api) {\r\n  return {\r\n     type: 'circle',\r\n     // Enable morphing from the previous rectangle.\r\n     morph: true\r\n     ....\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```","created_at":"2020-09-13T14:42:24Z","updated_at":"2020-09-22T03:10:01Z","closed_at":"2020-09-15T08:44:08Z","merged_at":"2020-09-15T08:44:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"9be4a3943250e7f0cdcf2b841af762fe97f0fe70","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1577042621,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTc3MDQyNjIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/labels/PR:%20author%20is%20committer","name":"PR:

changes over time.\r\n\r\nNote the difference between [`connectNulls`](https://echarts.apache.org/option.html#series-line.connectNulls) being `true` and `false`.\r\n\r\n#### Situation A: `connectNulls`: false\r\n\r\n`endLabel` is displayed on the last non-NaN data (that is `'-'` for data in option) when `connectNulls` is false.\r\n\r\n> The left column shows charts with xAxis as category and yAxis as value axis, with `xAxis.inverse` and `yAxis.inverse` being either `true` or `false`.\r\n\r\n![1

ClipPath Fixing\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes the clipPath used for initial animation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Are there any API changes?\r\n\r\n- [x] The API has been changed.\r\n\r\nA new option `series(line).endLabel` is supported, which is almost the same as `series.label` only that it has the following default values:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nendLabel: {\r\n    show: false,\r\n    valueAnimation: false,\r\n    distance: 8\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `show` is for enabling `endLabel`\r\n- `valueAnimation` is for value interpolation\r\n- `distance` is the distance between label text to the symbol item\r\n\r\n### Related test cases or examples to use the new APIs\r\n\r\nAdded a new test case `test/line-endLabel.html` and updated `test/line-animation.html`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\n### Merging options\r\n\r\n- [ ] Please squash the commits into a single one when merge.\r\n\r\n### TODOs\r\n\r\n- [x] Interpolating other dimensions of data.\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\n\r\nThese things should be fixed in future PRs.\r\n\r\n- State bugs\r\n  - When hovering the line near the end of animation, the normal text after animation is not correct\r\n  - State change from emphasis to normal during the animation\r\n  - Data items outside of the clipPath can be hovered\r\n- `endLabel` does not support polar system for this PR because I didn't find enough use case for this.\r\n- Interpolate when [`smooth`](https://echarts.apache.org/option.html#series-line.smooth) is `true`.\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-08T09:56:03Z","updated_at":"2020-12-28T08:45:53Z","closed_at":"2020-09-29T03:39:43Z","merged_at":"2020-09-29T03:39:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"b25e0511e361eed65d79202ed540ed7cd7f40a75","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2184417745,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTg0NDE3NzQ1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/labels/size/XL","name":"size/XL","color":"dddddd","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/pulls/13246/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/pulls/13246/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/13246/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/statuses/952f3c0a6ec9b78df3395c6aeccdccb752479aa0","head":{"label":"apache:line-label","ref":"line-label","sha":"952f3c0a6ec9b78df3395c6aeccdccb752479aa0","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9185792,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MTg1Nzky","name":"echarts","full_name":"apache/echarts","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts","description":"Apache

And fix the positioning of it to avoid to overflow the container, which will be cut.\r\n+ Fix the `tooltip.formatter` callback in `renderMode: 'richText'`, previously the concatenating rich text by `params.marker.content` does not work.\r\n   ```ts\r\n   formatter: function (params) { \r\n        return params.map(param => param.marker.content + param.name + param.value);\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n+ Refactor the implementation of `Series['formatTooltip']`:\r\nAdd a abstract layer named `TooltipMarkup` (see `tooltipMarkup.ts`) to describe the tooltip layout requirements for each series,\r\ninstead of lots of messy code to concatenate `html` and `richText` in each series.\r\n`TooltipMarkup` is responsible for generating `html` or `richText` finally.\r\nAdd `TooltipMarkup` is also in charge of sort the tooltip by `valueAsc`, `valueDesc`, `seriesAsc`, `seriesDesc`.\r\nWith the help of it, a typical tooltip description can be:\r\n    ```ts\r\n    formatTooltip(dataIndex: number) {\r\n        ......\r\n        return createTooltipMarkup('section', {\r\n            header: xxx,\r\n            sortBlocks: true,\r\n            blocks: zrUtil.map(indicatorAxes, axis => {\r\n                const val = data.get(data.mapDimension(axis.dim), dataIndex);\r\n                return createTooltipMarkup('nameValue', {\r\n                    markerType: 'subItem',\r\n                    markerColor: ...,\r\n                    name: ...,\r\n                    value: val,\r\n                    sortParam: val\r\n                });\r\n            })\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## PENDING\r\n\r\nDo we need to expose API (like `tooltipMarkup.ts#TooltipMarkupStyleCreator`) to `tooltip.formatter` callback, by which users can add richText style themselves. At present users is not able to do that.\r\nBut if we expose that kind of API, there is an issue:\r\nshould we use ZRender style (use `fill` to describe text color)\r\nor ECharts label style (use `color` to describe text color).\r\n\r\nLike\r\n```ts\r\nformatter: function (params) { \r\n    if (params.renderMode === 'richText') {\r\n        const valueStyle = { align: 'right', fontWeight: 900, fill: '#blue' };\r\n        return params.map(param => param.marker.content + param.name + params.wrapRichTextStyle(param.value));\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other info\r\n\r\ntest

feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThe PR updated way of parsing 7th part of date string from simply treat it as milliseconds to pick first 3 digits as milliseconds to avoid unexpected result when backend API return date string with precision of microseconds.\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n#13195 \r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nThough 3 digits milliseconds is widely used in most situations, some date formatter will return date string 6 digit microseconds (`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.micros`) . ECharts will treat micro seconds as milliseconds when parsing DateTime string and cause unexpected result.\r\n\r\n### After: How is it fixed in this PR?\r\n\r\nKeep conistent with default constructor of JavaScript Date - only pick first 3 digits when the length of input part between dot and zulu time marker is longer than 3 digits.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Are there any API changes?\r\n\r\n- [ ]

ECharts will treat micro seconds as milliseconds when parsing DateTime string and cause unexpected result.\r\n\r\n### After: How is it fixed in this PR?\r\n\r\nKeep conistent with default constructor

Details\r\n`calAxisNiceSplitNumber`: this function calculates `nice split` of each `value` axis. Because user can specify `min` or `max` to `axis`, `axis` might not be cut evenly.  It returns an array of `nice split`, find out the biggest one, apply to all `axis`, ideally, each `axis` has same `nice split` number (in most case which some option haven't been specified like `min`, `max`, `minInterval` etc ). \r\n\r\n`resetAxisExtent`: this function use `calAxisNiceSplitNumber` result to set `scale` again,  then get `axis` final split number(`finalSplitNumber`)\r\n\r\n`adjustValueAxes`: this function use biggest `finalSplitNumber` to calculate `unionExtent` which represent one unit split's length, then base on `axis scale extent` and `axis scale interval`, we can get that in this grid each `axis` proportion. multiply by `unionExtent`, it's final `axis extent`   \r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"661\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-09-15 at 23

Background\r\n\r\nWith Apache ECharts (incubating), it happens that sometimes only a small part of the chart has changed (e.g. when mouse hovers on a data point in a line chart, only the circle representing the data enlarges) but the canvas has to re-paint entirely. This usually has no big problem when the data amount is not large enough (like a few hundreds of graphic elements). \r\n\r\nBut for big-data, we have to consider the frame rate if we wish to draw hundreds of thousands of elements in a single frame. This is why ECharts introduced [hover layer](https://echarts.apache.org/option.html#hoverLayerThreshold). But hover layer has some limitations.\r\n\r\n## Problems Before\r\n\r\n- **Layering**: The hovered element isn't necessarily on top of everything else, but hover layer is always at top so the hovered element may be placed upper than some other elements by mistake.\r\n- **Translucency**: If the hovered element is translucent, the hovering style is rendered in the hover layer, while the old normal style was not cleared in the normal layer, so they are *overlaid* in an unexpected way.\r\n- **Memory**: It uses an extra canvas which takes extra member cost and may not be acceptable in some cases (like low priced mobile devices or when there are already many chart instances in a single page).\r\n- **Multiple Canvases**: Some platforms don't support multiple canvases, like NodeJS (on which a single image is expected to be generated) or Wechat Mini Programs.\r\n\r\nThese problems cannot be solved by hover layers due to its born nature with an extra canvas. \r\n\r\n## Dirty Rectangle\r\n\r\n> Dirty Rectangles are used extensively in computer/video game programming for fast, flicker-free double-buffer graphic updating.\r\n> *From [https://wiki.c2.com/?DirtyRectangles](https://wiki.c2.com/?DirtyRectangles)*\r\n\r\nTo solve the problem hover layer brings and ensure only necessary elements are repainted each frame, we introduced the dirty rectangle technique from game programming. \r\n\r\nThe basic idea is to calculate the bounding boxes of each elements changed in a frame and clear the changed area and render elements who have intersection with those bounding boxes.\r\n\r\n![dirty-rect (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/779050/90875500-d20ea080-e3d3-11ea-80d9-ed58079d663a.gif)\r\n\r\nThe rect rectangles in the above example shows the positions of calculated dirty rectangles. Only elements with intersection with those rectangles will be repainted.\r\n\r\n## Pros & Cons\r\n\r\nThis method helps most when most part of the elements are not changing in between frames while only a small part of them have changed. Typical examples that you **SHOULD** employ dirty-rectangle rendering are:\r\n\r\n- Elements style changes on hovering and there are more than thousands of graphic elements in a chart\r\n- A text/circle/rect/... element keeps changing color/position/opacity/... while most other elements are not changing\r\n\r\nOn the other side, if most of the elements are almost all changing overtime, it may take extra time calculating bounding box and rendering multiple times if there are multiple non-intersecting bounding boxes. So you **SHOULD NOT** use dirty-rectangle in those cases.\r\n\r\nFor charts with limited graphic elements, there shouldn't be noticable changes between using dirty-rectangle or not.\r\n\r\n## How to Use\r\n\r\nThe dirty-rectangle rendering is off by default. It can be enabled on init and is only useful when use `'canvas'` as `renderer`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar chart = echarts.init(dom, {\r\n    useDirtyRect: true\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nMost of the code changes happen in ZRender. So please checkout ecomfe/zrender#570 for more information.","created_at":"2020-08-21T07:50:30Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T08:46:50Z","closed_at":"2020-10-16T08:45:10Z","merged_at":"2020-10-16T08:45:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"8a17180072e1c84bb2a3a2c9189b8456cc4bdb1e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1577042621,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTc3MDQyNjIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/labels/PR:%20author%20is%20committer","name":"PR:

issues\r\n\r\n#13031 has described such a situation that user has provided `optionToContent` function while has not provided the corresponding `contentToOption` function.\r\nIf we think echarts should also work well in this situation, we need to make `contentToOption` function totally optional. (In other words, if user hasn't provided it, bugs like missing series data or showing a list of `undefined` should not happen.)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nIf user provide `optionToContent` function but has not provided `contentToOption` function, press 'refresh' will lose data and make a list of `undefined` displayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How is it fixed in this PR?\r\n\r\nEven user has not provided `contentToOption` function, by pressing 'refresh' button also works well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Are there any API changes?\r\n\r\n- [ ]

DESCRIBE WHAT THIS PR DOES. -->\r\n\r\nFix bug with bar race and move `realtimeSort` to be under `series` rather than axis and remove `sort` and `sortSeriesIndex`. The original bar race PR is #12484.\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- #xxxx: ...\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nWhen there is currently an interchanging happening, calling `setOption` will make one frame with wrong bar widths (which is the target width after animation).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How is it fixed in this PR?\r\n\r\nInstead of using `during`, this PR uses `zr.on('rendered')` so that sorting is done after a frame is rendered, rather than before. It can fix many other potential problems with bar race.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Are there any API changes?\r\n\r\n- [x] The API has been changed.\r\n\r\n<!-- LIST THE API CHANGES HERE

consist with it.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6800839/89612709-0dc54880-d8b3-11ea-8f3c-320bf1cf5aac.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How is it fixed in this PR?\r\n\r\n<!--

dataParams = seriesModel.getDataParams(dataIndex);` in my PR, and I found that `dataParams.color` is just the final result of color, no matter it is a function or a value, or user simply hadn't used `color` in `itemStyle`.\r\nAs a result, it is not necessary anymore to retrieve or do some transforming calculation from LegendView, just use this value.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-07T05:40:42Z","updated_at":"2024-06-19T21:05:15Z","closed_at":"2024-06-19T21:05:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"18433f5c13cc30e18cd58152f7010638fd1e2e40","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1389854612,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzg5ODU0NjEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"dd9933","default":false,"description":"Inactive

such a situation that user has provided `optionToContent` function while has not provided the corresponding `contentToOption` function.\r\nIf we think echarts should also work well in this situation, we need to make `contentToOption` function totally optional.

user provide `optionToContent` function but has not provided `contentToOption` function, press 'refresh' will lose data and make a list of `undefined` displayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How is it fixed in this PR?\r\n\r\nEven user has not provided `contentToOption` function, by pressing 'refresh' button also works well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Are there any API changes?\r\n\r\n- [ ]

Please fill in the following information to help us review your PR more efficiently. -->\r\n\r\n## Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [ ] bug fixing\r\n- [x] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport dataset transform for:\r\n+ Declarable and serializable data process config.\r\n+ Eanble to integrate thrid-party data process tool as a plugin of echarts.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n+ Enable dataset config transforms to generate new data source.\r\n+ Third-party transforms can be registered.\r\n+ A transform might have multiple input and multiple output. But in most cases, only one input and one output.\r\n+ Transforms can be piped.\r\n+ Parameters of transforms are declarable/serializable as possible as we can. Also callback might be supported if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n### General\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose we have a data:\r\n```js\r\nvar SALES_DATA = [\r\n    ['Product', 'Sales', 'Price', 'Year'],\r\n    ['Cake', 123, 32, 2011],\r\n    ['Cereal', 231, 14, 2011],\r\n    ['Tofu', 235, 5, 2011],\r\n    ['Dumpling', 341, 25, 2011],\r\n    ['Biscuit', 122, 29, 2011],\r\n    ['Cake', 143, 30, 2012],\r\n    ['Cereal', 201, 19, 2012],\r\n    ['Tofu', 255, 7, 2012],\r\n    ['Dumpling', 241, 27, 2012],\r\n    ['Biscuit', 102, 34, 2012],\r\n    ['Cake', 153, 28, 2013],\r\n    ['Cereal', 181, 21, 2013],\r\n    ['Tofu', 395, 4, 2013],\r\n    ['Dumpling', 281, 31, 2013],\r\n    ['Biscuit', 92, 39, 2013],\r\n    ['Cake', 223, 29, 2014],\r\n    ['Cereal', 211, 17, 2014],\r\n    ['Tofu', 345, 3, 2014],\r\n    ['Dumpling', 211, 35, 2014],\r\n    ['Biscuit', 72, 24, 2014],\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can make three pies like this:\r\n```js\r\nvar option = {\r\n    dataset: [{\r\n        source: SALES_DATA\r\n    }, {\r\n        transform: {\r\n            type: 'filter',\r\n            config: { dimension: 'Year', value: 2011 }\r\n        }\r\n    }, {\r\n        transform: {\r\n            type: 'filter',\r\n            config: { dimension: 'Year', value: 2012 }\r\n        }\r\n    }, {\r\n        transform: {\r\n            type: 'filter',\r\n            config: { dimension: 'Year', value: 2013 }\r\n        }\r\n    }],\r\n    series: [{\r\n        type: 'pie', radius: 50, center: ['25%', '50%'],\r\n        datasetIndex: 1\r\n    }, {\r\n        type: 'pie', radius: 50, center: ['50%', '50%'],\r\n        datasetIndex: 2\r\n    }, {\r\n        type: 'pie', radius: 50, center: ['75%', '50%'],\r\n        datasetIndex: 3\r\n    }],\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1956569/89036069-9c474080-d36e-11ea-9a8e-bbc3f163de0b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nOr:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar option1 = {\r\n    dataset: [{\r\n        source: SALES_DATA\r\n    }, {\r\n        // Pipe the transforms (filter and sort).

{\r\n    type: 'filter',\r\n    config: {}\r\n},\r\n```\r\nThe `config` is a \"conditional expression option\", can be:\r\n```ts\r\ntype ConditionalExpressionOption =\r\n    true | false | RelationalExpressionOption | LogicalExpressionOption;\r\ntype LogicalExpressionOption = {\r\n    and?: LogicalExpressionSubOption[];\r\n    or?: LogicalExpressionSubOption[];\r\n    not?: LogicalExpressionSubOption;\r\n};\r\ntype LogicalExpressionSubOption =\r\n    LogicalExpressionOption | RelationalExpressionOption | TrueFalseExpressionOption;\r\ntype RelationalExpressionOption = {\r\n    dimension?: string | number;\r\n    parse?: 'time' | 'trim';\r\n    lt?: OptionDataValue; // less than\r\n    lte?: OptionDataValue; // less than or equal\r\n    gt?: OptionDataValue; // greater than\r\n    gte?: OptionDataValue; // greater than or equal\r\n    eq?: OptionDataValue; // equal\r\n    ne?: OptionDataValue; // not equal\r\n    '<'?: OptionDataValue; // lt\r\n    '<='?: OptionDataValue; // lte\r\n    '>'?: OptionDataValue; // gt\r\n    '>='?: OptionDataValue; // gte\r\n    '='?: OptionDataValue; // eq\r\n    '!='?: OptionDataValue; // ne\r\n    '<>'?: OptionDataValue; // ne (SQL style)\r\n    reg?: RegExp | string; // RegExp\r\n}\r\n```\r\nFor example:\r\n```js\r\n// Parse time and then use arithmetic operators.\r\nconfig: {\r\n    dimension: 'Year', '>=': '2016-02', '<': '2016-03', parse: 'time'\r\n}\r\n// Logical expression option\r\nconfig: {\r\n    and: [{\r\n        dimension: 'Sex', eq: 'male'\r\n    }, {\r\n        or: [{\r\n            // support regexp, like SQL `like \"%Smith%\"` did.\r\n            dimension: 'Name', reg: /(\\s|^)Su(\\s|$)/\r\n        }, {\r\n            dimension: 'Name', reg: /(\\s|^)Smith(\\s|$)/\r\n        }]\r\n    }]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Sort transform\r\n\r\n```js\r\ntransform: {\r\n    type: 'sort',\r\n    config: { dimension: 'Price', order: 'asc' }\r\n}\r\n// or\r\ntransform: {\r\n    type:

Do we really ensure that the data process stage will never be modified in future?\r\n+ May be rarely used, if introducing a new concept that not friendly for junior users.\r\n\r\nThe solution for that scenario above:\r\n+ Introduce new features within the scope of \"legend component\". Enhance \"legend\" to support more flexible control.

Please fill in the following information to help us review your PR more efficiently. -->\r\n\r\n## Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [X] bug fixing\r\n- [ ] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nWhile rendering data for heatmap, judgement on whether data item will be out of current axis scale extent were implemented, and those items out of visible range will be skiped.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- #xxxx: ...\r\n-->\r\n#12969 \r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nAs original issue states, yAxis labels will be covered by color blocks (data series) in heatmap when `min` option was applied to `xAxis`. Actually these blocks should not be rendered since they are not in current extent of xAxis.\r\n\r\n![Before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3318968/87867484-b0c72880-c9bf-11ea-98b9-05610a65e80f.PNG)\r\n\r\n### After: How is it fixed in this PR?\r\n\r\nA judgement before rendering rect for each data item was added to calculate whether it will be in the extent, and rendering will be skipped if it is not in the extent.\r\nThis change also passed tests for scale changes cases such as using `dataZoom` control, using data zoom in toolbox, etc.\r\n![After](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3318968/87867209-588f2700-c9bd-11ea-9bce-af0f806332bb.PNG)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Are there any API changes?\r\n\r\n- [ ] The API has been changed.\r\n\r\n<!-- LIST THE API CHANGES HERE -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Related test cases or examples to use the new APIs\r\n\r\nNA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\n### Merging options\r\n\r\n- [X] Please squash the commits into a single one when merge.\r\n\r\n### Other information\r\nI have to admit that it's not a so perfect solution. A general solution for handling this case (judge whether dataItem is in the scale of current displayed coord) will sure be better but failed to find one, since I found that different series handle such kind of cases in different ways and hard to find a general one also applicable to heatmap. Feel free to comment if have any better idea.","created_at":"2020-07-19T05:00:05Z","updated_at":"2020-08-27T01:24:23Z","closed_at":"2020-07-21T03:24:35Z","merged_at":"2020-07-21T03:24:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"39bd739cdc2af551e053a4acfb33c8d9d94af11e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"pissang","id":841551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTU1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/841551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang","html_url":"https://github.com/pissang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pissang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2184416306,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTg0NDE2MzA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/labels/size/S","name":"size/S","color":"666666","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/pulls/12991/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/pulls/12991/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/12991/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/statuses/f8031efb797f258f9347d57cfeaf23de8c997753","head":{"label":"quillblue:fix-12969","ref":"fix-12969","sha":"f8031efb797f258f9347d57cfeaf23de8c997753","user":{"login":"quillblue","id":3318968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTg5Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3318968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quillblue","html_url":"https://github.com/quillblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quillblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quillblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quillblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quillblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quillblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quillblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quillblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quillblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quillblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:next","ref":"next","sha":"82015b76a1534cb9e1895122ceb49d138165f9a5","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9185792,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MTg1Nzky","name":"echarts","full_name":"apache/echarts","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"

Please fill in the following information to help us review your PR more efficiently. -->\r\n\r\n## Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [ ] bug fixing\r\n- [x] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n<!-- USE ONCE SENTENCE TO DESCRIBE WHAT THIS PR DOES. -->\r\n\r\n### Support `replaceMerge` in `setOption`\r\n\r\nProvide a new mode in `setOption` to support removal of some components.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, there are three mode about component update:\r\n\r\n1. `normalMerge` (already has)\r\n```js\r\nchart.setOption(option);\r\n```\r\nMost common used. The existing component will NEVER be removed.\r\nThe components declared in the input `option` will be merged to some existing component by `id`/`name`/`index`, or create new component if not able to be merged.\r\n\r\n2. `notMerge` (already has)\r\n```js\r\nchart.setOption(option, true);\r\n// or\r\nchart.setOption(option, { notMerge: true });\r\n```\r\nReplace all of the existing models with the new option, no state in models are kept.\r\n\r\n3. `replaceMerge` (new)\r\n```js\r\nchart.setOption(option, {\r\n    // specify component \"mainType\" here.\r\n    replaceMerge: 'series'\r\n});\r\nchart.setOption(option, {\r\n    // specify components \"mainType\" here.\r\n    replaceMerge: ['xAxis', 'yAxis', 'grid']\r\n});\r\n```\r\nThe specified component (by `mainType`) will be performed `replaceMerge`, others will go with `normalMerge`.\r\n`replaceMerge` means:\r\nWithin the scope of a certain `mainType`, the existing components will be merged with the new component declarations (in the input `option`) only if they have id matched. All of the other existing components will be removed, and all of the other new components will be created on the empty `componentIndex`.\r\n\r\nBy the mechanism of `replaceMerge`, we can remove a certain `mainType` of components, or totally replace them with new components, or partially replace and partially remain.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support option `timeline.replaceMerge`\r\n\r\nSee show case below for details.\r\n\r\n### Others fix and enhancement\r\n\r\n+ DataZoom enhancement:\r\n    + Including both \"slider dataZoom\", \"inside dataZoom\", \"toolbox dataZoom\".\r\n    + Make it works when some of the axis removed, or some of the dataZoom removed.\r\n    + Supports referencing axes by axis id.\r\n    + DataZoom supports referencing all axes by like `xAxisIndex: 'all'`, referencing none axis by like `xAxisIndex: 'none'` or `xAxisIndex: false`.\r\n    + DataZoom \"auto axis selection\" logic previously only work on the first `setOption`. Now make it works on multiple time of `setOption`.\r\n    + Some refactor to simplify the code.\r\n+ Refactor some of the component reference logic to make their logic the same in detail.\r\n+ Try to support the reproduce an chart instance in other chart instance in some simple cases (via `getOption`). The state of the chart instance (like zoom state) will be reproduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Show case\r\n\r\nPreviously, the interaction state can not be kept if using `notMerge` mode:\r\n![facet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1956569/87810660-ea007b00-c88f-11ea-85ab-60614d8b8741.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\nAt present, the interaction state can be kept when using `replaceMerge` mode:\r\n![facet-new](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1956569/87810731-043a5900-c890-11ea-9cfe-3b7eda63f30a.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\nAt present, we are able to add and remove coordinate systems freely, and make dataZoom controls axis as expected. That might be some basic of storytelling demo. Previously, there were several bugs not also about coord sys but also about toolbox and dataZoom:\r\n![transition](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1956569/87810763-11efde80-c890-11ea-9056-3eebd92f8c90.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\nAt present, series can be removed, while other not related series and  components keeping their state:\r\n\r\n![dynamic-series](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1956569/87810792-1f0ccd80-c890-11ea-8f83-8262390492fe.gif)\r\n\r\nPreviously, there is a timeline bug when different time tick has different number of series (series can be added but can not be reduced):\r\n![timeline-dy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1956569/87810810-259b4500-c890-11ea-82cf-84209c6bfbe3.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\nAt present, series can be removed in timeline:\r\n![timeline-dy-new](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1956569/87810821-2c29bc80-c890-11ea-8aa1-be9b8fff3d91.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related test cases\r\n<test/option-replaceMerge2.html>\r\n<test/option-replaceMerge.html>\r\n<test/dataZoom-feature.html>\r\n\r\n## Memento\r\n\r\n### Whether to change the component index after other components removed?\r\n\r\nThe questions is: whether the `componentIndex` of should be changed after some component removed via `setOption` in `replaceMode`.\r\n\r\nThere has been some [discussion](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r5b22dbf848080b5d5842f9c423ca5a2034e015bc107531bd0071bc0a%40%3Cdev.echarts.apache.org%3E) about it, but not clear at that time because not touch the code enough then.\r\n\r\nAfter trying to implement it, found something more clearly:\r\nSuppose there has been component: [A, B, C, D].\r\nThat means: A.componentIndex === 0, B.componentIndex === 1, ...\r\nThen call `setOption` in `replaceMerge` mode to remove B, C and add X.\r\n\r\n#### Strategy of change the index\r\nThe final component indices may be like: [A, X, D], or it also may be [A, D, X].\r\nThere might be no easy and intuitive way to make users aware what the final indices are.\r\n\r\n#### Strategy of keep the index\r\nThe final component indices may be like: [A, X, -, D], or it also may be [A, -, -, D, X].\r\nUsers are also not easy to know what D.componentIndex is. But at lease, users can know that the existing A and D do not change their componentIndex. Thus the \"index reference\" (like xAxisIndex, yAxisIndex) in option about A and D will not be broken.\r\n\r\nSo we can probably found that:\r\n(1) In either of the two strategy, users are probably not able to know clearly what the final indices like if the second `setOption` both added and removed something. Therefore, if users meet this kind of scenario, it's not a good idea to use index to reference components. On the contrary, using id should be recommended.\r\n(2) [strategy_keep_index] do not break the previous \"index reference\".\r\n(3) [strategy_change_index] might make the code more brittle, because it forbids any of the persistence (like hash map key) are relevant to `componentIndex`, `seriesIndex` (because it might be changed). It not easy to always ensure that and might not easy to be found in test stage.\r\n\r\nSo finally, chose [strategy_keep_index]. And in this strategy, the \"hole\" might exists. New components are first to fill the hole.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TODO: Do we need `notMerge: ['xxx']`\r\n`notMerge: ['series']` seems more intuitive than `replaceMerge: ['series']` when just need to totally replace series.\r\nAnd if we only want to **reset** a type of components, \r\nif we use `replaceMerge: ['dataZoom']`, we need to make sure `id` is not specified or change a different `id`.\r\nComparatively `notMerge: ['dataZoom']` is easy a bit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TODO: about the \"Restore\" feature\r\n\"Restore\" feature means the `toolbox.feature.restore` and the action \"restore\".\r\nPreviously the implementation of \"restore\" is not a complete solution, because after the second `setOption`, in some case it can not restore to exactly the original state.\r\nThe reason is, the original requirement expect that \"only restore the user interaction\" but \"do not restore the `setOption` result\" (`setOption` is always used to update the data).\r\nIf these things below happen one by one:\r\n\r\n`orgianl_state` => `user_zoom_data_1` => `call_setOption_updated_data_1` => `user_zoom_data_2` => `call_setOption_updated_data_2`\r\n\r\nAfter \"restore\" click, we expect the final state exactly the same as:\r\n`orgianl_state` => `call_setOption_updated_data_1` => `call_setOption_updated_data_2`\r\n\r\nThe previous implementation is temporary and not totally correct and not easy to be enhanced to support the new feature \"replaceMerge\".\r\nSo we do not support it at present and remove the support of \"restore\" after the second `setOption` temporarily.\r\nThat is a **TODO** .\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nRelated issues: #6202 #4356 #4033 #8246 #3002\r\n\r\n[related

Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [ ] bug fixing\r\n- [x] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nCurrently, we use the `animationUpate` options in series to transit the elements when data updated.\r\n\r\nBut in the case which user can trigger the update frequently, like dataZoom, resize. The long animation duration may let chart seems to be not responsive. Especially when we changed the default easing from `'cubicOut'` to `'cubicInOut'`.  \r\n\r\nSo this pull request can let dataZoom and resize pass global animation config through payload. And when series do update, it will use the config in the payload instead of the animation config in the series. It will make the update faster, more responsive, and neater.\r\n\r\n## Result\r\n\r\n### DataZoom with Mouse Pan\r\n\r\n####

[5.0] [FEATURE] Introduce more states in echarts\r\n## Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces more states and user interactions in echarts.  Which includes:\r\n\r\n1. Add `blur` and `select` state to all series. These two states have the same styling configuration with the original `emphasis` state\r\n2. Blur others when highlighting specified data through mouseover or hover linking.\r\n3. Unify different state configurations in series. Like `highlightPolicy`, `focusNodeAdjacency`. `hoverOffset`\r\n4. Click to select the data and apply `select` state.\r\n\r\n## Detail Changes\r\n\r\n### 1. Introduce `blur` and `select` state in all series.\r\n\r\n+ `blur` state is used when other elements fade out during the focus of some elements.\r\n+ `select` state is used when some element is selected by click.\r\n\r\n### 2. Add `focus` and `blurScope` to support focus effect when mouseover\r\n\r\n#### focus:\r\n\r\n`focus` defines which elements to keep not being blurred. It can be:\r\n\r\nIn commons series:\r\n\r\n+ `'self'` Only the data highlighted.\r\n+ `'series'` The whole series which highlighted data belongs to.\r\n\r\nIn the special series:\r\n+ `'adjacency'` Adjacency node and edges in the graph. Available in sankey / graph series. It's same with `focusNodeAdjacency` in 4.0\r\n+ `'ancestor' | 'descendant'` Ancestor / Descendant nodes in tree. Available in tree / treemap / sunburst series. It's same with `highlightPolicy` in 4.0\r\n\r\n#### blurScope:\r\n\r\n`blurScope` defines which elements in this scope will be blurred. It can be:\r\n\r\n+ `'series'` Blur the data in the series which highlighted data belongs to.\r\n+ `'coordinateSystem'` Blur the data in the coordinate system which highlighted data belongs to.\r\n+ `'global'` Blur all other data.\r\n\r\n### 3. Unify different state configurations from 4.0 and provide a more consistent option design.\r\n\r\n#### 1) `sunburst` series:\r\n\r\n+ `downplay` state is replaced by `blur` state. `highlight` state is removed.\r\n\r\n+ `highlightPolicy` is replaced by\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nemphasis: {\r\n  focus: 'descendant' | 'ancestor' | 'self'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's supported in `treemap` and `tree` series which uses tree structure data now.\r\n\r\n#### 2) In `graph`, `sankey` series:\r\n\r\n`focusNodeAdjacency` is replaced by:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nemphasis: {\r\n  focus: 'adjacency' | 'self'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 3) `pictorialBar`, `scatter`, `effectScatter`, `line`, `pie`, `boxplot`, `tree`\r\n\r\n`hoverAnimation` is replaced by:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nemphasis: {\r\n  scale: boolean\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`hoverOffset` is replaced by:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nemphasis: {\r\n  scaleSize: number\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4. Provide data selection ability to all series.\r\n\r\nAll series can use `selectedMode` option to turn on data selection by click, which is only available in pie and map before.\r\n\r\nValues supported:\r\n+ `'single'`: Only one data in series can be selected.\r\n+ `'multiple'`: Multiple data in series can be selected.\r\n+ `true`: Same with `'single'`\r\n+ `false`: Disable data selection. Which is by default.\r\n\r\n#### Data selection action and event\r\n\r\n##### action\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ndispatchAction({\r\n  type: 'select'\r\n  seriesIndex?: number | number[]\r\n  name?: string | string[]\r\n  dataIndex?: number | number[]\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ndispatchAction({\r\n  type: 'unselect'\r\n  seriesIndex?: number | number[]\r\n  name?: string | string[]\r\n  dataIndex?: number | number[]\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### event\r\n```ts\r\n{\r\n  type: 'selectchanged',\r\n  // same with brush event\r\n  selected: {\r\n      seriesIndex: number\r\n      dataType?: string\r\n      dataIndex: number[]\r\n  }[]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example: \r\n```ts\r\n{\r\n  type: 'selectchanged',\r\n  selected: [ { seriesIndex: 0, dataIndex: [ 0, 1 ] } ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPie and map select action and event in 4.0 has been deprecated, which includes:\r\n\r\n##### actions\r\n\r\n`pieToggleSelect`, `pieSelect`, `pieUnSelect`, `mapToggleSelect`, `mapSelect`,

[5.0][FEATURE] Label enhancement and state transition\r\n\r\n## Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces following main features:\r\n\r\n1. Better displayed labels.\r\n2. Introduce `labelLayout` for a more flexible label layout.\r\n3. Support `labelLine` on all series.\r\n4. State transition.\r\n\r\nState transition feature is developed in this branch because it's related to label on many codes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 1. Better displayed labels.\r\n\r\nIt includes several strategies to make sure the labels are displayed nicely and neatly by default in most cases.\r\n\r\n### 1) Smarter color strategy\r\n\r\nIt has better strategy to calculate the `fill` and `stroke` color based on the color of underlying elements, background color and label position.\r\n\r\n#### Text inside the rect\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/841551/86526867-ca4e7780-becb-11ea-96a8-9ec38e5e2976.gif\" width=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n#### Text outside\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/841551/86526877-e8b47300-becb-11ea-8382-c041b05ba679.gif\" width=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n### 2) Smarter label placement in Pie.\r\n\r\nRelated issues: [#6050](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/issues/6050)\r\n\r\n#### An extreme case from Gallery\r\n\r\nCase from https://gallery.echartsjs.com/editor.html?c=xSkDzAue4G\r\n\r\n##### Before:\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/841551/86513570-c411ba00-be3d-11ea-88f2-e5d87a53ead4.png\" width=\"700\" />\r\n\r\n##### After:\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/841551/86513588-f1f6fe80-be3d-11ea-8ec0-aeb724fa12ab.png\" width=\"700\" />\r\n\r\n##### GIF to show how labels will be hidden or truncated when it's overlapped or overflow.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/841551/86513757-61b9b900-be3f-11ea-9b71-cf5a9cbc7aa2.gif\" width=\"700\" />\r\n\r\n### 3) Overflow\r\n\r\nAdd `overflow` configuration. Which can be `truncate`, `break`, `breakAll`.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nlabel: {\r\n    overflow?: 'truncate' | 'break' | 'breakAll'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Truncate\r\n<img width=\"502\" alt=\"overflow-truncate\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/841551/86528799-12769580-bede-11ea-9afc-d00d32ceb4a8.png\">\r\n\r\n#### Break\r\n<img width=\"507\" alt=\"overflow-break\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/841551/86528801-14405900-bede-11ea-9970-478fcd2fb806.png\">\r\n\r\nThe difference between `'break'` and `'breakAll'` is `breakAll` will break the word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 2. Introduce `labelLayout` for a more flexible overall label layout.\r\n\r\n`labelLayout` provides more abilities for developers to tweak the layout of the labels after it's originally positioned by the chart itself.\r\n\r\nIt's available for all series.\r\n\r\n### Interface Defninition\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n{\r\n    /**\r\n     * Overall label layout option in label layout stage.\r\n     * All series can use this config.\r\n     */\r\n    labelLayout?: LabelLayoutOption | LabelLayoutOptionCallback\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface LabelLayoutOption {\r\n    /**\r\n     * If move the overlapped label.

Like following:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/841551/86527159-dbe54e80-bece-11ea-8d38-370968ba882e.png\" width=\"400\" />\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlabelLayout: function (params) {\r\n    const isLeft = params.labelRect.x < chart.getWidth() / 2;\r\n    const points = params.labelLinePoints;\r\n    // Update the end point.\r\n    points[2][0] = isLeft\r\n        ? params.labelRect.x\r\n        : params.labelRect.x + params.labelRect.width;\r\n\r\n    return {\r\n        labelLinePoints: points\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on this callback, we can tweak the label position in a few lines. For example, add a gap between the line end and label.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlabelLayout: function (params) {\r\n    const isLeft = params.labelRect.x < chart.getWidth() / 2;\r\n    const points = params.labelLinePoints;\r\n    const gap = 5;\r\n    // Update the end point.\r\n    points[2][0] = isLeft\r\n        ? params.labelRect.x - gap\r\n        : params.labelRect.x + params.labelRect.width + gap;\r\n    return {\r\n        labelLinePoints: points\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/841551/86527206-6463ef00-becf-11ea-965c-4dc049fb53a9.png\" width=\"400\" />\r\n\r\n#### 5) Draggable label.\r\n\r\nThe labels can be dragged to a different position if users don't satisify the original layout. And the labelLine will be recalculated automatically.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/841551/86528535-8fecd680-bedb-11ea-98a9-68d1a7cc4674.gif\" width=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlabelLayout: {\r\n    draggable: true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3. Support `labelLine` on all series.\r\n\r\nRelated issues: [#11534](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/issues/11534)\r\n\r\nlabelLine is very useful for guiding element to related labels when labels are moved far away, like the case of the aligned labels above.\r\n\r\n### 1) Auto calculated labelLine points.\r\n\r\nThe points of labelLine are calculated based on the position of the label and shape of the element. To make sure the display of labelLine is nice and neat.\r\n\r\n### 2) Support limiting labelLine angle\r\n\r\n### 3) Optimizing smooth algorithm\r\n\r\n\r\n## 4. State transition\r\n\r\nIt provides smoooth state transition when the mouse entered / leaved the element.\r\n\r\n#### Before:\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"map-state-no-transition\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/841551/86527514-04227c80-bed2-11ea-8099-ed15972dc9d4.gif\" width=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n#### After:\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"map-state-transition\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/841551/86527509-efde7f80-bed1-11ea-9e7e-b7b6e22b26f0.gif\" width=\"600\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n### Interface:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nstateAnimation?: {\r\n    duration?: number\r\n    easing?: AnimationEasing\r\n    delay?: number\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 5. Other optimizations\r\n\r\n### Animation.\r\n\r\n##### 1) Pie animation optimization\r\n\r\nRelated issue: [#12553](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/issues/12553)\r\n\r\n##### 2) Bar animation optimization\r\n\r\nRelated issue: [#12543](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/issues/12543)\r\n\r\n##### 3) Use `cubicInOut` easing by default\r\n\r\n###  Introduce dark mode.\r\n\r\nThe dark mode is inferenced from the background automatically by default. We can also specify it manually if we have an image background which echarts can't pick a color from.\r\n\r\n```js\r\noption = {\r\n    darkMode: true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs described above, the color of labels will be different in dark mode.\r\n\r\n## 6. TODO\r\n\r\n1. More layouting algorithms, like space searching with simulated annealing.\r\n2. More labelLine calculation restrictions. Like fixed anchor point.\r\n3. Specify priority when hiding the overlapped labels.\r\n4. Not show labelLine automatically if label is overlapped with the corresponding element.\r\n5. Remember the position after dragged in the option. Remembered position can be relative or absolute.\r\n\r\n## 7. PS\r\n\r\nAdded rich text support in SVG rendering mode.","created_at":"2020-07-05T07:23:37Z","updated_at":"2021-05-13T05:32:50Z","closed_at":"2020-07-06T11:23:18Z","merged_at":"2020-07-06T11:23:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"4c3b1b267b6f3a0b003860b8e59c09f7fa791891","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1577042621,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTc3MDQyNjIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/labels/PR:%20author%20is%20committer","name":"PR:

feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n<!-- USE ONCE SENTENCE TO DESCRIBE WHAT THIS PR DOES. -->\r\nAdded support for specifying initial map options, such as `minZoom`, `maxZoom`, `enableHighResolution`, `enableAutoResize` and `enableMapClick`. Note that `mapType` is not supported, can use `bmap.setMapType(MapType)` instead.\r\nhttps://lbsyun.baidu.com/cms/jsapi/reference/jsapi_reference.html#a0b1\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n- #6902\r\n- #8422\r\n- #8806\r\n- #11802\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\n<!-- DESCRIBE THE BUG OR REQUIREMENT HERE. -->\r\nSince Baidu Map sets `enableMapClick` as `true` by default, the POI's icon will be clickable when using ECharts bmap extension.\r\nThis option can't be dynamically changed in runtime. We want to disable it to improve experience sometimes.\r\n\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE.

FIXING AND A SIMPLE EXPLANATION ABOUT HOW IT IS FIXED. -->\r\nBy specifying `enableMapClick` for `false`, POIs on map will be unclickable as we expect.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nbmap: {\r\n    center:

changes?\r\n\r\n- [x] The API has been changed.\r\n\r\n<!-- LIST THE API CHANGES HERE -->\r\n- added a new option named `mapOptions`.\r\n\r\n### Related test cases or examples to use the new

feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n<!-- USE ONCE SENTENCE TO DESCRIBE WHAT THIS PR DOES. -->\r\n\r\nImproves label formatting for time axes.\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- #xxxx: ...\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before & After\r\n\r\n*The \"After\" parts are at proposals stage by now.*\r\n\r\n#### 1. Default time axis labels don't have nice format and display information not so important\r\n\r\n##### Before:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"725\" alt=\"屏幕快照 2020-06-29 13 50 11\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/779050/85977635-91b42700-ba0f-11ea-9f10-fc926cacac2f.png\">\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    xAxis: {\r\n        type: 'time',\r\n        interval: DAY / 4,\r\n        axisLabel: {} // default\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example, in [the above case](https://gallery.echartsjs.com/editor.html?c=xkPHcJp2be&v=2), labels of each day are all in the format of `MM-DD\\nYYYY`, but the months and years are all the same so they should not be displayed so many times to distract users for the real important information: date.\r\n\r\n##### After:\r\n\r\nThe default result of the above case have the interval of 6 hours, thus default hour formatter (may be `'hh:mm'`) should be used to display labels in hours and day formatter (`'YYYY-MM-DD'`) be used when day changes. This is the expected result:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"725\" alt=\"屏幕快照 2020-06-29 13 50 11副本\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/779050/85980069-43555700-ba14-11ea-8021-10605199a98d.png\">\r\n\r\nAnd the default style of the primary level (like day in this case) and secondary level (hour in this case) are different (maybe we can use a lighter text color for secondary level labels) and can be customized though [axisLabel.rich](https://echarts.apache.org/option.html#xAxis.axisLabel.rich)`.primaryStyle` and `secondaryStyle`.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### 2. Multiple labels with the same text may be displayed by default\r\n\r\n##### Before:\r\n\r\nAlso with the above example, we can see that there are three `05-12 2012` labels, which is confusing. Especially, this should not be the default behavior of labels.\r\n\r\n##### After:\r\n\r\nThere won't be labels with the same date and hour labels will be displayed in the above case.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Custom style is too complex to write with rich text\r\n\r\n#### Before:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"711\" alt=\"屏幕快照 2020-06-29 14 05 07\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/779050/85978591-9c6fbb80-ba11-11ea-8b88-59c3accc58dd.png\">\r\n\r\nTo get the above result, the user has to write the following long code of formatter. Users may not know they could do this, even with clear documentation.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nformatter: function (value) {\r\n    if (value % DAY === 0) {\r\n        var month = echarts.format.formatTime('M月', value)\r\n        var dayOfM = echarts.format.formatTime('d日', value)\r\n        return '{strong|' + dayOfM + '}\\n{lite|' + month + '}';\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n        var formatted = echarts.format.formatTime('h点', value);\r\n        return formatted;\r\n    }\r\n},\r\nrich: {\r\n    strong: {\r\n        color: '#2784e8',\r\n        fontSize: 14,\r\n        fontWeight: 700\r\n    },\r\n    lite: {\r\n        color: '#999',\r\n        lineHeight: 15,\r\n        fontSize: 10\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### After:\r\n\r\nCurrent callback form of formatter will also be available, but we also provide a much simpler way to write if the logic is not so complex.\r\n\r\nWe will support formatters for varied levels like year, month, day, hour, minute and etc., and each of them supports the formatter in either forms of `{hh}:{mm}:{ss}` for simple plain text or `{xxx | {hh}:{mm}:ss}` for rich text, whose style can be configured in [axisLabel.rich](https://echarts.apache.org/option.html#xAxis.axisLabel.rich).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### 4. Cannot use different formatters for different intervals\r\n\r\nConsider the \"2020 Feb\" and \"Feb\" in the following example. The user want to use different formatters (`'YYYY-MMM'` in case A and `'MMM'` in case B.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncase A:\r\n\r\n    |_____________|_____________|_____________|__ ...\r\n  30th         2020 Feb        2nd            3rd\r\n\r\n\r\ncase B:\r\n\r\n    |_____________|_____________|_____________|__ ...\r\n  2020           Feb           Mar           Apr\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Before:\r\n\r\nIt cannot be done.\r\n\r\n##### After:\r\n \r\n`formatter.month` defines formatters when the tick value is a month value (by checking if it's the first day of a month). And it can be in the form of an array of formatters like: `['YYYY-MMM', 'MMM']`. \r\n\r\nThis means, if the label is a first-level (also called primary level) as in case A, where the levels of the labels are day, month, day, day, it uses the first element in the array for the second tick, which is `'YYYY-MMM'` and gets \"2020 Feb\". Similarly, in case B, where the levels of the labels are year, month, month, month, it uses the second element in the array for the second tick and gets \"Feb\".\r\n\r\n\r\n#### 5. Cannot display ticks exactly on the first day of a month or week\r\n\r\n##### Before:\r\n\r\nThere are different days in each month, e.g., 28/29 for Feb and 31 for July. There is no way to make sure the first day is displayed.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"705\" alt=\"屏幕快照 2020-06-29 16 58 19\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/779050/85994290-2c216400-ba2a-11ea-8804-ef1a6b8c962a.png\">\r\n\r\nThis looks a bit arbitrary when choosing the days to be displayed with ticks. And it cannot be changed even with configuration.\r\n\r\n##### After:\r\n\r\nIf the months are different with min and max data (but years are the same), the primary level will be month and we make sure that the first day of each month is displayed with ticks. Note that in this case, the space between each ticks are not the same because days in months are not.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### 6. i18n\r\n\r\n##### Before:\r\n\r\nUsing formatter in the callback form like `echarts.format.formatTime('M月', value)`. It is quite challenging for developers not so familiar with JavaScript.\r\n\r\n##### After:\r\n\r\nWe can provide frequently used time formats like `YYYY` for full year, `MM` for month number and so on. [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/) and can be served as references.\r\n\r\ni18n of the time axis should be considered along with other i18n requirements in ECharts, like toolbox and so on. \r\n\r\nWe are considering embed with English and Chinese language by default with ECharts and other languages can be used as extensions. We are still discuss about the details on this. But the bottom line is, it won't be necessary for developers to implement by using code as low level as `echarts.format.formatTime`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Are there any API changes?\r\n\r\n- [x] The API has been changed.\r\n\r\n#### Before:\r\n\r\n```js\r\naxisLabel: {\r\n    formatter: string | function    // If it's a string, rich text is supported. If it's a function, it can return rich text.\r\n    rich: { ... }  // For label rich text if formatter uses rich text. Default value is null.\r\n},\r\ninterval: number  // The exact interval of ticks\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### After:\r\n\r\n```js\r\naxisLabel: {\r\n    formatter: string | function | object  // If it's an object, it's in the type of LevelFormats\r\n    rich: {  // There are two rich styles defined in ECharts by default, which user may use in formatter\r\n        primary: {\r\n            color: '#000'  // We use a darker color for primary level text\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n},\r\ninterval: number | string[]  // If it's string[], it should be like ['month', 'day'] meaning the tick intervals may be month or day\r\n```\r\n\r\n`LevelFormats` is defined as:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntype LevelFormats = {\r\n    year?: string | string[],\r\n    month?: string | string[],\r\n    day?: string | string[],\r\n    hour?: string | string[],\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `string` can either be a plain text like `'{hh}:{mm}:{ss}'` or a rich text like `strong | '{hh}:{mm}'` and define the rich style `strong` in `formatter`.\r\n\r\nWell... I know this sounds a little complex right now. But it's actually turns easier when you see the real world examples.\r\n\r\n### Example of Usage\r\n\r\n#### 1. Default\r\n\r\nNo `formatter` is required. Label text will display as what we think work for general cases.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Custom primary and secondary styles\r\n\r\n```\r\ncase A:\r\n\r\n    |_____________|_____________|_____________|__ ...\r\n  30th         2020 Feb        2nd            3rd\r\n\r\n\r\ncase B:\r\n\r\n    |_____________|_____________|_____________|__ ...\r\n  2020           Feb           Mar           Apr\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the user wants to use red color for `2020 Feb` in case A and `2020` in case B, this is what required:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nxAxis: {\r\n    // no formatter is required\r\n    rich: {\r\n        primary: {\r\n            color: 'red'\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 3. Display only weeks of year\r\n\r\n```js\r\nxAxis: {\r\n    interval: ['week'],\r\n    axisLabel: {\r\n        formatter: {\r\n            week: 'Week w'\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n<!-- USE ONCE SENTENCE TO DESCRIBE WHAT THIS PR DOES. -->\r\n\r\n#### fix: some refactor about dataZoom and axis scale extent calculation:\r\n\r\n+ The \"scale extent calculation\" is depended by both coord sys and \"dataZoom\".\r\nSo it need to be performed in different stage of workflow and should avoid to call it repleatly or implement it repeatly.\r\nBut previously, the \"scale extent calculation\" is implemented both in `axisHelper.ts` and `dataZoom/AxisProxy.ts`, \r\nwhere different code implements similar logic. \r\n\"Scale extent calculation\" is based on input of:\r\n    (I) option specified min/max/scale (including callback) and \r\n    (II) dataExtent and \r\n    (III) some filter related components like dataZoom.\r\nCurrently we need add more filters depends on that axis scale calculation.\r\ne.g., \r\n    (I) one axis min max effect the other axis extent \r\n    (II) custom filter.\r\nSo we refactor that \"Scale extent calculation\" as a reusable module (see `scaleRawExtentInfo.ts`).\r\n\r\n+ Based on (1), make the callback of axis.min/axis.max consistent whatever it is called in \r\n\"data processing stage\" or \"coord sys updating stage\"\r\n\r\n+ Based on (1), fix some \"inconsistent\" flaw in dataZoom when handling stacked series.\r\n\r\n+ Fix the type of axis.min/max to `ScaleDataValue`. And enable the callback of axis.min/max to return `ScaleDataValue`.\r\n\r\n+ Remove some code that never used.\r\n\r\n+ Make the \"data filter\", which will \"block stream\", not as the default data processor in the register API.\r\n\r\n#### feature: Enable category axis min/max to shrink the other axis extent in cartesian.\r\n\r\nAfter this modification, if some data if out of the range of a category axis, \r\nthe data item will not be filtered, but the extent of the other axis will be calculated\r\nbased on the filtered data.\r\nIf dataZoom is used in either of the xAxis or yAxis in that cartesian, the shrink will not be performed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-19T09:43:46Z","updated_at":"2020-06-22T03:15:26Z","closed_at":"2020-06-20T07:15:49Z","merged_at":"2020-06-20T07:15:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"fca7f98586caca5b1ee966d877cadafa737f94cd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1577024536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTc3MDI0NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/labels/PR:%20awaiting%20review","name":"PR:

feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nBecause of the change about the structure of normal style and emphasis style, original logic about fetching formatter of label has been not suitable. There are some changes to be done.\r\n\r\n**Original way to fetch label formatter:** \r\n_normal_: `label.formatter` (It's okay now)\r\n_emphasis_: `label.emphasis.formatter`(in #10666, a dot is also missing, but even if we add it, it is still not correct for present option structure).\r\n\r\n**Present way to fetch label formatter:** \r\n_normal_: `label.formatter` (same as original way)\r\n_emphasis_: `emphasis.label.formatter` (See [`geo.emphasis.label.formatter`](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#geo.emphasis.label.formatter)).\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n- #10666\r\n- #8612\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\n`geo.label.formatter` is not working.\r\n\r\n### After: How is it fixed in this PR?\r\n\r\nUsing the way suitable for current option structure.\r\n```js\r\nvar formatter = regionModel.get((status === 'normal' ? '' : 'emphasis.') + 'label.formatter');\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26999792/83947681-1f568980-a84b-11ea-8ea6-40c5f9dcf428.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Are there any API changes?\r\n\r\n- [ ] The API has been changed.\r\n\r\n### Related test cases or examples to use the new APIs\r\n\r\nPlease refer to `test/geo-labelFormatter.html`.\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\n### Merging options\r\n\r\n- [x] Please squash the commits into a single one when merge.\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-06T15:17:26Z","updated_at":"2020-06-22T04:23:07Z","closed_at":"2020-06-22T04:20:06Z","merged_at":"2020-06-22T04:20:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"300f75d00b3cbdebf7610d07a97eb0d833464d17","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1577042621,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTc3MDQyNjIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/labels/PR:%20author%20is%20committer","name":"PR:

accepts an array as the parameter to specify symbol rotation at the two ends of the mark line. I think it may be very helpful in some cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Related issues\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/pull/12392#issuecomment-611116024\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nWe can not specify different rotations for symbols at the two endpoints of the mark line.\r\n\r\n### After: How is it fixed in this PR?\r\n\r\nBy specifying an array like `[fromSymbolRotation, toSymbolRotation]` for `markLine.symbolRotate`, we can set different rotations for symbols at the two endpoints of the mark line\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26999792/83522616-83a7df00-a513-11ea-9573-f2848460ac95.png)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Are there any API changes?\r\n\r\n- [x] The API has been changed.\r\n\r\nAdded an option `markLine.symbolRotate`, which accepts a number or an array having two  numeric elements.\r\n\r\n### Related test cases or examples to use the new APIs\r\n\r\nPlease reder to
