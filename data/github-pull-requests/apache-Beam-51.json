the obsolete Avro Gradle plugin by commercehub to the earliest version of davidmc24's Avro plugin and addresses #27231.\r\nIt seems the obsolete artifact versions are being yanked, which caused 0.11.0

[go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver) from 1.11.7 to 1.12.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver/releases\">go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>MongoDB Go Driver 1.12.0</h2>\n<p>The MongoDB Go Driver Team is pleased to release version 1.12.0 of the official Go driver.</p>\n<h2>Release Notes</h2>\n<p>This release adds support for MongoDB 7.0, including production-ready support for <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/queryable-encryption/\">Queryable Encryption</a>. It also adds a new logging interface and configuration API improvements.</p>\n<h3>Production-Ready Queryable Encryption</h3>\n<p>This release introduces backwards breaking changes to the Queryable Encryption protocol. Using Queryable Encryption now requires MongoDB 7.0+ and <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/csfle/reference/libmongocrypt/\">libmongocrypt</a> v1.8.0+.</p>\n<p>It also adds the new <code>ClientEncryption.CreateEncryptedCollection</code> method to automatically create data encryption keys when creating a new encrypted collection and adds the ability to fetch KMS credentials automatically from Azure, GCP, and AWS environments.</p>\n<h3>Logging</h3>\n<p>This release introduces a logging interface to allow users to more easily record detailed information about connection management and command execution within their application.</p>\n<p>The logging configuration adds a new <code>LogSink</code> interface that is compatible with the <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-logr/logr#LogSink\">logr.LogSink</a> interface, allowing users to use existing <code>logr</code> adapters, like <a href=\"https://github.com/go-logr/zerologr\">zerologr</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/go-logr/zapr\">zapr</a>. Users may also implement their own <code>LogSink</code> adapter.</p>\n<p>For example, to integrate logging with an existing <a href=\"https://github.com/rs/zerolog\">zerolog</a> logger:</p>\n<pre lang=\"go\"><code>sink := zerologr.New(&amp;myLogger).GetSink()\nloggerOptions := options.Logger().SetSink(sink)\noptions.Client().SetLoggerOptions(loggerOptions)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Logging can also be enabled using environment variables. For example, to enable command logging at info level to <code>client.log</code>, set:</p>\n<pre><code>export MONGODB_LOG_COMMAND=info\nexport MONGODB_LOG_MAX_DOCUMENT_LENGTH=100\nexport MONGODB_LOG_PATH=&quot;client.log&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Convenient BSON Options</h3>\n<p>The <code>options</code> package has a new way to set various BSON marshaling and unmarshaling behaviors.</p>\n<p>For example, to set BSON options that cause the Go driver to fallback to &quot;json&quot; struct tags if &quot;bson&quot; struct tags are missing, marshal <code>nil</code> Go maps as empty BSON documents, and marshals <code>nil</code> Go slices as empty BSON arrays, use the new <code>options.BSONOptions</code> configuration:</p>\n<pre lang=\"go\"><code>bsonOpts := &amp;options.BSONOptions{\n\tUseJSONStructTags: true,\n\tNilMapAsEmpty:     true,\n\tNilSliceAsEmpty:   true,\n}\noptions.Client().SetBSONOptions(bsonOpts)\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Convenient Write Concerns</h3>\n<p>The <code>writeconcern</code> package has new convenience functions <code>Majority</code>, <code>W1</code>, <code>Journaled</code>, and <code>Unacknowledged</code> for creating common write concerns.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

boilerplate when writing a SchemaTransform. Context in this thread: https://lists.apache.org/thread/69cv98s9fr8qqvvg67wy9ydfmm8v12wd\r\n\r\nThese changes make SchemaTransform an empty abstract class extending `PTransform<PCollectionRowTuple, PCollectionRowTuple>`. This decision was made in part to keep `SchemaTransform` in the codebase instead of reducing the word to just a concept. Another reason of keeping it is for better readability (SchemaTransformProvider provides a SchemaTransform; a SchemaTransform is a transform that works with Row inputs/outputs). \r\nOpen to changes regarding this (ie. if it makes more sense to remove the SchemaTransform class in favor of `PTransform<PCollectionRowTuple, PCollectionRowTuple>`.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the changes are for updating the SchemaTransformProviders in our codebase to reflect this change. The way we go from SchemaTransformProvider to PTransform is simplified, but this does not affect the way it's

is what I've done**\r\n- suggested to rename `dict_of_tuples` to `field_names_and_types`\r\n- added recursive call to `generate_user_type_from_bq_schema` as suggested above\r\n_This change implies that the object `field_names_and_types` passed to `named_fields_to_schema` may already contain a named tuple object instead of plain python types. Therefore:_\r\n- adjusted input to `named_fields_to_schema` to prevent it from parsing all sequence elements which contain already processed elements\r\n- added new parameter to `named_tuple_from_schema` to overwrite certain positions in returned named tuple with already processed elements\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

[github.com/tetratelabs/wazero](https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero) from 1.2.0 to 1.2.1.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/releases\">github.com/tetratelabs/wazero's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.2.1</h2>\n<p>wazero 1.2.1 is an easy upgrade decision for everyone: There is no public API change of any kind, yet updating gives you a more portable and faster wasm runtime.</p>\n<p>This release was helped and motivated by friendly projects in our ecosystem, please star their repos!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/stargazers\">go</a> needs non-blocking I/O for the new <code>GOOS=wasip1</code>, for example, running an HTTP server with middleware, using only one thread.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ncruces/go-sqlite3/stargazers\">go-sqlite3</a> wants smaller and faster machine code to make queries more performant.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/stealthrocket/wasi-go/stargazers\">wasi-go</a> collaborated on a different approach to non-blocking I/O.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As usual, we have a hefty amount of background for you to enjoy, even if you aren't a wazero user, yet. Please <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/stargazers\">star our repo</a> if you like it!</p>\n<h3>Progress in non-blocking I/O</h3>\n<p>WebAssembly does not yet support true parallelism; it lacks support for multiple threads, atomics, and memory barriers. This may be addressed portably in the future, when the <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposals#phase-3---implementation-phase-cg--wg\">threads proposal standardizes</a> and common concerns like garbage collection employ it. For now, the only way to safely use wasm is sequentially, like how <code>GOMAXPROCS=1</code> works in Go.</p>\n<p>This isn't a problem in a lot of cases, but in I/O it can be. Network services often need to accept new connections while processing existing ones. Interleaving of this isn't viable with blocking I/O. The typical way to address this is using non-blocking I/O, with a loop that looks for channels which are ready and processes accordingly.</p>\n<p>As mentioned in the <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/releases/tag/v1.2.0\">1.2.0 release</a>, non-blocking I/O is a work in progress, and it is improved in 1.2.1. This is improved so much that <a href=\"https://github.com/chriso\"><code>@​chriso</code></a> was able to <a href=\"https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/503595\">remove skips</a> for HTTP and file-based non-blocking tests in the emerging <code>GOOS=wasip1</code> in Go 1.21.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/evacchi\"><code>@​evacchi</code></a> focused on the problem of non-blocking I/O, both network sockets and files. He both invented some solutions and leveraged existing approaches from <a href=\"https://github.com/stealthrocket/wasi-go\">wasi-go</a> to fix issues such as inability to use HTTP middleware in Go source compiled to wasm. To make sure it worked, he landed new tests, for example C code compiled with wasi-libc and go(tip) compiled with <code>GOOS=wasip1</code>.</p>\n<p>The changes are all transparent to end users, and while Edo led this effort, <a href=\"https://github.com/achille-roussel\"><code>@​achille-roussel</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/chriso\"><code>@​chriso</code></a> deserve a large thank you for support and the some prior art in <a href=\"https://github.com/stealthrocket/wasi-go\">wasi-go</a>.</p>\n<p>One final note is the battle is not over. We still have work to do in windows and surely there will be more edge cases. Please track <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/1500\">issue 1500</a> and add comments if you noticed any more glitches.</p>\n<h3>Significant execution time savings</h3>\n<p>While developing <a href=\"https://github.com/ncruces/go-sqlite3\">go-sqlite3</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/ncruces\"><code>@​ncruces</code></a> noticed some opportunities both to save size in machine code and performance. This focused on &quot;traps&quot; which are unresolvable execution errors that happen in cases such as divide by zero or invalid bounds conditions. The basic idea was to centralize the concern, so that any instruction that could trap uses the same way out of machine code.</p>\n<p>While developing this, Nuno found a glitch which is fast-pathing these cases can interfere with source code mapping. For example, if you were using a debugger or using a DWARF-enabled trace, the line numbers could be wrong. After discussing with others, a pragmatic way out was chosen: optimize when there is either no debug information (usually the case in release builds) or if <code>RuntimeConfiguration.WithDebugInfoEnabled</code> is set to false. The latter is helpful, because it can be difficult to <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/55781\">prevent a compiler from obfuscating function names</a>, so some may use debug builds always. This is handy in the case of a rare bug such as a nil pointer, because you can still identify original source function by name.</p>\n<p>While led by <a href=\"https://github.com/ncruces\"><code>@​ncruces</code></a>, others were involved in review and design. This was made easier because Nuno kept excellent notes and comments, as well made <a href=\"https://github.com/ncruces/go-sqlite3/tree/main/vfs/tests/speedtest1\">speedtest1</a> to test results. <a href=\"https://github.com/achille-roussel\"><code>@​achille-roussel</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a> contributed feedback and <a href=\"https://github.com/evacchi\"><code>@​evacchi</code></a> ported the implementation over to arm64 a lot easier due to the rigor involved.</p>\n<p>The end results are really quite excellent, especially as debug info is rarely used in release builds. For example, an unrelated project <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kube-scheduler-wasm-extension\">kube-scheduler-wasm-extension</a> performance improved with real data, up to 6.5%, with no other changes except upgrading to the latest patch.</p>\n<h3>Note on TinyGo v0.28.1</h3>\n<p>We updated our TinyGo examples to v0.28.1, which supports more features (such as ReadDir and json), and more idiomatic wasm import signatures. A lot went into this release, so please thank the TinyGo team with a <a href=\"https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/stargazers\">star</a>!</p>\n<pre lang=\"diff\"><code>- //go:wasm-module env\n- //export log\n+ //go:wasmimport env log\nfunc _log(ptr, size uint32)\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/commit/b01ba67fdcf32997d22a0f56b723a71c1c40cd75\"><code>b01ba67</code></a> wasi: add nonblock_test.go from gotip, fix nonblock read on Unix-like (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/1517\">#1517</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/commit/f38587323952b89b57afe24062bb2638c302c886\"><code>f385873</code></a> compiler(arm64): generate trap exit code once (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/1516\">#1516</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/commit/26eae5756c6ad7991f22776a7b7d11000b3e441b\"><code>26eae57</code></a> compiler(amd64): generate exit code once (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/1515\">#1515</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/commit/e3755ce4af832a89e8557a5607bab2ab5df496bc\"><code>e3755ce</code></a> compiler(amd64): avoid unnecessary jump in signed remainder (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/1514\">#1514</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/commit/f3778cae0856d65a41af25fa37eea6cf5e62aa8c\"><code>f3778ca</code></a> wasi: fix nonblocking sockets on *NIX (gotip net/http) (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/1503\">#1503</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/commit/b4d97e5e69998ef56b4ae0ba12ea923cb90431b3\"><code>b4d97e5</code></a> compiler(amd64): emit smaller instructions (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/1513\">#1513</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/commit/1e0f88bc1462ca07a33df83004914d3af7f5bcb4\"><code>1e0f88b</code></a> deps: upgrades to TinyGo v0.28.1 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/1512\">#1512</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/commit/904e9a99723a2252cb596db4127ecdc431aa06f0\"><code>904e9a9</code></a> site: add wasi-go to the list of community projects (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/1511\">#1511</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/commit/7d60e1a7393c256574f58fd36d7eb175c013c0a3\"><code>7d60e1a</code></a> site: add wzprof to the list of community projects (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/1510\">#1510</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/commit/390437e1fe99c852f3ec7d239fda81e027f90428\"><code>390437e</code></a> Revert &quot;wip&quot;</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/compare/v1.2.0...v1.2.1\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=github.com/tetratelabs/wazero&package-manager=go_modules&previous-version=1.2.0&new-version=1.2.1)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

href=\"https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases\">numpy's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.25.0</h2>\n<h1>NumPy 1.25.0 Release Notes</h1>\n<p>The NumPy 1.25.0 release continues the ongoing work to improve the\nhandling and promotion of dtypes, increase the execution speed, and\nclarify the documentation. There has also been work to prepare for the\nfuture NumPy 2.0.0 release, resulting in a large number of new and\nexpired deprecation. Highlights are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for MUSL, there are now MUSL wheels.</li>\n<li>Support the Fujitsu C/C++ compiler.</li>\n<li>Object arrays are now supported in einsum</li>\n<li>Support for inplace matrix multiplication (<code>@=</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will be releasing a NumPy 1.26 when Python 3.12 comes out. That is\nneeded because distutils has been dropped by Python 3.12 and we will be\nswitching to using meson for future builds. The next mainline release\nwill be NumPy 2.0.0. We plan that the 2.0 series will still support\ndownstream projects built against earlier versions of NumPy.</p>\n<p>The Python versions supported in this release are 3.9-3.11.</p>\n<h2>Deprecations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>np.core.MachAr</code> is deprecated. It is private API. In names defined\nin <code>np.core</code> should generally be considered private.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22638\">gh-22638</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>np.finfo(None)</code> is deprecated.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23011\">gh-23011</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>np.round_</code> is deprecated.

decrease Python data sampling overhead from 20% to less than 2%.\r\n\r\nCode was checking whether to sample on a per-element basis. This led to a large performance degradation. Now, a shared reference to a data class is given to each output and a timer. Every so often, the timer wakes up and grabs the most recent sample. The samples are still held in a circular buffer to minimize memory usage risk.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

JobDetails page with topologically sorted transforms, and the input and output pcollection element counts.\r\n* Have the state included in the details page.\r\n* Include basic instructions on using the stand alone prism command.\r\n* Allow the command to run either the management server or the UI as desired. This allows using the UI against any JobManagement endpoint, including a different instance of itself. This allows better iteration on the UI since the state of the JobManagement server doesn't need to restart from scratch each time for checking changes. Probably allows for automatic recompiles in the future.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

in this PR:\r\n\r\n- Fixed a bug that was causing the backend initial ping that was only intended for staging.
