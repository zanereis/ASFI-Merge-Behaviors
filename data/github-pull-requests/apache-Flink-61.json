To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIntroduce aggregating task metrics.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nWe add AggregatedTaskDetailsInfo to JobVertexTaskManagersHandler and JobVertexDetailsHandler\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- JobVertexTaskManagersInfoTest\r\n- JobVertexDetailsInfoTest\r\n- etc.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers:  no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector:  no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes \r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?  docs

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUpdate the flink-connector-files module to AssertJ and JUnit 5 following the [JUnit 5 Migration Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1514Wa_aNB9bJUen4xm5uiuXOooOJTtXqS_Jqk9KJitU/edit)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: ( no )\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRe-enabled e2e test that was failing due a shaded dependency test-jar requiring a transitive shaded test-jar being satisfied by a later unshaded dependency test-jar, changed so that unshaded dependency test-jar is loaded earlier in pom\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* re-enabled previously failing e2e test\r\n* ordered the test-jar dependency `flink-connector-aws-kinesis-streams` to be earlier than `flink-connector-kinesis` and `flink-connector-aws-base` so that the package `software.amazon.awssdk.http.SdkHttpClient` loaded may be recognized by the later shaded package and mapped to `org.apache.flink.kinesis.shaded.software.amazon.awssdk.http.SdkHttpClient`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n1. clone the repository on the master branch and run `mvn clean install -pl :flink-glue-schema-registry-json-test -Prun-end-to-end-tests` - the test fails consistently with exactly the error displayed in the jira\r\n2. apply the fix and run the same command, it passes\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)y\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)n\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)n\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)n\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)n\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)n\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)n\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWe are having the situation where a lot of disk space gets used by both Bash and Java E2E tests. In order to identify which tests aren't properly cleaning up, it would be good if we output the top 15 directories which are the biggest in used disk space\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Output top 15 directories with that are using the most disk space in Bash E2E tests\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n##

in each status\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIntroduce metrics of the duration that a task stays in each status\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- SubtaskExecutionAttemptDetailsInfoTest\r\n- JobVertexDetailsInfoTest\r\n- SubtaskExecutionAttemptDetailsHandlerTest\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIntroduce metrics of the accumulated time that a running task is busy / idle / back-pressured\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests:\r\n- SubtaskExecutionAttemptDetailsInfoTest\r\n- AdaptiveBatchSchedulerTest\r\n- etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector:

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*The current tests in the `SessionManagerTest` are unstable. After reading the logs, I find the created session is immediately removed, which causes the test fails. The reason causes the phenomenon is we don't assign the last access time when we create the session. The timer may check the idleness before users send the request to the Session, which causes the test fails.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Set the last access time in the constructor.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-29T07:20:08Z","updated_at":"2022-07-24T04:54:56Z","closed_at":"2022-07-24T04:54:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6eb9f4460e2dad4c7f87a8f43ceed93df445c0be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20099/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20099/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20099/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/2bee8c34e187541855f87ad20ac85c01057eceb2","head":{"label":"luoyuxia:FLINK-27619","ref":"FLINK-27619","sha":"2bee8c34e187541855f87ad20ac85c01057eceb2","user":{"login":"luoyuxia","id":20389154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzg5MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20389154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":344411200,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDQ0MTEyMDA=","name":"flink","full_name":"luoyuxia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"luoyuxia","id":20389154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzg5MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20389154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request is related to [FLINK-27570](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-27570).\r\n\r\nWhen checkpoints are stored on `CheckpointCoordinator` using the `FileSystemCheckpointStorage`, `initializeBaseLocationsForCheckpoint` may failed to initialize `sharedStateDirectory` and `taskOwnedStateDirectory`.\r\n\r\nHowever, no further  exception handling is done here. Even if the `initializeBaseLocationsForCheckpoint` fails, the job can still be started successfully.\r\n\r\nIn addition, errors will be reported at each subsequent checkpoint: `Failure to finalize checkpoint`.\r\n\r\nFinally, because `FINALIZE_CHECKPOINT_FAILURE` is ignored at `checkFailureCounter` and doesn't participate in the statistics of `tolerableCpFailureNumber`, the checkpoint may fail all the time, but the user cannot perceive it.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nCount `FINALIZE_CHECKPOINT_FAILURE` as a real failure in `CheckpointFailureManager`.\r\n\r\nAbort the checkpoint for operators using union list state through `CHECKPOINT_DECLINED_TASK_CLOSING`, if parts of the subtasks have finished.\r\n\r\nCheck whether the `sharedStateDirectory` and the `taskOwnedStateDirectory` are created successfully for `FileSystemCheckpointStorage` on `CheckpointCoordinator`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - Added test case to verify `FINALIZE_CHECKPOINT_FAILURE` can eventually fails the job.\r\n  - Manually verified the change by use an invalid checkpoint path.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (**no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (**no**)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**no**)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (**yes**)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (**no**)\r\n  - Has specific attention for Checkpointing by @curcur \r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo fix bug in inner join when the filter condition is boolean type. this issue is fixed in master by FLINK-25097, this pr item to fix it on release-1.14.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-28T02:06:08Z","updated_at":"2025-01-15T12:05:56Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ed97712f2e209e3c1213ac81d3e289609a69147f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20086/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20086/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20086/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/cbe1467d2dd5e54d523db7d65d9717227603c8a3","head":{"label":"swuferhong:release-1.14","ref":"release-1.14","sha":"cbe1467d2dd5e54d523db7d65d9717227603c8a3","user":{"login":"swuferhong","id":27358654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzU4NjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27358654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong","html_url":"https://github.com/swuferhong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":373063159,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzMwNjMxNTk=","name":"flink","full_name":"swuferhong/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"swuferhong","id":27358654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzU4NjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27358654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong","html_url":"https://github.com/swuferhong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/swuferhong/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn FLIP-231, [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-231%3A+Introduce+SupportsStatisticReport+to+support+reporting+statistics+from+source+connectors](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/url), we aims to support multi  connectors for reporting statistics. This pr is a part of it to support Hive source. The details are as follows:\r\n\r\n- For `HiveTableSource`, implements `SupportStatisticsReport` interface, and override `reportStatistics()` method.  In this method.\r\n- For Hive source, we support multi formats, including Flink related format, like `ParquetVectorizedInputFormat`, `OrcColumnarRowInputFormat` and Hive related format, like `MapRedInputFormat`, to report stats.\r\n- Adding one UT test `HiveTableSourceStatisticsReportTest` extends `StatisticsReportTestBase` to cover different realize formats.\r\n- Abstract utils for common parts of format statistics report.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- For `HiveTableSource`, implements `SupportStatisticsReport` interface, and override `reportStatistics()` method. \r\n- For Hive source, we support multi formats to report stats.\r\n- Adding UT test.\r\n- Abstract utils for common parts of format statistics report.\r\n- Let `CsvFormatSatisticsReportTest` and `FileSystemStatisticsReportTest` extends from `StatisticsReportTestBase`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Adding UT test `HiveTableSourceStatisticsReportTest` extends `StatisticsReportTestBase` to cover different realize formats.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency):  yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`:  yes\r\n  - The serializers:  no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive):  no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper:  no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?  no

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWith speculative execution, tracking prior executions in an EvictingBoundedList does not work. This is because when using EvictingBoundedList relies on the assumption that the historical executions are added in ascending order of attempt number successively. This is no longer true if speculative execution is enabled. e.g. 3 speculative execution attempts `#1, #2, #3` are running concurrently, later `#3` failed, and then `#1` failed, and execution attempt `#2` keeps running.\r\nThe broken assumption may result in exceptions in REST, job archiving and so on.\r\nThis PR introduces an ExecutionHistory to replace EvictingBoundedList. It hosts the historical executions in a LinkedHashMap with a size bound. When the map grows beyond the size bound, elements are dropped from the head of the map (FIFO order).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Introduced ExecutionHistory to replace EvictingBoundedList*\r\n  - *Reworked the usages*\r\n  - *Reworked the statements of prior executions to historical executions*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - *Added unit tests ExecutionHistoryTest*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix doc of chapter etl.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Add InputSelectable link address ,add  missing `)` at the end of note.\r\n2. Updated the Chinese definition of ` truly Desperate `. In context, I think `迫切渴望` is better than `感到绝望`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)no\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)no \r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)no \r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)no \r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-27T04:01:37Z","updated_at":"2022-07-20T07:35:28Z","closed_at":"2022-07-20T07:35:27Z","merged_at":"2022-07-20T07:35:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"dbe4f473ba92cfb29c53fdf6fbb0026211a849b8","assignee":{"login":"MartijnVisser","id":2989614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODk2MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2989614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser","html_url":"https://github.com/MartijnVisser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"MartijnVisser","id":2989614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODk2MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2989614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser","html_url":"https://github.com/MartijnVisser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20077/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20077/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20077/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/f15b8066ca1d31c0f5db3c18d973f85c2008b893","head":{"label":"nyingping:doc-of-etl","ref":"doc-of-etl","sha":"f15b8066ca1d31c0f5db3c18d973f85c2008b893","user":{"login":"nyingping","id":10743150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzQzMTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10743150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping","html_url":"https://github.com/nyingping","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"6b3ac775fe72514192484f7c923da37ebea5f524","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

pr is based on https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20054.\r\n\r\nIn the first version of speculative execution, an ExecutionTimeBasedSlowTaskDetector will be used to detect slow tasks. For ExecutionTimeBasedSlowTaskDetector, if a task's execution time is much longer than that of most tasks of the same JobVertex, the task will be identified as slow. More specifically, it will compute an execution time baseline for each JobVertex. Tasks which execute longer than or equals to the baseline will be identified as slow tasks.\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nAdd ExecutionTimeBasedSlowTaskDetector for detect slow tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nAdd ExecutionTimeBasedSlowTaskDetector and UT.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nAdd ExecutionTimeBasedSlowTaskDetectorTest that validates the logic of ExecutionTimeBasedSlowTaskDetector.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\nDependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\nThe public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with @public(Evolving):no\r\nThe serializers: no\r\nThe runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\nAnything that affects deployment or recovery:

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nTo fix the exception \"no any field presented in group by\" when over window contains grouping function in Hive dialect like \r\n`SELECT grouping(category), lag(live) over(partition by grouping(category)) FROM t GROUP BY category, live`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - Not to rewrite group function again when it has been rewritten.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAt the moment the new delegation token framework doesn't have Hadoop FS delegation token provider.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Fix the unstable test case.  The root cause is the fetcher thread and another thread is in parallel. There are two cases:*\r\n*1. The fetcher gets the Operation and then another thread closes the Operation. Then the fetcher gets the error message \"Can not fetch results in closed operation.\"*\r\n*2. The closing thread closes the Operation and removes the Operation from the Operation Manager, then the fetcher tries to fetch the results. In this case, the fetcher will get the message \"Can not find the operation\".*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Matches the expected error message in the test.*\r\n  - *In the concurrent test, the thread print the error msg to the terminal when getting exceptions. Introduce an `IgnoreErrorThreadFactory` to swallow the useless message.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nTo fix the `IndexOutOfBoundsException` for window expression  while using Hive dialect\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - Introduce [HiveParserProjectWindowTrimmer.java](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20060/files#diff-09ef2ea6987c9f1680d63436dcb84ffa32dab53724f2e31f2c4ec07525b1a475), and in parse phase, when there exists windowing expression, use it to trim the project node to only keep needed field.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nAdded test in [...connector-hive/src/test/java/org/apache/flink/connectors/hive/HiveDialectQueryITCase.java](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20060/files#diff-fb5fc4106e27e27f9968e59b643003444fd40af58aa2f147ac301009b53a47ca)\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? N/A\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-23T13:17:30Z","updated_at":"2022-08-04T08:41:16Z","closed_at":"2022-08-04T08:41:16Z","merged_at":"2022-08-04T08:41:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"42287b399f7ca74a419cee0385a84e7859fc7628","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20060/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20060/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20060/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/2bb5553afb16ed2d927f6f8cee7388465324caa7","head":{"label":"luoyuxia:FLINK-28212","ref":"FLINK-28212","sha":"2bb5553afb16ed2d927f6f8cee7388465324caa7","user":{"login":"luoyuxia","id":20389154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzg5MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20389154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":344411200,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDQ0MTEyMDA=","name":"flink","full_name":"luoyuxia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"luoyuxia","id":20389154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzg5MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20389154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nIn stream processing, records will be deleted when exceed state ttl (if configured), and when the corresponding record's update arrives again, the operator may not be able to handle it properly, we need a unified error handling mechanism to \r\nhandle this situation, instead of each stateful operator currently handling its own.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n* add 'table.exec.state-stale.error-handling' to ExecutionConfigOptions\r\n* add utility class `ErrorHandlingUtil` for unified state stale error handling\r\n* apply the state stale error handling logic to related stateful streaming operators\r\n* update existing tests to ensure error handling is covered\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nupdated existing tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd support for reading and writing postgres UUID types via Flink SQL STRING type\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- modified AbstractJdbcRowConverter.createInternalConverter to use toString() for CHAR and VARCHAR types instead of casting to string. Previously the cast would fail for postgres UUIDs\r\n- add createExternalConverter override to PostgresRowConverter for CHAR and VARCHAR types. It will check if the string is a UUID and pass the UUID to the PreparedSatement via setObject if so\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSpeculative execution does not support sources/sinks in the first version. Therefore, it will not create speculation instances for vertices which contains source/sink operators.\r\nNote that a job vertex with no input/output does not mean it is a true source/sink vertex:\r\n- Multi-input sources can have input\r\n- It's possible that the vertex with no output edge does not contain any sink operator\r\n- A new sink with topology can spread the sink logic into multiple job vertices connected with job edges.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this pr, we introduce methods to check whether a job vertex contains source/sink operators.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - *Added unit test StreamingJobGraphGeneratorSourceSinkTest*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nPreviously, the job id will be set to zero in application mode when HA is enabled and the job id is not configured by user.\r\nThis commit makes the job id distinct across different jobs in such case, which allows HistoryServer to distinguish it.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nGenerate a random jobId for the application job in HA mode if not configured by user.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as ApplicationDispatcherBootstrapTest.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`:no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, the DefaultScheduler(base of AdaptiveBatchScheduler) can only perform ExecutionVertex level deployment. However, in this case, the scheduler is actually deploying the current execution attempt of the ExecutionVertex.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we need to rework the DefaultScheduler to directly deploy executions.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Introduced ExecutionDeployer which is responsible for deploying executions*\r\n  - *Implemented DefaultExecutionDeployer*\r\n  - *Change DefaultScheduler to use ExecutionDeployer to deploy tasks*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - *Added unit tests DefaultExecutionDeployerTest*\r\n  - *The existing DefaultSchedulerTest and all other IT cases can help to verify the changes*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?
