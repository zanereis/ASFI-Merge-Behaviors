See more verbose description on Jira.\r\n\r\nI searched for all `Class.newInstance()` usages in Beam's codebase and It seems that this was the only one usage of `Class.newInstance()` in beam codebase left. :) Other places that require the new instance use either `Constructor.newInstance()` or `Class.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance()`. Both replacements are acceptable and are not deprecated in Java 9.\r\n\r\n@iemejia could you take a look?\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

fixed the following issues with gen_protos that I encountered while developing:\r\n\r\n- script doesn't print output to shell when run during `python setup.py`\r\n- runs futurize twice when grcpio-tools is not present and needs to be installed\r\n- does not account for the case where there are more output files than .proto files (just keeps triggering out-of-date rebuilds due to timestamp of orphaned output file)\r\n- script runs twice for sdist, because sdist relies on egg_info, and both are wrapped\r\n- would be nice if script printed why it is regenerating pb2 files, since there are a number of possible reasons\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

It also adds links to back to the docs.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

working on https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/9144, I realized there is a gap in BigQueryIO documentation on mapping between data types defined in BigQuery and in Beam SDK.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a user reads a BYTES field from BigQuery into Beam, it will be represented as java.nio.ByteBuffer type in Beam Java SDK. The user will need to do an explicit type cast to ByteBuffer in order to use the data, but there is no easy way the user can know which type they should cast to, unless digging into BigQueryIO's implementation (Java - Avro - BigQuery). So I am adding a table here to make the type conversion clear.\r\n\r\nr: @pabloem \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PyArrow imports to fail on systems other than Windows running Python 2.7.\r\n\r\nAs discussed in apache/beam#9522, PyArrow is not supported on more platforms than we had thought previously. Instead of adding additional special cases, we now allow PyArrow imports to fail on any platform. This is similar to what we already do for e.g. `tensorflow` and `google.cloud.pubsub`.\r\n\r\nR: @tvalentyn \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the Spark runner (Beam 2.14.0 and 2.15.0), a Flatten.pCollections() PTransform is translated into a Spark union operation. This union will create a potentially large number of partitions in the RDD that can overload the driver.\r\n\r\nThis PR does a coalesce operation after the union, which will reduce the number of partitions in the RDD at virtually no cost.\r\n\r\nSee the JIRA ticket for more detail:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8191\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

changes only affects Python mobilegaming varification in `run_rc_validation.sh`:\r\n\r\n- Add timestep to backup file name to make them unique (`~/.bashrc` and `~/.m2/settings.xml`)\r\n- Reorder m2 and bashrc config step. Move them out of python version loop since they are independent to Python version and only need to config once. This can avoid duplicate run which will overwrite backup files.\r\n- Reorder start data injection pipeline. Move it up and outside of python version loop so that all mobile gaming pipelines consume from its output. Originally, the script created one data injector per python version, which is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nManual test from local machine.\r\n\r\n+R: @yifanzou @boyuanzz \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

[BEAM-876] Support schemaUpdateOption in BigQueryIO\r\n\r\nThis adds schemaUpdateOptions to `BigQueryIO.Write` so that one can specify these for BiqQuery when writing in batch mode.\r\n\r\nUsage example:\r\n```\r\nWrite<TableRow> writer = BigQueryIO.writeTableRows()\r\n  .to(\"name-goes-here\")\r\n  .withMethod(BigQueryIO.Write.Method.FILE_LOADS)\r\n  .withWriteDisposition(BigQueryIO.Write.WriteDisposition.WRITE_APPEND)\r\n  .withSchemaUpdateOptions(EnumSet.of(BigQueryIO.Write.SchemaUpdate.Option.ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION));\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Implementation Notes**\r\n\r\n*Hi, hello:*\r\nHi all. I haven't contributed to this code base before, and am not super familiar with it. Style advice and such is super welcome.\r\n\r\n*Load vs Query Jobs in BigQuery:*\r\nBigQuery supports schema update side effects for load and query jobs. This implements support for load jobs only. In the context of Apache Beam, it doesn't seem like there's much utility to supporting queries which write to a table directly (as opposed to reading via a query and writing later in the pipeline). (Open to discussion/correction of course).\r\n\r\n*Avoiding Changing WriteTables Constructor:*\r\nI've added this to `WriteTables` with a `withSchemaUpdateOptions` method so as not to perturb the public constructor with an optional parameter. There's some awkwardness there -- but it seemed preferable to breaking the api or adding a secondary constructor.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

current implementation of `HllCount.Init` and `HllCount.MergePartial` returns an empty `PCollection` when its input is empty. This is not ideal because, for example, if they are followed by a `HllCount.Extract` then the output `PCollection` will also be empty, but the result we really want is a `PCollection` of a single value `0`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR is changing the behavior of empty aggregation such that it returns an \"empty sketch\" (represented by an empty `byte[]` of length 0), and also `HllCount.Extract` to handle it.\r\n\r\nThe reason why we don't use `null` to represent \"empty sketch\" is, in short:\r\n1) Space-efficiency: We will have to override the default `ByteArrayCoder`, and use a `NullableCoder` of `ByteArrayCoder` to encode the output, which is less efficient in terms of space because it needs to encode the information of whether the element is `null`\r\n2) Safety: `null` values may cause problem in downstream transforms\r\n\r\nr: @zfraa @boyuanzz \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

inherits from two classes `WithTypeHints`, `HasDisplayData`, both of which are intended to be mixins. Mixins typically cannot be used on their own and don't have a constructor. `WithTypeHints` does have a constructor, which may  create an impression that it is more than a mixin, however this constructor is not required since the only initialized field will also be lazily initialized in `_get_or_create_type_hints`.\r\n\r\n`WithTypeHints.__init__()` also doesn't call `super(WithTypeHints, self).__init__()`, which means that `super(PTransform, self).__init__()` invocation  stops at `WithTypeHints`, and doesn't proceed to other classes in `PTransform.__mro__`. The behavior and expectations in super/subclasses of PTransform would be more consistent if all of them follow the same contract of not calling `super()`. \r\n\r\nRemoving `__init__` call in `PTransform` may be a clear signal that subclasses of PTransform are also not required to call constructor of PTransform. Such calls are not (usually not?) necessary, however this may not be evident, and prompt users of PTransform to create additional boilerplate, such as: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/tfrecordio.py#L217 .\r\n\r\nSubclassess of PTransform in Beam codebase do not always call constructor of PTransform, for example: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/393396b7ea4e896ef179758f9a4c0675f7cb8ff0/sdks/python/apache_beam/transforms/core.py#L1912, https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/483b9fbcae0dca3a492284169b64f7cea8d4c025/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/bigquery_file_loads.py#L550 don't call `super()`, which adds confusion whether this is necessary, so we may want to clean up calls to `PTransform.__init__()` in a future change.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
