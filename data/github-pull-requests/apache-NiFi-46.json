Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8764 Refactors `UnpackContent` to use Apache Commons Compress for reading standard Zip files and Zip4j for reading encrypted Zip files.  The presence of a value in the `Password` property results in using Zip4j, otherwise Apache Commons Compress will be used.  This approach provides greater compatibility for compression algorithms supported in Apache Commons Compress that are not supported in Zip4j, while also maintaining support for decryption of password-protected Zip files as implemented for NIFI-7777.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8741 Updates `JettyServerGroovyTest` to use `NetworkUtils.getAvailableTcpPort()` instead of 8443.  This change avoids potential unit test failures when some other service is listening on port 8443.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8748 Corrects `PutKudu` Date field parsing when converting from a `String` Record field value to a `java.sql.Date` for a Kudu `PartialRow`.\r\n\r\nThe `DataTypeUtils.getDateFormat()` method sets a default time zone of `GMT` on the `SimpleDateFormat` used for parsing, which results in subtracting one day from the input date string.  Changing the approach to use a `SimpleDateFormat` with the default system time zone avoids the implicit date conversion and preserves the original date value following the conversion to `java.sql.Date`.  The time zone setting is not necessary since the date field does not include precision beyond a day boundary.\r\n\r\nChanges include a new unit test method to verify the corrected behavior.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-29T16:32:01Z","updated_at":"2021-06-30T11:41:15Z","closed_at":"2021-06-30T11:40:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7d0b39d3de78d1f5708bfe40570b6efb0f62954d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5194/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5194/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5194/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/e21d6b02ad519fc0346174c59330c3b36b116192","head":{"label":"exceptionfactory:NIFI-8748","ref":"NIFI-8748","sha":"e21d6b02ad519fc0346174c59330c3b36b116192","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":297800463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc4MDA0NjM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"exceptionfactory/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory/nifi","description":"Apache

This facilitates easier configuration during flow creation especially with multi-tenancy in mind. There are 3 properties added: default flowfile expiration, default back pressure object threshold, default back pressure data size threshold.\r\n\r\nSee updated User Guide for additional information.\r\n\r\nThe new behavior includes a basic unit test. It was also tested extensively in a running NiFi as some features are heavily UI-dependent.\r\nVerified the new elements of the Process Group (PG) DTO are populated into flow.xml.gz when NiFi is started using an older format, i.e. without the new elements included; no warnings are issued to nifi-app.log\r\nVerified export/import of process groups maintains property settings when using templates, NiFi Registry and JSON flow definition\r\nVerified the default values of the added elements are “0 sec” for FlowFile Expiration, and obtained from nifi.properties for back pressure settings\r\nVerified PG settings are displayed as non-editable when user is not in the ‘modify the component’ policy.\r\nVerified PG settings are displayed as “Unauthorized” when user is not in the ‘view the component’ policy.\r\nVerified new connection defaults change as the PG settings change\r\nVerified the settings of existing connections do not change as the PG settings change\r\nVerified newly created PG inherits strings from parent\r\nVerified settings of existing child PG do not change as parent PG settings change\r\nVerified User Guide documentation updated and displays correctly\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

is a small proposal for extending the HDFS based NAR autoloading feature with a convenience feature: the addition makes it possible to use the same core-site.xml for multiple providers but overwriting the endpoint for every and each actual provider.

update, it ends up in a state of STARTING. If the parameter is then updated again, it transitions the state to STOPPING but the processor is not fully stopped yet. At that point, the parameter is updated and the processor is attempted to be started again. Fixed this by keeping the number of active threads to >= 1 if processor is STOPPING in order to convey that it is not fully stopped. Also addressed a few minor bugs discovered in the process: when stopping a processor, if status == invalid, it should be skipped instead of waiting for the status to become stopped since it never will be. In the DTO's run status use Stopped instead of Invalid if there is at least 1 active thread / if stopping but not stopped. When considering if a processor has transitioned to the desired state for parameter updates, do not consider validation status if still transitioning to stopped or if the desired state has already been reached. Added new system tests to verify behavior.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\r\n  contributor license agreements.

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8630 Upgrades `javax.mail` 1.4.7 to `jakarta.mail` 2.0.1 to support modern TLS protocol versions in the `PutEmail` processor.\r\n\r\nOlder versions of javax.mail do not support TLSv1.2, causing `SSLHandshakeException` errors in `PutEmail` when running on Java versions that have disabled TLSv1 and TLSv1.1.  The `jakarta.mail` library is the maintained and repackaged version of the `javax.mail` library, which supports current TLS protocol versions matching JDK enabled protocols.  Upgrading to Jakarta Mail also required including the updated Jarkata Activation library.\r\n\r\nAdditional updates include a display name of `SMTP STARTTLS` for the `SMTP TLS` property, indicating that it is used to enable Opportunistic TLS over SMTP.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [X] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [X] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [X] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

issue is https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-8727 \r\nThe sub issue is https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-8728\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n  //originalFlowFile has content , so ClaimantCount=1\r\n  FlowFile multiFlowFile = session.clone(originalFlowFile); // claim count +1，so ClaimantCount=2\r\n  multiFlowFile = session.write(multiFlowFile, new OutputStreamCallback() {\r\n                  @Override\r\n                  public void process(OutputStream out) throws IOException {\r\n                      IOUtils.write(tvMultiAlbumJson, out, Charset.forName(\"UTF-8\"));\r\n                  }\r\n  });//the new content will resuse the same resource claim , so ClaimantCount=3\r\n  //At this point we have two flowfile and two contentClaim ，and ClaimCount=3.\r\n  //When this two flowfiles dropped，the claimantCount should decrement to 0，however the result is ClaimantCount=1！\r\n  //If we use \"sh nifi.sh diagnostics --verbose dump.log\" to get a dump log，we will find some info like this “default/465/1623853427574-10705, Claimant Count = 1, In Use = true, Awaiting Destruction = false, References (0) = []” \r\n  //And the file “default/465/1623853427574-10705” will never be archived，and will never be destroyed，and the content_repository will use more storage than it configs.\r\n\r\nThe above is a sort of phenomenon. The reason is the code below：\r\n\r\n    //session.clone\r\n    public FlowFile clone(FlowFile example, final long offset, final long size) {\r\n        .....................................\r\n        final StandardRepositoryRecord record = new StandardRepositoryRecord(null);    //here the originalFlowFileRecord of record is null\r\n        .....................................\r\n        return clone;\r\n    }\r\n    //session.commit\r\n    private void updateClaimCounts(final RepositoryRecord record) {\r\n        ..........................................................\r\n        if (record.isContentModified()) {\r\n            decrementClaimCount(originalClaim);  //here the originalClaim is null\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should not use session.clone like that，but without official note it will sometimes happen to be used.\r\nSo i change \"final StandardRepositoryRecord record = new StandardRepositoryRecord(null)\" to \"final StandardRepositoryRecord record = new StandardRepositoryRecord(null, currRec);\"\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen I found the issue “claimantCount will never decrement to zero”，I restart the nifi instance and a new issue happened；\r\n\r\nHere is the log：\r\n\r\n2021-06-23 10:33:02,788 INFO [main] o.a.n.c.repository.FileSystemRepository Found unknown file

This affects (at least) PostgreSQL's UUID type as its SQL type is OTHER which the driver/DB cannot determine `IS NULL` for.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8711 Adds support for `keyboard-interactive` authentication in SFTP processors configured with a password.\r\n\r\nThe implementation uses the configured password to attempt both `password` and `keyboard-interactive` authentication during the SSH client connection.  This approach restores the implicit behavior supported through JSch prior to the SSHJ migration in #3726.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include moving Authentication Method configuration to separate methods with additional debug logging.\r\n\r\nThese changes can be tested at runtime against an OpenSSH server configured with the following settings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPasswordAuthentication no\r\nChallengeResponseAuthentication yes\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-7468 Resolves several issues with `SSLSocketChannel` handshake processing in order to work with TLS 1.3.\r\n\r\n`SSLSocketChannel` includes custom handling of `javax.net.ssl.SSLEngine`, which did not respond properly to Post-Handshake Messages in TLS 1.3, described in RFC 8446 Section 4.6.  The `SSLSocketChannel.connect()` method was clearing stream and application buffers after completing the TLS handshake, resulting in the loss of Post-Handshake messages as well as network packets.  This loss of data resulted in exceptions such `Tag mismatch` under both TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 when using AES-GCM cipher suites.\r\n\r\nThe `SSLSocketChannelSender.close()` method was also closing the connected `SocketChannel`, resulting in `SSLSocketChannel` being unable to process TLS close notify messages.\r\n\r\nNIFI-7468 introduces a private `ChannelStatus` enum and convenience logging methods to support detailed logging at the `TRACE` level when necessary.  Logs and exception messages now include both the remote address and remote port number to improve troubleshooting options.\r\n\r\nThe new `SSLSocketChannelTest` leverages a TLS server and client using the Netty framework to verify expected behavior for both TLS 1.2 and 1.3.  Unit testing and runtime testing of TLS 1.3 requires either Java 11, or a version of Java 8 with update 272 or higher.\r\n\r\nThese changes address issues with several processors, including as `ListenTCP` and `PutTCP`, as well as Distributed Cache Clients running with TLS.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8672 Updates `NettyEventSender` and `NettyEventServer` used in `ListenSyslog` and unit tests to call `syncUninterruptibly()` following `Channel.close()` and `EventLoopGroup.shutdownGracefully()` methods.  This ensures that the operations complete before the method returns, which should also make `TestListenSyslog` more reliable by closing socket connections prior to polling for success FlowFiles.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

All configuration for future SensitivePropertiesProviders (SPPs) is intended to go into bootstrap.conf.\r\n* The single StandardSensitivePropertyProviderFactory implementation is intended to select the appropriate SPP based on a new SensitivePropertyProtectionScheme enum.\r\n* Each SPP implementation can choose to use the master key and/or the BootstrapProperties provided in the SPP Factory\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Also replaced the inefficient stream() commands in the normalize() methods to for-loops for a performance boost.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8654 Updates the SNMP `TestAgent` to use `NetworkUtils.getAvailableUdpPort()` instead of `NetworkUtils.availablePort()` in order to find an available UDP port instead of TCP.  The TestAgent address also includes the explicit `udp` prefix in the address instead of relying on the default behavior of `GenericAddress.parse()` to select UDP.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

IN PROGRESS\r\n\r\nCreated new component: FlowAnalyisRule.\r\nAdded new framework functionality: analyze flow.\r\n\r\nFlowAnalysisRules can be managed from the UI: hamburger-menu -> Controller Settings -> Flow Analysis Rules\r\n\r\nFlow analysis is run by the framework:\r\n-For the whole flow, scheduled every 5 seconds (similar to validation)\r\n-For each components individually, during their validation\r\n-For components within a process group (can be root), when requested through REST interface (not from UI as of yet)\r\n\r\nFlow analysis may produce rule violations as a result. These are stored in memory and are not persisted.\r\nThey\r\n-Can be requested through REST interface (not from UI as of yet)\r\n-In case of POLICY rules, invalidate the corresponding components\r\n\r\nCurrently FlowAnalysisRule implementations are directly provided processor and controller service instances for analysis (as VersionedProcessors and VersionedControllerServices).\r\nIndirectly they can analyze other components accessible from the directly provided components.\r\n\r\nAdded one FlowAnalyisRule implementation: DisallowProcessorType.\r\nIt can be configured with the (simple) name of a processor type.\r\nProduces a rule violation for each processor instance of that type.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\r\n  contributor license agreements.

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8511 Adds an encrypted repository KeyProvider implementation using a `java.security.KeyStore` instance containing `javax.crypto.SecretKey` entries.  The implementation supports PKCS12 or BCFKS keystores.\r\n\r\nThe Bouncy Castle implementation of PKCS12 does not support SecretKey entries, so `KeyStoreUtils` includes additional mappings and methods for reading keystore files containing SecretKey entries.  Changes also include refactoring the `KeyProvider` interface and implementations into a separate `nifi-security-kms` module to streamline and clarify dependencies.  The User Guide includes additional sections with example `nifi.properties` sections to configure the `KeyStoreKeyProvider`.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is
