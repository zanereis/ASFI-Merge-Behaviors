So, the actual stack size should be 224KB rather than 32KB for Java 8 on x86_64/Linux.\r\nAs the test passes for Java 8 but doesn't for Java 11, 224KB is enough while 136KB is not.\r\nSo I think specifing 256KB is reasonable for the new stack size.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nProvide error handling when creating kubernetes volumes. Right now they keys are expected to be there and if not it fails with a `key not found` error, but not knowing why do you need that `key`.\r\n\r\nAlso I renamed some tests that didn't indicate the kind of kubernetes volume\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nEasier for the users to understand why `spark-submit` command is failing if not providing they right kubernetes volumes properties.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nIt was tested with the current tests plus added one more.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Jira

patch is a small extension to change-request SPARK-28133, which added inverse hyperbolic functions to the SQL interpreter, but did not include those methods within the Scala `sql.functions._` API. This patch makes `acosh`, `asinh` and `atanh` functions available through the Scala API.\r\n\r\nUnit-tests have been added to `sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/MathFunctionsSuite.scala`. Manual testing has been done via `spark-shell`, using the following recipe:\r\n```\r\nval df = spark.range(0, 11)\r\n              .toDF(\"x\")\r\n              .withColumn(\"x\", ($\"x\" - 5) / 2.0)\r\nval hyps = df.withColumn(\"tanh\", tanh($\"x\"))\r\n             .withColumn(\"sinh\", sinh($\"x\"))\r\n             .withColumn(\"cosh\", cosh($\"x\"))\r\nval invhyps = hyps.withColumn(\"atanh\", atanh($\"tanh\"))\r\n                  .withColumn(\"asinh\", asinh($\"sinh\"))\r\n                  .withColumn(\"acosh\", acosh($\"cosh\"))\r\ninvhyps.show\r\n```\r\nwhich

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs of today,\r\n- SPARK-30034 Apache Spark 3.0.0 switched its default Hive execution engine from Hive 1.2 to Hive 2.3. This removes the direct dependency to the forked Hive 1.2.1 in maven repository.\r\n- SPARK-32981 Apache Spark 3.1.0(`master` branch) removed Hive 1.2 related artifacts from Apache Spark binary distributions.\r\n\r\nThis PR(SPARK-20202) aims to remove the following usage of unofficial Apache Hive fork completely from Apache Spark master for Apache Spark 3.1.0.\r\n```\r\n<hive.group>org.spark-project.hive</hive.group>\r\n<hive.version>1.2.1.spark2</hive.version>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the forked Hive 1.2.1.spark2 users, Apache Spark 2.4(LTS) and 3.0 (~ 2021.12) will provide it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- First, Apache Spark community should not use the unofficial forked release of another Apache project.\r\n- Second, Apache Hive 1.2.1 was released at 2015-06-26 and the forked Hive `1.2.1.spark2` exposed many unfixable bugs in Apache because the forked `1.2.1.spark2` is not maintained at all. Apache Hive 2.3.0 was released at 2017-07-19 and it has been used with less number of bugs compared with `1.2.1.spark2`. Many bugs still exist in `hive-1.2` profile and new Apache Spark unit tests are added with `HiveUtils.isHive23` condition so far.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is a dev-only change. PRBuilder will not accept `[test-hive1.2]` on master and `branch-3.1`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. SBT/Hadoop 3.2/Hive 2.3 (https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/129366)\r\n2. SBT/Hadoop 2.7/Hive 2.3 (https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/129382)\r\n3. SBT/Hadoop 3.2/Hive 1.2 (This has not been supported already due to Hive 1.2 doesn't work with Hadoop 3.2.)\r\n4. SBT/Hadoop 2.7/Hive 1.2 (https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/129383, This is rejected)","created_at":"2020-10-02T15:37:59Z","updated_at":"2020-10-06T00:44:15Z","closed_at":"2020-10-05T22:30:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"785ae3626ca0230a74fe06f24ada4daac6950eac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29936/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29936/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29936/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c855260761af80b287caaea0ab071dbd15319265","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-REMOVE-HIVE1","ref":"SPARK-REMOVE-HIVE1","sha":"c855260761af80b287caaea0ab071dbd15319265","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"82721ce00b6cf535abd3d9cd66445e452554d15d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAt SPARK-32493, the R installation was switched to manual installation because setup-r was broken. This seems fixed in the upstream so we should better switch it back.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo avoid maintaining the installation steps by ourselve.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions build in this PR should test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes `SparkBuild.scala` to recognize build settings for Scala 2.13.\r\nIn `SparkBuild.scala`, a variable `scalaBinaryVersion` is hardcoded as `2.12`.\r\nSo, an environment variable `SPARK_SCALA_VERSION` is also to be `2.12`.\r\nThis issue causes some test suites (e.g. `SparkSubmitSuite`) to be error.\r\n\r\n```\r\n===== TEST OUTPUT FOR o.a.s.deploy.SparkSubmitSuite: 'user classpath first in driver' =====\r\n\r\n20/10/02 08:55:30.234 redirect stderr for command /home/kou/work/oss/spark-scala-2.13/bin/spark-submit INFO Utils: Error: Could not find or load m\r\nain class org.apache.spark.launcher.Main\r\n20/10/02 08:55:30.235 redirect stderr for command /home/kou/work/oss/spark-scala-2.13/bin/spark-submit INFO Utils: /home/kou/work/oss/spark-scala-\r\n2.13/bin/spark-class: line 96: CMD: bad array subscript\r\n```\r\nThe reason of this error is that environment variables `SPARK_JARS_DIR` and `LAUNCH_CLASSPATH` is defined in `bin/spark-class` as follows.\r\n```\r\nSPARK_JARS_DIR=\"${SPARK_HOME}/assembly/target/scala-$SPARK_SCALA_VERSION/jars\"\r\nLAUNCH_CLASSPATH=\"${SPARK_HOME}/launcher/target/scala-$SPARK_SCALA_VERSION/classes:$LAUNCH_CLASSPATH\"\r\n```\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo build for Scala 2.13 successfully.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRowMatrix contains a computation based on spark.driver.maxResultSize. However, when this value is set to 0, the computation fails (log of 0). The fix is simply to correctly handle this setting, which means unlimited result size, by using a tree depth of 1 in the RowMatrix method.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSimple bug fix

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, a pod remains \"running\" as long as there is at least one running container. This prevents Spark from noticing when a container has failed in an executor pod with multiple containers. With this change, user can configure the behavior to be different. Namely, if any container in the executor pod has failed, either the executor process or one of its sidecars, the pod is considered to be failed, and it will be rescheduled.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, new spark property added.\r\nUser is now able to choose whether to turn on this feature using the `spark.kubernetes.executor.checkAllContainers` property.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit test was added and all passed.\r\nI tried to run integration test by following the instruction [here](https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html) (section \"Testing K8S\") and also [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/resource-managers/kubernetes/integration-tests/README.md), but I wasn't able to run it smoothly as it fails to talk with minikube cluster.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes the description how to build Spark for Scala 2.13 with sbt.\r\nIn the current doc, how to build Spark for Scala 2.13 with sbt is described like:\r\n![scala-2 13-build-before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/94816248-80c3e900-0436-11eb-9bc2-99af5786971a.png)\r\n\r\nBut build fails with this command because scala-2.13 profile is not enabled and scala-parallel-collections is absent.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[error] /home/kou/work/oss/spark-scala-2.13/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/UnionRDD.scala:23: object parallel is not a member of package collection\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe correct command should be:\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt -Pspark-2.13 compile\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe build command is wrong.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI checked that `sbt -Pspark-2.13` is correct with the following command:\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt -Dscala.version=2.13.3 -Phive -Phive-thriftserver -Pyarn -Pkubernetes  compile\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also build the modified doc and checked the generated html:\r\n![spark-scala-2

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark has a hardcode list to contain known shuffle managers, which has two values now. It does not contain user's custom shuffle manager which is set through Spark config \"spark.shuffle.manager\".\r\n\r\nWe hit issue when set \"spark.shuffle.manager\" with our own shuffle manager plugin (Uber Remote Shuffle Service implementation, https://github.com/uber/RemoteShuffleService). Other users will hit same issue when they implement their own shuffle manager.\r\n\r\nIt is better to remove that knownManagers hardcode list, to support user's custom shuffle manager implementation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark has shuffle manager API to support custom shuffle manager implementation. The hardcoded known managers list does not consider that shuffle manager config value which could be set by user. Thus better to remove this hardcoded known managers list.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCurrent Spark unit test already covers the code

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a backport PR for branch-3.0. This change was raised to `master` branch in `https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29872`\r\n\r\nWhen `peakMemoryMetrics` in `ExecutorSummary` is `Option.empty`, then the `ExecutorMetricsJsonSerializer#serialize` method does not execute the `jsonGenerator.writeObject` method. This causes the json to be generated with `peakMemoryMetrics` key added to the serialized string, but no corresponding value. \r\nThis causes an error to be thrown when it is the next key `attributes` turn to be added to the json:\r\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonGenerationException: Can not write a field name, expecting a value\r\n`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAt the start of the Spark job, if `peakMemoryMetrics` is `Option.empty`, then it causes \r\na `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonGenerationException` to be thrown when we navigate to the Executors tab in Spark UI.\r\nComplete stacktrace:\r\n\r\n> com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonGenerationException: Can not write a field name, expecting a value\r\n> \tat

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Override the default SQL strings in the Oracle Dialect for:\r\n    - ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN\r\n    - ALTER TABLE UPDATE COLUMN TYPE\r\n    - ALTER TABLE UPDATE COLUMN NULLABILITY\r\n2. Add new docker integration test suite `jdbc/v2/OracleIntegrationSuite.scala`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn SPARK-24907, we implemented JDBC v2 Table Catalog but it doesn't support some `ALTER TABLE` at the moment. This PR supports Oracle specific `ALTER TABLE`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new integration test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ ./build/sbt -Pdocker-integration-tests \"test-only *.OracleIntegrationSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2020-09-30T12:36:00Z","updated_at":"2020-12-11T20:28:20Z","closed_at":"2020-10-07T04:49:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e4767359751e6f5cfabb1a1b8e1d30d188825baf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29912/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29912/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29912/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5be3a7d432cfc5083d4014811a8676bd156c66d9","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:jdbcv2-oracle-alter-table","ref":"jdbcv2-oracle-alter-table","sha":"5be3a7d432cfc5083d4014811a8676bd156c66d9","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

Let's say we have a rule to simply assign new `ExprId`s in a projection list like this;\r\n```\r\ncase class TestRule extends Rule[LogicalPlan] {\r\n  override def apply(plan: LogicalPlan): LogicalPlan = plan.transformUpWithNewOutput {\r\n    case p @ Project(projList, _) =>\r\n      val newPlan = p.copy(projectList = projList.map { _.transform {\r\n        // Assigns a new `ExprId` for references\r\n        case a: AttributeReference => Alias(a, a.name)()\r\n      }}.asInstanceOf[Seq[NamedExpression]])\r\n\r\n      val attrMapping = p.output.zip(newPlan.output)\r\n      newPlan -> attrMapping\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen, this rule is applied into a plan below;\r\n```\r\n(3) Project [a#5, b#6]\r\n+- (2) Project [a#5, b#6]\r\n   +- (1) Project [a#5, b#6]\r\n      +- LocalRelation <empty>, [a#5, b#6]\r\n```\r\nIn the first transformation, the rule assigns new `ExprId`s in `(1) Project` (e.g., a#5 AS a#7, b#6 AS b#8). In the second transformation, the rule corrects the input references of `(2) Project`  first by using attribute mapping given from `(1) Project` (a#5->a#7 and b#6->b#8) and then assigns new `ExprId`s (e.g., a#7 AS a#9, b#8 AS b#10). But, in the third transformation, the rule fails because it tries to correct the references of `(3) Project` by using incorrect attribute mapping (a#7->a#9 and b#8->b#10) even though the correct one is a#5->a#9 and b#6->b#10. To fix this issue, this PR modified the code to update the attribute mapping entries that are obsoleted by generated entries in a given rule.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

of #29785 to Spark 2.4\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `UnsafeExternalSorter` to no longer allocate any memory while spilling. In particular it removes the allocation of a new pointer array in `UnsafeInMemorySorter`. Instead the new pointer array is allocated whenever the next record is inserted into the sorter.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this change the `UnsafeExternalSorter` could throw an OOM while spilling. The following sequence of events would have triggered an OOM:\r\n\r\n1. `UnsafeExternalSorter` runs out of space in its pointer array and attempts to allocate a new large array to replace the old one.\r\n2. `TaskMemoryManager` tries to allocate the memory backing the new large array using `MemoryManager`, but `MemoryManager` is only willing to return most but not all of the memory requested.\r\n3. `TaskMemoryManager` asks `UnsafeExternalSorter` to spill, which causes `UnsafeExternalSorter` to spill the current run to disk, to free its record pages and to reset its `UnsafeInMemorySorter`.\r\n4. `UnsafeInMemorySorter` frees the old pointer array, and tries to allocate a new small pointer array.\r\n5. `TaskMemoryManager` tries to allocate the memory backing the small array using `MemoryManager`, but `MemoryManager` is unwilling to give it any memory, as the `TaskMemoryManager` is still holding on to the memory it got for the new large array.\r\n6. `TaskMemoryManager` again asks `UnsafeExternalSorter` to spill, but this time there is nothing to spill.\r\n7. `UnsafeInMemorySorter` receives less memory than it requested, and causes a `SparkOutOfMemoryError` to be thrown, which causes the current task to fail.\r\n\r\nWith the changes in the PR the following will happen instead:\r\n\r\n1. `UnsafeExternalSorter` runs out of space in its pointer array and attempts to allocate a new large array to replace the old one.\r\n2. `TaskMemoryManager` tries to allocate the memory backing the new large array using `MemoryManager`, but `MemoryManager` is only willing to return most but not all of the memory requested.\r\n3. `TaskMemoryManager` asks `UnsafeExternalSorter` to spill, which causes `UnsafeExternalSorter` to spill the current run to disk, to free its record pages and to reset its `UnsafeInMemorySorter`.\r\n4. `UnsafeInMemorySorter` frees the old pointer array.\r\n5. `TaskMemoryManager` returns control to `UnsafeExternalSorter.growPointerArrayIfNecessary` (either by returning the the new large array or by throwing a `SparkOutOfMemoryError`).\r\n6. `UnsafeExternalSorter` either frees the new large array or it ignores the `SparkOutOfMemoryError` depending on what happened in the previous step.\r\n7. `UnsafeExternalSorter` successfully allocates a new small pointer array and operation continues as normal.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTests were added in `UnsafeExternalSorterSuite` and `UnsafeInMemorySorterSuite`.","created_at":"2020-09-30T11:24:24Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T07:59:16Z","closed_at":"2020-10-08T07:59:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f4d17440ce15c8d3165f20cf2b424540e80e1db6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29910/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29910/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29910/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e431fb8edd16f9d112c7a6ead44e6e871db1e17f","head":{"label":"tomvanbussel:backport-SPARK-32901","ref":"backport-SPARK-32901","sha":"e431fb8edd16f9d112c7a6ead44e6e871db1e17f","user":{"login":"tomvanbussel","id":46442880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDQyODgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46442880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel","html_url":"https://github.com/tomvanbussel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":174318680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzQzMTg2ODA=","name":"spark","full_name":"tomvanbussel/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tomvanbussel","id":46442880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDQyODgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46442880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel","html_url":"https://github.com/tomvanbussel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tomvanbussel/spark","description":"Apache

By now, spark UI only displays final aggregation results, much information is hidden by this way. If spark UI could provide time series data view, it would be more helpful to performance debugging problems. We would like to build application statistics page in history server based on task metrics to provide more straight forward insight for spark application.\r\nBelow are views in application statistics page:\r\n**Execution Throughput**: sum of completed tasks, stages, and jobs per minute. (associated stage Ids can be viewed in tool tip message.)\r\n![cluster throughput](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10524738/94762037-77b21980-035b-11eb-8cd1-22a56a5a88c7.JPG)\r\n\r\n**IO (Shuffle and Read) Data**: sum of total shuffle read bytes, shuffle write bytes and read bytes per minute.\r\n![IOData](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10524738/94659699-8a741200-02b9-11eb-80e6-9271828fc3b1.JPG)\r\n\r\n**Task Duration Time**: application level 50% and 90% percentile of task duration per minute.\r\n![taskduration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10524738/94659768-a37cc300-02b9-11eb-8147-c6ff1c2dfc1f.JPG)\r\n\r\n**Task Duration Time Component %**: percentage of scheduler delay, computing time, shuffle read, task deserialization, result serialization, shuffle write, get result time by task duration per minute.\r\n![taskdurationpercentile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10524738/94659888-cd35ea00-02b9-11eb-8c82-5ddf26a7c9ff.JPG)\r\n\r\n**Task JVM GC Time %**: percentage of task JVM GC time by task duration per minute.\r\n![taskgcpercentile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10524738/94659984-f48cb700-02b9-11eb-819a-d35f3529f68c.JPG)\r\n\r\nApplication statistics page is only available in spark history server. Aggregated data is generated when parsing event log file and store in KVStore. Metrics data is aggregated to one data instance per minute (based on task finish time). For example, if task a finish time is in (t1 - 1minute, t1],a's data is added to data instance t1. This follows same approach of executors metrics.\r\nFrom my test there is no much increasing for kv store size and replaying time. Here is my local test result. Impact to replay time may be little different for different applications, but it should be too big.\r\n![data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10524738/94762386-5ef63380-035c-11eb-800a-c4cf0c69caa6.JPG)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nUser facing change compared to master: Add application statistics page under jobs tab and new page link in jobs page.\r\nEntry point:\r\n![entrypoint](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10524738/94660218-40d7f700-02ba-11eb-878e-c02de9e11a9d.JPG)\r\n\r\nApplication statistics page:\r\n![screencapture-localhost-19090-history-application-1598927142852-0002-1-jobs-statistics-2020-09-30-20_34_04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10524738/94762404-6fa6a980-035c-11eb-86e7-d42d3921169d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

I ended up using  \"excludeOnFailure\" or \"excluded\" in most cases but there is a mix. I renamed the BlacklistTracker to HealthTracker, but for the TaskSetBlacklist HealthTracker didn't make sense to me since its not the health of the taskset itself but rather tracking the things its excluded on so I renamed it to be TaskSetExcludeList.  Everything else I tried to use the context and in most cases excluded made sense. It made more sense to me then blocked since you are basically excluding those executors and nodes from scheduling tasks on them. Then can be unexcluded later after timeouts and such. The configs I changed the name to use excludeOnFailure which I thought explained it.\r\n\r\nI unfortunately couldn't get rid of some of them because its part of the event listener and history files.  To keep backwards compatibility I kept the events and some of the parsing so that the history server would still properly read older history files.  It is not forward compatible though - meaning a new application write the \"Excluded\" events so the older history server won't properly read display them as being blacklisted.\r\n\r\nA few of the files below are showing up as deleted and recreated even though I did a git mv on them. I'm not sure why.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAfter `SPARK-32851` set `CODEGEN_FACTORY_MODE` to `CODEGEN_ONLY` of `sparkConf` in `SharedSparkSessionBase`  to construction `SparkSession`  in test, the test suite `SPARK-32459: UDF should not fail on WrappedArray` in s.sql.UDFSuite exposed a codegen fallback issue in Scala 2.13 as follow:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- SPARK-32459: UDF should not fail on WrappedArray *** FAILED ***\r\nCaused by: org.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompileException: File 'generated.java', Line 47, Column 99: failed to compile: org.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompileException: File 'generated.java', Line 47, Column 99: No applicable constructor/method found for zero actual parameters; candidates are: \"public scala.collection.mutable.Builder scala.collection.mutable.ArraySeq$.newBuilder(java.lang.Object)\", \"public scala.collection.mutable.Builder scala.collection.mutable.ArraySeq$.newBuilder(scala.reflect.ClassTag)\", \"public abstract scala.collection.mutable.Builder scala.collection.EvidenceIterableFactory.newBuilder(java.lang.Object)\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe root cause is `WrappedArray` represent `mutable.ArraySeq`  in Scala 2.13 and has a different constructor of `newBuilder` method.\r\n\r\nThe main change of is pr is add Scala 2.13 only code part to deal with  `case match WrappedArray` in Scala 2.13.\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe need to support a Scala 2.13 build\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Scala 2.12: Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n\r\n- Scala 2.13: All tests passed.\r\n\r\nDo the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndev/change-scala-version.sh 2.13\r\nmvn clean install -DskipTests  -pl sql/core -Pscala-2.13

CVE-2020-11023) affecting older versions of jQuery. Although Spark UI is read-only and those CVEs doesn't seem to affect Spark, using the latest version of this library can help to handle vulnerability reports of security scans.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual tests and checked the jQuery 3.5 upgrade guide.\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-29T12:50:15Z","updated_at":"2020-10-01T08:51:00Z","closed_at":"2020-10-01T04:30:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9a06ffad0fc986cc94e63940db086e86ef5447c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUse `Utils.getSimpleName` to avoid hitting `Malformed class name` error in `TreeNode`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOn older JDK versions (e.g. JDK8u), nested Scala classes may trigger `java.lang.Class.getSimpleName` to throw an `java.lang.InternalError: Malformed class name` error.\r\n\r\nSimilar to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29050, we should use  Spark's `Utils.getSimpleName` utility function in place of `Class.getSimpleName` to avoid hitting the issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nFixes a bug that throws an error when invoking `TreeNode.nodeName`, otherwise no changes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new unit test case in `TreeNodeSuite`. Note that the test case assumes the test code can trigger the expected error, otherwise it'll skip the test safely, for compatibility with newer JDKs.\r\n\r\nManually tested on JDK8u and JDK11u and observed expected behavior:\r\n- JDK8u: the test case triggers the \"Malformed class name\" issue and the fix works;\r\n- JDK11u: the test case does not trigger the \"Malformed class name\" issue, and the test case is safely skipped.","created_at":"2020-09-28T22:51:29Z","updated_at":"2020-09-29T02:16:11Z","closed_at":"2020-09-29T00:16:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"51a303c9dfe3ca560bbce182e73b40e687f4fc25","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29896/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29896/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29896/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/94b6348ead6456def08ab739e22056745196123f","head":{"label":"rednaxelafx:spark-32999-getsimplename-2.4","ref":"spark-32999-getsimplename-2.4","sha":"94b6348ead6456def08ab739e22056745196123f","user":{"login":"rednaxelafx","id":107834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzgzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx","html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":89513466,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4OTUxMzQ2Ng==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"rednaxelafx/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rednaxelafx","id":107834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzgzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx","html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\nApache Spark 3.1's default Hadoop profile is `hadoop-3.2`. Instead of having a warning documentation, this PR aims to use a consistent and safer version of Apache Hadoop file output committer algorithm which is `v1`. This will prevent a silent correctness regression during migration from Apache Spark 2.4/3.0 to Apache Spark 3.1.0. Of course, if there is a user-provided configuration, `spark.hadoop.mapreduce.fileoutputcommitter.algorithm.version=2`, that will be used still.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nApache Spark provides multiple distributions with Hadoop 2.7 and Hadoop 3.2. `spark.hadoop.mapreduce.fileoutputcommitter.algorithm.version` depends on the Hadoop version. Apache Hadoop 3.0 switches the default algorithm from `v1` to `v2` and now there exists a discussion to remove `v2`. We had better provide a consistent default behavior of `v1` across various Spark distributions.\r\n\r\n- [MAPREDUCE-7282](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-7282) MR v2 commit algorithm should be deprecated and not the default\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. This changes the default behavior. Users can override this conf.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE (spark-3.0.1-bin-hadoop3.2)**\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sc.version\r\nres0: String = 3.0.1\r\n\r\nscala>

\r\n\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n \r\n#### JIRA expectations\r\n```\r\n   INSERT currently does not support named column lists.  \r\n   \r\n   INSERT INTO <table> (col1, col2,…) VALUES( 'val1', 'val2', … )\r\n   Note, we assume the column list contains all the column names. Issue an exception if the list is not complete. The column order could be different from the column order defined in the table definition.    \r\n```\r\n#### implemetations\r\nIn this PR, we add a column list  as an optional part to the `INSERT OVERWRITE/INTO` statements:\r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * {{{\r\n   *   INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE tableIdentifier [partitionSpec [IF NOT EXISTS]]? [identifierList] ...\r\n   *   INSERT INTO [TABLE] tableIdentifier [partitionSpec]  [identifierList] ...\r\n   * }}}\r\n   */\r\n```\r\nThe column list represents all expected columns with an explicit order that you want to insert to the target table. **Particularly**,  we assume the column list contains all the column names in the current implementation, it will fail when the list is incomplete.\r\n\r\nIn **Analyzer**, we add a code path to resolve the column list in the `ResolveOutputRelation` rule before it is transformed to v1 or v2 command. It will fail here if the list has any field that not belongs to the target table.\r\n\r\nThen, for v2 command, e.g. `AppendData`, we use the resolved column list and output of the target table to resolve the output of the source query `ResolveOutputRelation` rule. If the list has duplicated columns, we fail. If the list is not empty but the list size does not match the target table, we fail. If no other exceptions occur, we use the column list to map the output of the source query to the output of the target table.  The column list will be set to Nil and it will not hit the rule again after it is resolved.\r\n\r\nfor v1 command, those all happen in the `PreprocessTableInsertion` rule\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n new feature support\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes, insert into/overwrite table support specify column list\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`REGEXP_REPLACE` could replace all substrings of string that match regexp with replacement string.\r\nBut `REGEXP_REPLACE` lost some flexibility. such as: converts camel case strings to a string containing lower case words separated by an underscore:\r\nAddressLine1 -> address_line_1\r\nIf we support the parameter position, we can do like this(e.g. Oracle):\r\n\r\n```\r\nWITH strings as (   \r\n  SELECT 'AddressLine1' s FROM dual union all   \r\n  SELECT 'ZipCode' s FROM dual union all   \r\n  SELECT 'Country' s FROM dual   \r\n)   \r\n  SELECT s \"STRING\",  \r\n         lower(regexp_replace(s, '([A-Z0-9])', '_\\1', 2)) \"MODIFIED_STRING\"  \r\n  FROM strings;\r\n```\r\nThe output:\r\n```\r\n  STRING               MODIFIED_STRING\r\n-------------------- --------------------\r\nAddressLine1         address_line_1\r\nZipCode              zip_code\r\nCountry              country\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are some

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCompute the current date at the specified time zone using timestamp taken at the start of query evaluation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAccording to the doc for [current_date()](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/#current_date), the current date should be computed at the start of query evaluation but it can be computed multiple times. As a consequence of that, the function can return different values if the query is executed at the border of two dates.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites `ComputeCurrentTimeSuite` and `DateExpressionsSuite`.","created_at":"2020-09-28T08:33:40Z","updated_at":"2020-12-11T20:28:15Z","closed_at":"2020-09-29T05:13:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ac083a1040b2731da5057d27fb3e8d5757291759","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29889/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29889/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29889/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/92b4a9e7e125e5a5b79eb3700bb1878006701c6d","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-current_date","ref":"fix-current_date","sha":"92b4a9e7e125e5a5b79eb3700bb1878006701c6d","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to promote the stability annotation to `Evolving` for MLEvent traits/classes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe feature is released in Spark 3.0.0 having SPARK-26818 as the last change in Feb. 2020, and haven't changed in Spark 3.0.1. (There's no change more than a half of year.)\r\n\r\nWhile we'd better to wait for some minor releases to consider the API as stable, it would worth to promote to Evolving so that we clearly state that we support the API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJust changed the annotation, no tests required.","created_at":"2020-09-28T04:45:26Z","updated_at":"2020-09-28T06:27:54Z","closed_at":"2020-09-28T05:58:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aa472f6128ef0e3d159e230a0e03a3f56e2686fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29887/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29887/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29887/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/841eecc34a4a80b48e11ade7bf606a44b349e181","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-33011","ref":"SPARK-33011","sha":"841eecc34a4a80b48e11ade7bf606a44b349e181","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport `spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars` use HDFS location.\r\n\r\nWhen user need to use path to set hive metastore jars, you should set \r\n`spark.sql.hive.metasstore.jars=path` and set real path in `spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars.path`\r\nsince we use `File.pathSeperator` to split path, but `FIle.pathSeparator` is `:` in unix, it will split hdfs location `hdfs://nameservice/xx`. So add new config `spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars.path` to set comma separated paths.\r\nTo keep both two way supported\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAll spark app can fetch internal version hive jars in HDFS location, not need distribute to all node.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser can use HDFS location to store hive metastore jars\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManuel tested.","created_at":"2020-09-27T04:20:05Z","updated_at":"2020-10-22T13:53:14Z","closed_at":"2020-10-22T13:53:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d725ec185425b7ea0bea9a3736c4430ae546246a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29881/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29881/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29881/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ea9ef2bbfd8c2314605ae8e4daa12d2b77b31e62","head":{"label":"AngersZhuuuu:SPARK-32852","ref":"SPARK-32852","sha":"ea9ef2bbfd8c2314605ae8e4daa12d2b77b31e62","user":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176224753,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYyMjQ3NTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"AngersZhuuuu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to migrate `DESCRIBE tbl colname` to use `UnresolvedTableOrView` to resolve the table/view identifier. This allows consistent resolution rules (temp view first, etc.) to be applied for both v1/v2 commands. More info about the consistent resolution rule proposal can be found in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900) or [proposal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvLjGA8y_W_hhilpngXVub1Ebv8RsMap986nENCFnrg/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe current behavior is not consistent between v1 and v2 commands when resolving a temp view.\r\nIn v2, the `t` in the following example is resolved to a table:\r\n```scala\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE testcat.ns.t (id bigint) USING foo\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW t AS SELECT 2 as i\")\r\nsql(\"USE testcat.ns\")\r\nsql(\"DESCRIBE t i\") // 't' is resolved to testcat.ns.t\r\n\r\nDescribing columns is not supported for v2 tables.;\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Describing columns is not supported for v2 tables.;\r\n```\r\nwhereas in v1, the `t` is resolved to a temp view:\r\n```scala\r\nsql(\"CREATE DATABASE test\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE spark_catalog.test.t (id bigint) USING csv\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW t AS SELECT 2 as i\")\r\nsql(\"USE spark_catalog.test\")\r\nsql(\"DESCRIBE t i\").show // 't' is resolved to a temp view\r\n\r\n+---------+----------+\r\n|info_name|info_value|\r\n+---------+----------+\r\n| col_name|         i|\r\n|data_type|       int|\r\n|  comment|      NULL|\r\n+---------+----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nAfter this PR, `DESCRIBE t i` is resolved to a temp view `t` instead of `testcat.ns.t`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUse `Utils.getSimpleName` to avoid hitting `Malformed class name` error in `TreeNode`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOn older JDK versions (e.g. JDK8u), nested Scala classes may trigger `java.lang.Class.getSimpleName` to throw an `java.lang.InternalError: Malformed class name` error.\r\n\r\nSimilar to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29050, we should use  Spark's `Utils.getSimpleName` utility function in place of `Class.getSimpleName` to avoid hitting the issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nFixes a bug that throws an error when invoking `TreeNode.nodeName`, otherwise no changes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new unit test case in `TreeNodeSuite`. Note that the test case assumes the test code can trigger the expected error, otherwise it'll skip the test safely, for compatibility with newer JDKs.\r\n\r\nManually tested on JDK8u and JDK11u and observed expected behavior:\r\n- JDK8u: the test case triggers the \"Malformed class name\" issue and the fix works;\r\n- JDK11u: the test case does not trigger the \"Malformed class name\" issue, and the test case is safely

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Building spark internally in orgs where access to outside internet is not allowed takes a long time because unsuccessful attempts are made to download artifacts from repositories which are not accessible. The unsuccessful attempts unnecessarily add significant amount of time to the build. I have seen a difference of up-to 1hr for some runs. \r\n- Adding 1 environment variables that should be present that the start of the build and if they exist, override the default repos defined in the code and scripts.\r\nenvVariables: \r\n      - DEFAULT_ARTIFACT_REPOSITORY=https://artifacts.internal.com/libs-release/\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo allow orgs to build spark internally without relying on external repositories for artifact downloads.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nMultiple builds with and without env variables

Since the driver PVC shares the lifecycle of driver pod, it will exist after the job completion until the pod deletion. However, if the users are already using pre-populated PVCs, this isn't a regression at all in terms of the cost.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ k get pod -l spark-role=driver\r\nNAME                            READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE\r\ntpcds-d6087874c6705564-driver   0/1     Completed   0          35m\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nLike executors, driver also needs larger PVC.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. This is a new feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the newly added test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen `peakMemoryMetrics` in `ExecutorSummary` is `Option.empty`, then the `ExecutorMetricsJsonSerializer#serialize` method does not execute the `jsonGenerator.writeObject` method. This causes the json to be generated with `peakMemoryMetrics` key added to the serialized string, but no corresponding value. \r\nThis causes an error to be thrown when it is the next key `attributes` turn to be added to the json:\r\n`com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonGenerationException: Can not write a field name, expecting a value\r\n`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAt the start of the Spark job, if `peakMemoryMetrics` is `Option.empty`, then it causes \r\na `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonGenerationException` to be thrown when we navigate to the Executors tab in Spark

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a new accumulator prefix `external.heavy.` to determine the heavy accumulators. These accumulators will be handled before entering into `eventProcessLoop`. This could avoid the driver holding the heavy accumulators in the event loop for a long time. Then the driver memory could be release in young GC.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe use Spark + Delta Lake, recently we find our Spark driver faced full GC problem (very heavy) when users submit a MERGE INTO query. The driver held over 100GB memory (depends on how much the max heap size set) and can not be GC forever. By making a heap dump we found the root cause. More details about the issue and the patch testing result, see [SPARK-32994](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32994)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"839\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-09-25 at 11 35 01 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1853780/94225514-c3159380-ff27-11ea-9b29-22bb4fa77533.png\">\r\n\r\nFrom above heap dump, Delta uses a SetAccumulator to records touched files names\r\n```scala\r\n    // Accumulator to collect all the distinct touched files\r\n    val touchedFilesAccum = new SetAccumulator[String]()\r\n    spark.sparkContext.register(touchedFilesAccum, TOUCHED_FILES_ACCUM_NAME)\r\n\r\n    // UDFs to records touched files names and add them to the accumulator\r\n    val recordTouchedFileName = udf { (fileName: String) => {\r\n      touchedFilesAccum.add(fileName)\r\n      1\r\n    }}.asNondeterministic()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn a big query, each task may hold thousands of file names, and if a stage contains dozens of thousands of tasks, DAGscheduler may hold millions of `CompletionEvent`. And each `CompletionEvent` holds the thousands of file names in its `accumUpdates`. All accumulator objects will use Spark listener event to deliver to the event loop and even a full GC can not release memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd a UT\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-25T04:14:02Z","updated_at":"2021-04-12T00:19:45Z","closed_at":"2021-04-12T00:19:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"236629ec904cd86fa577a0640b0e3eb21c97ae90","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29869/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29869/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29869/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d9ecb25257827a85db6b536c5dc7fc270ef24ec2","head":{"label":"LantaoJin:SPARK-32994","ref":"SPARK-32994","sha":"d9ecb25257827a85db6b536c5dc7fc270ef24ec2","user":{"login":"LantaoJin","id":1853780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM3ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1853780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin","html_url":"https://github.com/LantaoJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":90969496,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MDk2OTQ5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"LantaoJin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LantaoJin","id":1853780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM3ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1853780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin","html_url":"https://github.com/LantaoJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LantaoJin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of SPARK-32889 in order to ignore the special column names test in `hive-1.2` profile.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nHive 1.2 is too old to support special column names because it doesn't use Apache ORC. This will recover our `hive-1.2` Jenkins job.\r\n- https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/Spark%20QA%20Test%20(Dashboard)/job/spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.7-hive-1.2/\r\n-

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to migrate `REFRESH TABLE` to use `UnresolvedTableOrView` to resolve the table/view identifier. This allows consistent resolution rules (temp view first, etc.) to be applied for both v1/v2 commands. More info about the consistent resolution rule proposal can be found in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900) or [proposal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvLjGA8y_W_hhilpngXVub1Ebv8RsMap986nENCFnrg/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe current behavior is not consistent between v1 and v2 commands when resolving a temp view.\r\nIn v2, the `t` in the following example is resolved to a table:\r\n```scala\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE testcat.ns.t (id bigint) USING foo\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW t AS SELECT 2\")\r\nsql(\"USE testcat.ns\")\r\nsql(\"REFRESH TABLE t\") // 't' is resolved to testcat.ns.t\r\n```\r\nwhereas in v1, the `t` is resolved to a temp view:\r\n```scala\r\nsql(\"CREATE DATABASE test\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE spark_catalog.test.t (id bigint) USING csv\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW t AS SELECT 2\")\r\nsql(\"USE spark_catalog.test\")\r\nsql(\"REFRESH TABLE t\") // 't' is resolved to a temp view\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nAfter this PR, `REFRESH TABLE t` is resolved to a temp view `t` instead of `testcat.ns.t`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a new test\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-24T21:10:19Z","updated_at":"2020-09-25T04:29:23Z","closed_at":"2020-09-25T04:29:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3fd6235052ebc7bb9b5bcc0f2b887cabc68f9001","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29866/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29866/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29866/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d1051c6fad37993a299ed79617f574d6ce51c890","head":{"label":"imback82:refresh_table_consistent","ref":"refresh_table_consistent","sha":"d1051c6fad37993a299ed79617f574d6ce51c890","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn [SPARK-16896](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16896) (headerFlag=true), some new column names are generated to replace duplicate column names or empty string column names in the CSV data source.\r\n\r\n> The behavior of SPARK-16896 is as follows:\r\n>\r\n> 1. Empty string name -> `s\"_c$index\"`\r\n> E.g: `\", , a, \"` -> `\"_c0, _c1, a, _c3\"`\r\n> 2. Duplicate name -> `s\"$name$index\"`\r\n> E.g: `\"c, a, b, a\"` -> `\"c, a1, b, a3\"`\r\n>\r\n\r\nIn this PR [SPARK-32956](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32956), on the basis of keeping the user-facing behavior of SPARK-16896 unchanged, the column name generation logic is modified to ensure that the newly generated column name will not duplicate the existing column name.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen the CSV data source has duplicate column names, Spark will generate some new column names based on the original column names, and use the index as the suffix.\r\n\r\nWhen the newly generated column name is duplicated with the existing column name, Spark will throw an exception message that is difficult for users to understand.\r\n\r\nE.g: `a, a, a, a1` ( -> `a0, a1, a2, a1`)\r\n\r\n> AnalysisException: Duplicate column found in data schema a1\r\n\r\nE.g: `a, , _c1` ( -> `a, _c1, _c1`)\r\n> AnalysisException: Duplicate column found in data

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add the caret hints, e.g., `^^^^^`,  to the approved and actual plans where they first become different.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt's hard to find the difference between the approved and actual plan since the plans of TPC-DS queries are often huge. Adding the hints would help developers to locate the plan differences quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, after this change, there're hits added to the plans to highlight the differences.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTested

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nApache Spark 3.0 switches its Hive execution version from 1.2 to 2.3, but it still provides the unofficial forked Hive 1.2 version from our distribution like the following. This PR aims to remove it from Apache Spark 3.1.0 officially while keeping `hive-1.2` profile.\r\n```\r\nspark-3.0.1-bin-hadoop2.7-hive1.2.tgz\r\nspark-3.0.1-bin-hadoop2.7-hive1.2.tgz.asc\r\nspark-3.0.1-bin-hadoop2.7-hive1.2.tgz.sha512 \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe unofficial Hive 1.2.1 fork has many bugs and is not maintained for a long time. We had better not recommend this in the official Apache Spark distribution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThere is no user-facing change in the default distribution (Hadoop 3.2/Hive 2.3).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually because this is a change in release script

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is the first patch for SPIP SPARK-30602 for push-based shuffle.\r\nSummary of changes:\r\n* Introduce new API in ExternalBlockStoreClient to push blocks to a remote shuffle service.\r\n* Leveraging the streaming upload functionality in SPARK-6237, it also enables the ExternalBlockHandler to delegate the handling of block push requests to MergedShuffleFileManager.\r\n* Propose the API for MergedShuffleFileManager, where the core logic on the shuffle service side to handle block push requests is defined. The actual implementation of this API is deferred into a later RB to restrict the size of this PR.\r\n* Introduce OneForOneBlockPusher to enable pushing blocks to remote shuffle services in shuffle RPC layer.\r\n* New protocols in shuffle RPC layer to support the functionalities.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nRefer to the SPIP in SPARK-30602\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\nThe reference PR with the consolidated changes covering the complete implementation is also provided in SPARK-30602.\r\nWe have already verified the functionality and the improved performance as documented in the SPIP doc.\r\n\r\nLead-authored-by: Min Shen <mshen@linkedin.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Chandni

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to replace current examples for `percentile_approx()` with **only one** input value by example **with multiple values** in the input column.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent examples are pretty trivial, and don't demonstrate function's behaviour on a sequence of values.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- by running `ExpressionInfoSuite`\r\n- `./dev/scalastyle`\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk <max.gekk@gmail.com>\r\nSigned-off-by:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMore precise description of the result of the `percentile_approx()` function and its synonym `approx_percentile()`. The proposed sentence clarifies that  the function returns **one of elements** (or array of elements) from the input column.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve Spark docs and avoid misunderstanding of the function behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n`./dev/scalastyle`\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk
