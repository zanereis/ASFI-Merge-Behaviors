What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nUsing the public `Catalog` API, users can create a file-based data source table, without giving the path options. For this case, currently we can create the table successfully, but fail when we read it. Ideally we should fail during creation.\n\nThis is because when we create data source table, we resolve the data source relation without validating path: `resolveRelation(checkPathExist = false)`.\n\nLooking back to why we add this trick(`checkPathExist`), it's because when we call `resolveRelation` for managed table, we add the path to data source options but the path is not created yet. So why we add this not-yet-created path to data source options? This PR fix the problem by adding path to options after we call `resolveRelation`. Then we can remove the `checkPathExist` parameter in `DataSource.resolveRelation` and do some related cleanups.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting tests and new test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nPorts https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14841 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14910 from `master` to `branch-2.0`\n\nJira : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17271\n\nPlanner is adding un-needed SORT operation due to bug in the way comparison for `SortOrder` is done at https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/exchange/EnsureRequirements.scala#L253 \n`SortOrder` needs to be compared semantically because `Expression` within two `SortOrder` can be \"semantically equal\" but not literally equal objects.\n\neg. In case of `sql(\"SELECT * FROM table1 a JOIN table2 b ON a.col1=b.col1\")`\n\nExpression in required SortOrder:\n\n```\n      AttributeReference(\n        name = \"col1\",\n        dataType = LongType,\n        nullable = false\n      ) (exprId = exprId,\n        qualifier = Some(\"a\")\n      )\n```\n\nExpression in child SortOrder:\n\n```\n      AttributeReference(\n        name = \"col1\",\n        dataType = LongType,\n        nullable = false\n      ) (exprId = exprId)\n```\n\nNotice that the output column has a qualifier but the child attribute does not but the inherent expression is the same and hence in this case we can say that the child satisfies the required sort order.\n\nThis PR includes following changes:\n- Added a `semanticEquals` method to `SortOrder` so that it can compare underlying child expressions semantically (and not using default Object.equals)\n- Fixed `EnsureRequirements` to use semantic comparison of SortOrder\n## How was this patch tested?\n- Added a test case to `PlannerSuite`. Ran rest tests in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR fixes `ColumnVectorUtils.populate` so that Parquet vectorized reader can read partitioned table with dates/timestamps. This works fine with Parquet normal reader.\n\nThis is being only called within [VectorizedParquetRecordReader.java#L185](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/parquet/VectorizedParquetRecordReader.java#L185). \n\nWhen partition column types are explicitly given to `DateType` or `TimestampType` (rather than inferring the type of partition column), this fails with the exception below:\n\n```\n16/09/01

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAvoid useless iteration within 'data' structure when creating a data frame from local data (so when createDataFrame uses _createFromLocal) and when 'data' is a Python generator (instead of a 'list' or a dataframe)\n- if schema is provided, only iterate once (in _createFromLocal). In this case we skip 1 struction iteration\n- if no schema is provided, we skip the useless 'map' with the 'identify' lambda function\n\nThere are still serialization to the JVM.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPyspark unit tests and standalone manual pyspark execution\n","created_at":"2016-09-01T12:31:59Z","updated_at":"2019-04-30T06:24:37Z","closed_at":"2017-01-25T12:23:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8c3549ba0933722cb3bf1373e1ac42ab3f75c300","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14918/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14918/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14918/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8b85d63e0498def276bdcb945986ce3776ec6531","head":{"label":"gsemet:generate_in_createdf","ref":"generate_in_createdf","sha":"8b85d63e0498def276bdcb945986ce3776ec6531","user":{"login":"gsemet","id":133498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsemet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62233595,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjIzMzU5NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gsemet/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gsemet","id":133498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQ5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsemet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsemet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gsemet/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn `ReorderAssociativeOperator` rule, we extract foldable expressions with Add/Multiply arithmetics, and replace with eval literal. For example, `(a + 1) + (b + 2)` is optimized to `(a + b + 3)` by this rule.\nFor aggregate operator, output expressions should be derived from groupingExpressions, current implemenation of `ReorderAssociativeOperator` rule may break this promise. A instance could be:\n\n```\nSELECT\n  ((t1.a + 1) + (t2.a + 2)) AS out_col\nFROM\n  testdata2 AS t1\nINNER JOIN\n  testdata2 AS t2\nON\n  (t1.a = t2.a)\nGROUP BY (t1.a + 1), (t2.a + 2)\n```\n\n`((t1.a + 1) + (t2.a + 2))` is optimized to `(t1.a + t2.a + 3)`, which could not be derived from `ExpressionSet((t1.a +1), (t2.a + 2))`.\nMaybe we should improve the rule of `ReorderAssociativeOperator` by adding a GroupingExpressionSet to keep Aggregate.groupingExpressions, and respect these expressions during the optimize stage.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdd new test case in `ReorderAssociativeOperatorSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-09-01T10:57:28Z","updated_at":"2016-10-17T08:23:17Z","closed_at":"2016-09-13T15:07:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2128103c9b6628f2cb594fe900a659e137e092b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14917/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14917/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14917/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dc3b1b288d7340183250acf2765da61497790c64","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:rao","ref":"rao","sha":"dc3b1b288d7340183250acf2765da61497790c64","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nclass `org.apache.spark.sql.types.Metadata` is widely used in mllib to store some ml attributes. `Metadata` is commonly stored in `Alias` expression. \n\n```\ncase class Alias(child: Expression, name: String)(\n    val exprId: ExprId = NamedExpression.newExprId,\n    val qualifier: Option[String] = None,\n    val explicitMetadata: Option[Metadata] = None,\n    override val isGenerated: java.lang.Boolean = false)\n```\n\nThe `Metadata` can take a big memory footprint since the number of attributes is big ( in scale of million). When `toJSON` is called on `Alias` expression, the `Metadata` will also be converted to a big JSON string. \nIf a plan contains many such kind of `Alias` expressions, it may trigger out of memory error when `toJSON` is called, since converting all `Metadata` references to JSON will take huge memory.\n\nWith this PR, we will skip scanning Metadata when doing JSON conversion. For a reproducer of the OOM, and analysis, please look at jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17356. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests.\n","created_at":"2016-09-01T09:07:45Z","updated_at":"2016-09-06T08:08:16Z","closed_at":"2016-09-06T08:08:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"87ee0a6c8a3c99b6fc71661dafcbc5ec8671270f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14915/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14915/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14915/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/20fa7e37946267b7a126653ba81270a404497e45","head":{"label":"clockfly:json_oom","ref":"json_oom","sha":"20fa7e37946267b7a126653ba81270a404497e45","user":{"login":"clockfly","id":2595532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTU1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly","html_url":"https://github.com/clockfly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":57937220,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NzkzNzIyMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"clockfly/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"clockfly","id":2595532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTU1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly","html_url":"https://github.com/clockfly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/clockfly/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCached table(parquet/orc) couldn't be shard between beelines, because the `sameResult` method used by `CacheManager` always return false(`sparkSession` are different) when compare two `HadoopFsRelation` in different beelines. So we make `sparkSession` a curry parameter.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nBeeline1\n\n```\n1: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> CACHE TABLE src_pqt;\n+---------+--+\n| Result

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently some predicates, which should be pushdown, will not be correctly pushdown in `Optimizer`.\n### Predicates simplified to the form that can't be push down before they are pushed down\n\nIn `Optimizer`, `Filter` operator will go through the rules `PushDownPredicate`, `CombineFilters` and `BooleanSimplification`.\n\nUnder this rule order, it is possibly that some predicates that should be able to push down, can't be pushed down through operators.\n\nBecause `Filter` will not pushdown through another `Filter` node and will wait for combination in the rule `CombineFilters` later. After the `Filter`s are combined, `BooleanSimplification` will simplify conditions in the combined `Filter` and make some predicates, which are able to push down, become unable to push down.\n\nThis is this change wants to fix.\n### Predicates are in the form unable to push down at the beginning\n\nWe may need to come out an approach to maintain multiple forms of predicates which at least can benefit pushdown and expression simplification. This will leave to later PRs. Need more discussion.\n### Change in this patch\n\nAfter `Filter`s are combined in `CombineFilters`, this change triggers `PushDownPredicates` immediately to push down the combined predicates. So the combined predicates will not be simplified by `BooleanSimplification` before pushing down.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins tests.\n","created_at":"2016-09-01T06:51:46Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:19:55Z","closed_at":"2016-10-06T01:51:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b14651ad9d56723944376b563c041829918f9cee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14912/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14912/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14912/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f69473fd3f09f8b11fe63eff07ab72dfce9fee96","head":{"label":"viirya:simplified-predicate-pushdown","ref":"simplified-predicate-pushdown","sha":"f69473fd3f09f8b11fe63eff07ab72dfce9fee96","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAttempting to use Spark SQL's JDBC data source against the Hive ThriftServer results in a `java.sql.SQLException: Method` not supported exception from `org.apache.hive.jdbc.HiveResultSetMetaData.isSigned`. Here are two user reports of this issue:\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34067686/spark-1-5-1-not-working-with-hive-jdbc-1-2-0\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32195946/method-not-supported-in-spark\n\nI have filed [HIVE-14684](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-14684) to attempt to fix this in Hive by implementing the isSigned method, but in the meantime / for compatibility with older JDBC drivers I think we should add special-case error handling to work around this bug.\n\nThis patch updates `JDBCRDD`'s `ResultSetMetadata` to schema conversion to catch the \"Method not supported\" exception from Hive and return `isSigned = true`. I believe that this is safe because, as far as I know, Hive does not support unsigned numeric types.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested manually against a Spark Thrift Server.\n","created_at":"2016-09-01T05:54:24Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T23:47:47Z","closed_at":"2016-09-01T23:47:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8985b922452a69471cb53c007fb56a80f62f94dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14911/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14911/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14911/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6b56880aa78a599fdf255d3668a848d9ad09691b","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:hive-jdbc-workaround","ref":"hive-jdbc-workaround","sha":"6b56880aa78a599fdf255d3668a848d9ad09691b","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

patch refactors the internals of the JDBC data source in order to allow some of its code to be re-used in an automated comparison testing harness. Here are the key changes:\n- Move the JDBC `ResultSetMetadata` to `StructType` conversion logic from `JDBCRDD.resolveTable()` to the `JdbcUtils` object (as a new `getSchema(ResultSet, JdbcDialect)` method), allowing it to be applied on `ResultSet`s that are created elsewhere.\n- Move the `ResultSet` to `InternalRow` conversion methods from `JDBCRDD` to `JdbcUtils`:\n  - It makes sense to move the `JDBCValueGetter` type and `makeGetter` functions here given that their write-path counterparts (`JDBCValueSetter`) are already in `JdbcUtils`.\n  - Add an internal `resultSetToSparkInternalRows` method which takes a `ResultSet` and schema and returns an `Iterator[InternalRow]`. This effectively extracts the main loop of `JDBCRDD` into its own method.\n  - Add a public `resultSetToRows` method to `JdbcUtils`, which wraps the minimal machinery around `resultSetToSparkInternalRows` in order to allow it to be called from outside of a Spark job.\n- Make `JdbcDialect.get` into a `DeveloperApi` (`JdbcDialect` itself is already a `DeveloperApi`).\n\nPut together, these changes enable the following testing pattern:\n\n``` scala\nval jdbResultSet: ResultSet = conn.prepareStatement(query).executeQuery()\nval resultSchema: StructType = JdbcUtils.getSchema(jdbResultSet, JdbcDialects.get(\"jdbc:postgresql\"))\nval jdbcRows: Seq[Row] = JdbcUtils.resultSetToRows(jdbResultSet, schema).toSeq\ncheckAnswer(sparkResult, jdbcRows) // in a test case\n```\n","created_at":"2016-09-01T00:49:51Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T08:24:02Z","closed_at":"2016-09-02T16:56:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"375221eeef39746a0b6366c0ff0438e522c50e12","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14907/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14907/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14907/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f09174b03a27b9fcd8ed6c28608a16a5433a5b19","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:modularize-jdbc-internals","ref":"modularize-jdbc-internals","sha":"f09174b03a27b9fcd8ed6c28608a16a5433a5b19","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

SPARK-4761 / #3621 (December 2014) we enabled Kryo serialization by default in the Spark Thrift Server. However, I don't think that the original rationale for doing this still holds now that most Spark SQL serialization is now performed via encoders and our UnsafeRow format.\n\nIn addition, the use of Kryo as the default serializer can introduce performance problems because the creation of new KryoSerializer instances is expensive and we haven't performed instance-reuse optimizations in several code paths (including DirectTaskResult deserialization).\n\nGiven all of this, I propose to revert back to using JavaSerializer as the default serializer in the Thrift Server.\n\n/cc

what is done in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14156\nin that PR the `ApplyInPlace` cannot be optimized because the function may be anything.\nbut here we know that it is only matrix

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nGlobal temporary view is a cross-session temporary view, which means it's shared among all sessions. Its lifetime is the lifetime of the Spark application, i.e. it will be automatically dropped when the application terminates. It's tied to a system preserved database `global_temp`(configurable via SparkConf), and we must use the qualified name to refer a global temp view, e.g. SELECT \\* FROM global_temp.view1.\n\nchanges for `SessionCatalog`:\n1. add a new field `gloabalTempViews: GlobalTempViewManager`, to access the shared global temp views, and the global temp db name.\n2. `createDatabase` will fail if users wanna create `global_temp`, which is system preserved.\n3. `setCurrentDatabase` will fail if users wanna set `global_temp`, which is system preserved.\n4. add `createGlobalTempView`, which is used in `CreateViewCommand` to create global temp views.\n5. add `dropGlobalTempView`, which is used in `CatalogImpl` to drop global temp view.\n6. add `alterTempViewDefinition`, which is used in `AlterViewAsCommand` to update the view definition for local/global temp views.\n7. `renameTable`/`dropTable`/`isTemporaryTable`/`lookupRelation`/`getTempViewOrPermanentTableMetadata`/`refreshTable` will handle global temp views.\n\nchanges for SQL commands:\n1. `CreateViewCommand`/`AlterViewAsCommand` is updated to support global temp views\n2. `ShowTablesCommand` outputs a new column `database`, which is used to distinguish global and local temp views.\n3. other commands can also handle global temp views if they call `SessionCatalog` APIs which accepts global temp views, e.g. `DropTableCommand`, `AlterTableRenameCommand`, `ShowColumnsCommand`, etc.\n\nchanges for other public API\n1. add a new method `dropGlobalTempView` in `Catalog`\n2. `Catalog.findTable` can find global temp view\n3. add a new method `createGlobalTempView` in `Dataset`\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew tests in `SQLViewSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-08-31T14:49:29Z","updated_at":"2017-03-07T22:05:39Z","closed_at":"2016-10-10T07:51:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b976598843ae1ad0d5ff1bdcef7f8c48155ac879","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14897/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14897/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14897/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/29e292a954f1b07d80d03d0fd6c4ad4605b41ab7","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:global-temp-view","ref":"global-temp-view","sha":"29e292a954f1b07d80d03d0fd6c4ad4605b41ab7","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently we use `CreateViewCommand` to implement ALTER VIEW AS, which has 3 bugs:\n1. SPARK-17180: ALTER VIEW AS should alter temp view if view name has no database part and temp view exists\n2. SPARK-17309: ALTER VIEW AS should issue exception if view does not exist.\n3. SPARK-17323: ALTER VIEW AS should keep the previous table properties, comment, create_time, etc.\n\nThe root cause is, ALTER VIEW AS is quite different from CREATE VIEW, we need different code path to handle them. However, in `CreateViewCommand`, there is no way to distinguish ALTER VIEW AS and CREATE VIEW, we have to introduce extra flag. But instead of doing this, I think a more natural way is to separate the ALTER VIEW AS logic into a new command.\n\nbackport https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14874 to 2.0\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew tests in SQLViewSuite\n","created_at":"2016-08-31T10:28:45Z","updated_at":"2016-12-14T12:33:31Z","closed_at":"2016-09-01T01:01:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4c29e98bfc62ccce2564a40ce66afbf2ca33642d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14893/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14893/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14893/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6b328866e23dee91e43b35e773e3f736e1267bfb","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:minor4","ref":"minor4","sha":"6b328866e23dee91e43b35e773e3f736e1267bfb","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, `HiveContext` in SparkR is not being tested and always skipped.\nThis is because the initiation of `TestHiveContext` is being failed due to trying to load non-existing data paths (test tables).\n\nThis is introduced from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14005\n\nThis enables the tests with SparkR. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually, \n\n**Before** (on Mac OS)\n\n```\n...\nSkipped ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. create DataFrame from RDD (@test_sparkSQL.R#200) - Hive is not build with SparkSQL, skipped\n2. test HiveContext (@test_sparkSQL.R#1041) - Hive is not build with SparkSQL, skipped\n3. read/write ORC files (@test_sparkSQL.R#1748) - Hive is not build with SparkSQL, skipped\n4. enableHiveSupport on SparkSession (@test_sparkSQL.R#2480) - Hive is not build with SparkSQL, skipped\n5. sparkJars tag in SparkContext (@test_Windows.R#21) - This test is only for Windows, skipped\n...\n```\n\n**After** (on Mac OS)\n\n```\n...\nSkipped ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. sparkJars tag in SparkContext

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis is another step to get rid of HiveClient from `HiveSessionState`. All the metastore interactions should be through `ExternalCatalog` interface. However, the existing implementation of `InsertIntoHiveTable` still requires Hive clients. This PR is to remove HiveClient by moving the metastore interactions into `ExternalCatalog`.\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting test cases

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nback port of #14835 addressing merge conflicts\n\nWith the new History Server the summary page loads the application list via the the REST API, this makes it very slow to impossible to load with large (10K+) application history. This pr fixes this by adding the `spark.history.ui.maxApplications` conf to limit the number of applications the History Server displays. This is accomplished using a new optional `limit` param for the `applications` api. (Note this only applies to what the summary page displays, all the Application UI's are still accessible if the user knows the App ID and goes to the Application UI directly.)\n\nI've also added a new test for the `limit` param in `HistoryServerSuite.scala`\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual testing and dev/run-tests\n","created_at":"2016-08-30T21:58:25Z","updated_at":"2017-04-27T19:33:58Z","closed_at":"2016-08-31T15:35:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f2eadf05d5b98d2c26dc9da63c51e5ed0179b7ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14886/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14886/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14886/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/22ddf01727afa9cf57456c9f198a2bdbd9f1b028","head":{"label":"ajbozarth:spark17243-branch-2.0","ref":"spark17243-branch-2.0","sha":"22ddf01727afa9cf57456c9f198a2bdbd9f1b028","user":{"login":"ajbozarth","id":13952758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTUyNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13952758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbozarth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":41503793,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTUwMzc5Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"ajbozarth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ajbozarth","id":13952758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTUyNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13952758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbozarth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ajbozarth/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe added jar is shared by all the sessions, because SparkContext does not support sessions. Thus, it makes more sense to move `addJar` from `HiveSessionState` to `HiveSharedState`\n\nThis is another step to remove Hive client usage in `HiveSessionState`.\n\nDifferent sessions are sharing the same class loader (IsolatedClientLoader), and thus, `metadataHive.addJar(path)` basically loads the JARs for all the sessions. Thus, no impact is made if we move `addJar` from `HiveSessionState` to `HiveExternalCatalog`.\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nThe existing test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen a thread is a Netty's FastThreadLocalThread, Netty will use its fast ThreadLocal implementation. It has a better performance than JDK's (See the benchmark results in https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4417, note: it's not a fix to Netty's FastThreadLocal. It just fixed an issue in Netty's benchmark codes)\n\nThis PR just changed the ThreadFactory to Netty's DefaultThreadFactory which will use FastThreadLocalThread. There is also a minor change to the thread names. See https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/netty-4.0.22.Final/common/src/main/java/io/netty/util/concurrent/DefaultThreadFactory.java#L94\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently we use `CreateViewCommand` to implement ALTER VIEW AS, which has 3 bugs:\n1. SPARK-17180: ALTER VIEW AS should alter temp view if view name has no database part and temp view exists\n2. SPARK-17309: ALTER VIEW AS should issue exception if view does not exist.\n3. SPARK-17323: ALTER VIEW AS should keep the previous table properties, comment, create_time, etc.\n\nThe root cause is, ALTER VIEW AS is quite different from CREATE VIEW, we need different code path to handle them. However, in `CreateViewCommand`, there is no way to distinguish ALTER VIEW AS and CREATE VIEW, we have to introduce extra flag. But instead of doing this, I think a more natural way is to separate the ALTER VIEW AS logic into a new command.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew tests in SQLViewSuite\n","created_at":"2016-08-30T09:38:05Z","updated_at":"2016-08-31T09:11:10Z","closed_at":"2016-08-31T09:11:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"142ae4ff2ab6e5dd49e2128b0b8d3384477c0cef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14874/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14874/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14874/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8480945f2cc30972f33f1c55100c4263b83a3497","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:minor4","ref":"minor4","sha":"8480945f2cc30972f33f1c55100c4263b83a3497","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nBased on [Yggdrasil](https://github.com/fabuzaid21/yggdrasil), added local training of decision tree regressors.\n\nSome classes/objects largely correspond to Yggdrasil classes/objects.\nSpecifically:\n- class LocalDecisionTreeRegressor --> class YggdrasilRegressor\n- object LocalDecisionTree --> object YggdrasilRegression\n- object LocalDecisionTreeUtils --> object Yggdrasil\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded unit tests in (ml/tree/impl/LocalTreeTrainingSuite.scala) verifying that local & distributed training of a decision tree regressor produces the same

patch addresses a minor scheduler performance issue that was introduced in #13603. If you run\n\n```\nsc.parallelize(1 to 100000, 100000).map(identity).count()\n```\n\nthen most of the time ends up being spent in `TaskSetManager.abortIfCompletelyBlacklisted()`:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/50748/18071032/428732b0-6e07-11e6-88b2-c9423cd61f53.png)\n\nWhen processing resource offers, the scheduler uses a nested loop which considers every task set at multiple locality levels:\n\n``` scala\n   for (taskSet <- sortedTaskSets; maxLocality <- taskSet.myLocalityLevels) {\n      do {\n        launchedTask = resourceOfferSingleTaskSet(\n            taskSet, maxLocality, shuffledOffers, availableCpus, tasks)\n      } while (launchedTask)\n    }\n```\n\nIn order to prevent jobs with globally blacklisted tasks from hanging, #13603 added a `taskSet.abortIfCompletelyBlacklisted` call inside of  `resourceOfferSingleTaskSet`; if a call to `resourceOfferSingleTaskSet` fails to schedule any tasks, then `abortIfCompletelyBlacklisted` checks whether the tasks are completely blacklisted in order to figure out whether they will ever be schedulable. The problem with this placement of the call is that the last call to `resourceOfferSingleTaskSet` in the `while` loop will return `false`, implying that  `resourceOfferSingleTaskSet` will call `abortIfCompletelyBlacklisted`, so almost every call to `resourceOffers` will trigger the `abortIfCompletelyBlacklisted` check for every task set.\n\nInstead, I think that this call should be moved out of the innermost loop and should be called _at most_ once per task set in case none of the task set's tasks can be scheduled at any locality level.\n\nBefore this patch's changes, the microbenchmark example that I posted above took 35 seconds to run, but it now only takes 15 seconds after this change.\n\n/cc @squito and @kayousterhout for review.\n","created_at":"2016-08-30T00:13:29Z","updated_at":"2016-08-31T15:22:37Z","closed_at":"2016-08-30T20:18:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"24296f83aade4375a552077ab5df0bedcc2da4d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14871/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14871/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14871/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/321d0c685225f81a8415fb0796e907271d1995ab","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:bail-early-if-no-cpus","ref":"bail-early-if-no-cpus","sha":"321d0c685225f81a8415fb0796e907271d1995ab","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR implements aggregation function `percentile_approx`. Function `percentile_approx` returns the approximate percentile(s) of a column at the given percentage(s). A percentile is a watermark value below which a given percentage of the column values fall. For example, the percentile of column `col` at percentage 50% is the median value of column `col`. \n### Syntax:\n\n```\n# Returns percentile at a given percentage value. The approximation error can be reduced by increasing parameter accuracy, at the cost of memory.\npercentile_approx(col, percentage [, accuracy])\n\n# Returns percentile value array at given percentage value array \npercentile_approx(col, array(percentage1 [, percentage2]...) [, accuracy])\n```\n### Features:\n1. This function supports partial aggregation.\n2. The memory consumption is bounded. The larger `accuracy` parameter we choose, we smaller error we get. The default accuracy value is 10000, to match with Hive default setting. Choose a smaller value for smaller memory footprint. \n3.  This function supports window function aggregation.\n### Example usages:\n\n```\n## Returns the 25th percentile value, with default accuracy\nSELECT percentile_approx(col, 0.25) FROM table\n\n## Returns an array of percentile value (25th, 50th, 75th), with default accuracy\nSELECT percentile_approx(col, array(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)) FROM table\n\n## Returns 25th percentile value, with custom accuracy value 100, larger accuracy parameter yields smaller approximation error \nSELECT percentile_approx(col, 0.25, 100) FROM table\n\n## Returns the 25th, and 50th percentile values, with custom accuracy value 100\nSELECT percentile_approx(col, array(0.25, 0.5), 100) FROM table\n```\n### NOTE:\n1. The `percentile_approx` implementation is different from Hive, so the result returned on same query maybe slightly different with Hive. This implementation uses `QuantileSummaries` as the underlying probabilistic data structure, and mainly follows paper `Space-efficient Online Computation of Quantile Summaries` by Greenwald, Michael and Khanna, Sanjeev. (http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/375663.375670)`\n2. The current implementation of `QuantileSummaries` doesn't support automatic compression. This PR has a rule to do compression automatically at the caller side, but it may not be optimal.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test, and Sql query test.\n## Acknowledgement\n1. This PR's work in based on @lw-lin's PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14298, with improvements like supporting partial aggregation, fixing out of memory

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJoin processing in the parser relies on the fact that the grammar produces a right nested trees, for instance the parse tree for `select * from a join b join c` is expected to produce a tree similar to `JOIN(a, JOIN(b, c))`. However there are cases in which this (invariant) is violated, like:\n\n``` sql\nSELECT COUNT(1)\nFROM test T1 \n     CROSS JOIN test T2\n     JOIN test T3\n      ON T3.col = T1.col\n     JOIN test T4\n      ON T4.col = T1.col\n```\n\nIn this case the parser returns a tree in which Joins are located on both the left and the right sides of the parent join node.\n\nThis PR introduces a different grammar rule which does not make this assumption. The new rule takes a relation and searches for zero or more joined relations. As a bonus processing is much easier.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests and I have added a regression test to the plan parser suite.\n","created_at":"2016-08-29T20:34:50Z","updated_at":"2016-09-06T22:46:19Z","closed_at":"2016-09-06T22:46:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6913a0312eba984caee3984f59c5566949192401","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14867/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14867/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14867/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c30e665f8a228633398456d6893684c224e4d3ea","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-17296","ref":"SPARK-17296","sha":"c30e665f8a228633398456d6893684c224e4d3ea","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nRequire the use of CROSS join syntax in SQL (and a new crossJoin\nDataFrame API) to specify explicit cartesian products between relations.\nBy cartesian product we mean a join between relations R and S where\nthere is no join condition involving columns from both R and S.\n\nIf a cartesian product is detected in the absence of an explicit CROSS\njoin, an error must be thrown. Turning on the\n\"spark.sql.crossJoin.enabled\" configuration flag will disable this check\nand allow cartesian products without an explicit CROSS join.\n\nThe new crossJoin DataFrame API must be used to specify explicit cross\njoins. The existing join(DataFrame) method will produce a INNER join\nthat will require a subsequent join condition.\nThat is df1.join(df2) is equivalent to select \\* from df1, df2.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded cross-join.sql to the SQLQueryTestSuite to test the check for cartesian products. Added a couple of tests to the DataFrameJoinSuite to test the crossJoin API. Modified various other test suites to explicitly specify a cross join where an INNER join or a comma-separated list was previously used.\n","created_at":"2016-08-29T18:43:16Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T19:36:33Z","closed_at":"2016-09-02T22:22:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7d61c768bf526e94f5b7fe5de79c9dd1598e7422","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14866/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14866/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14866/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2509e451326d673ba6ea9d4d9a4e3991ea73b291","head":{"label":"srinathshankar:crossjoin","ref":"crossjoin","sha":"2509e451326d673ba6ea9d4d9a4e3991ea73b291","user":{"login":"srinathshankar","id":3208943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDg5NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3208943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinathshankar","html_url":"https://github.com/srinathshankar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinathshankar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinathshankar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinathshankar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinathshankar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinathshankar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinathshankar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinathshankar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinathshankar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinathshankar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66101422,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjEwMTQyMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"srinathshankar/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srinathshankar","id":3208943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDg5NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3208943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinathshankar","html_url":"https://github.com/srinathshankar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinathshankar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinathshankar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinathshankar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinathshankar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinathshankar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinathshankar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinathshankar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinathshankar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srinathshankar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srinathshankar/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nPartial aggregations are generated in `EnsureRequirements`, but the planner fails to\ncheck if partial aggregation satisfies sort requirements.\nFor the following query:\n\n```\nval df2 = (0 to 1000).map(x => (x % 2, x.toString)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"t2\")\nspark.sql(\"select max(b) from t2 group by a\").explain(true)\n```\n\nNow, the SortAggregator won't insert Sort operator before partial aggregation, this will break sort-based partial aggregation.\n\n```\n== Physical Plan ==\nSortAggregate(key=[a#5], functions=[max(b#6)], output=[max(b)#17])\n+- *Sort [a#5 ASC], false, 0\n   +- Exchange hashpartitioning(a#5, 200)\n      +- SortAggregate(key=[a#5], functions=[partial_max(b#6)], output=[a#5, max#19])\n         +- LocalTableScan [a#5, b#6]\n```\n\nActually, a correct plan is:\n\n```\n== Physical Plan ==\nSortAggregate(key=[a#5], functions=[max(b#6)], output=[max(b)#17])\n+- *Sort [a#5 ASC], false, 0\n   +- Exchange hashpartitioning(a#5, 200)\n      +- SortAggregate(key=[a#5], functions=[partial_max(b#6)], output=[a#5, max#19])\n         +- *Sort [a#5 ASC], false, 0\n            +- LocalTableScan [a#5, b#6]\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded tests in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJira : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15453\n\nExtracting sort ordering information in `FileSourceScanExec` so that planner can make use of it. My motivation to make this change was to get Sort Merge join in par with Hive's Sort-Merge-Bucket join when the source tables are bucketed + sorted.\n\nQuery:\n\n```\nval df = (0 until 16).map(i => (i % 8, i * 2, i.toString)).toDF(\"i\", \"j\", \"k\").coalesce(1)\ndf.write.bucketBy(8, \"j\", \"k\").sortBy(\"j\", \"k\").saveAsTable(\"table8\")\ndf.write.bucketBy(8, \"j\", \"k\").sortBy(\"j\", \"k\").saveAsTable(\"table9\")\ncontext.sql(\"SELECT * FROM table8 a JOIN table9 b ON a.j=b.j AND a.k=b.k\").explain(true)\n```\n\nBefore:\n\n```\n== Physical Plan ==\n*SortMergeJoin [j#120, k#121], [j#123, k#124], Inner\n:- *Sort [j#120 ASC, k#121 ASC], false, 0\n:  +- *Project [i#119, j#120, k#121]\n:     +- *Filter (isnotnull(k#121) && isnotnull(j#120))\n:        +- *FileScan orc default.table8[i#119,j#120,k#121] Batched: false, Format: ORC, InputPaths: file:/Users/tejasp/Desktop/dev/tp-spark/spark-warehouse/table8, PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(k), IsNotNull(j)], ReadSchema: struct<i:int,j:int,k:string>\n+- *Sort [j#123 ASC, k#124 ASC], false, 0\n+- *Project [i#122, j#123, k#124]\n+- *Filter (isnotnull(k#124) && isnotnull(j#123))\n +- *FileScan orc default.table9[i#122,j#123,k#124] Batched: false, Format: ORC, InputPaths: file:/Users/tejasp/Desktop/dev/tp-spark/spark-warehouse/table9, PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(k), IsNotNull(j)], ReadSchema: struct<i:int,j:int,k:string>\n```\n\nAfter:  (note that the `Sort` step is no longer there)\n\n```\n== Physical Plan ==\n*SortMergeJoin [j#49, k#50], [j#52, k#53], Inner\n:- *Project [i#48, j#49, k#50]\n:  +- *Filter (isnotnull(k#50) && isnotnull(j#49))\n:     +- *FileScan orc default.table8[i#48,j#49,k#50] Batched: false, Format: ORC, InputPaths: file:/Users/tejasp/Desktop/dev/tp-spark/spark-warehouse/table8, PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(k), IsNotNull(j)], ReadSchema: struct<i:int,j:int,k:string>\n+- *Project [i#51, j#52, k#53]\n   +- *Filter (isnotnull(j#52) && isnotnull(k#53))\n      +- *FileScan orc default.table9[i#51,j#52,k#53] Batched: false, Format: ORC, InputPaths: file:/Users/tejasp/Desktop/dev/tp-spark/spark-warehouse/table9, PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(j), IsNotNull(k)], ReadSchema: struct<i:int,j:int,k:string>\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a test case in `JoinSuite`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds the build automation on Windows with [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) CI tool. \n\nCurrently, this only runs the tests for SparkR as we have been having some issues with testing Windows-specific PRs (e.g. https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14743 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13165) and hard time to verify this.\n\nOne concern is, this build is dependent on [steveloughran/winutils](https://github.com/steveloughran/winutils) for pre-built Hadoop bin package (who is a Hadoop PMC member).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually, https://ci.appveyor.com/project/HyukjinKwon/spark/build/88-SPARK-17200-build-profile\nThis takes roughly 40 mins.\n\n~~Some tests are already being failed and this was found in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14743#issuecomment-241405287~~. Fixed in [SPARK-17339](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17339)\n","created_at":"2016-08-29T09:08:31Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:39:36Z","closed_at":"2016-09-08T15:29:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9f638cbd6660a3ed5f6874b1d417859069a5509e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14859/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14859/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14859/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9c06b92f7ec01442c5ba0076ccf32ba91b847b3d","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-17200-build","ref":"SPARK-17200-build","sha":"9c06b92f7ec01442c5ba0076ccf32ba91b847b3d","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

in these cases, Bucketizer should\nreserve one extra bucket for NaN values, instead of throwing an illegal exception.\nBefore:\n\n```\nBucketizer.transform on NaN value threw an illegal exception.\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```\nNaN values will be grouped in an extra bucket.\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNew test cases added in `BucketizerSuite`.\nSigned-off-by: VinceShieh

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch introduces a new internal implementation of `RDD.take()` which halts the Spark job as soon as enough rows have been received. This can offer substantial performance improvements for interactive queries. For example, consider\n\n```\nsc.parallelize(1 to 100000, 100000).filter(_ > 10000).take(1)\n```\n\nIn the current `take()` implementation, this will end up computing almost every partition of the RDD even though only the first 10% of partitions must be computed to return the desired output. With this patch's changes, Spark will cancel the running job as soon as enough output has been received, greatly improving responsiveness for limit queries with highly-selective filters.\n\nAlthough the changes here are implemented in Spark core, they also benefit Spark SQL; the following query also observes similar speedups:\n\n```\nsc.parallelize(1 to 100000, 100000).toDF.filter(\"value > 10000\").take(1)\n```\n\n**Caveat:** the performance optimizations implemented here do not apply to `AsyncRDDActions.takeAsync()`. The `takeAsync()` codepath is fairly complicated and, to the best of my knowledge, is not very widely used, so I'd like to postpone any changes to it.\n### Implementation details\n\n**Task result buffering:** this new implementation of `take()` returns exactly the same answers as the old implementation. The old implementation first collected the per-partition results from all partitions and then processed them in ascending order of partition id. In order to match this behavior, the new implementation buffers task outputs in order to process them in order.\n\n**Scheduler changes:** the existing `FutureAction.cancel()` method causes the Spark scheduler to mark the task as failed, which doesn't make sense in this context. To address this, this patch modifies the DAGScheduler to allow jobs to be cancelled while still marking them as successful. This is a slightly tricky change that will require discussion and more tests (to be added here).\n### Feature flags\n\nI have made this new implementation the default but have preserved the old `take()` implementations behind feature-flags.\n\nIn Spark Core, the old `take()` implementation can be restored by setting `spark.driver.adaptiveTakeEnabled=false` in SparkConf.\n\nIn Spark SQL, the old implementation can be used by setting `spark.sql.adaptiveTake.enabled=false` in SQLConf.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n**Manual tests:**\n- Ensure that the console progress bar disappears after the job halts early:\n  \n  ```\n   sc.parallelize(1 to 100000, 100000).toDF.filter(\"value > 10000\").rdd.map(_ => Thread.sleep(1)).take(1)\n  ```\n- Ensure that the driver thread (the thread which calls `take()`) is interrupted / unblocked in case the user cancels the active `take()` job via the web UI or via a job group.\n\n**Automated tests:**\n- Ensure that a `take()` command whose Spark tasks fail with exceptions still causes the right exceptions to be surfaced to the driver.\n- DAGSchedulerSuite test for the new \"cancel without failing job\" scheduler functionality.\n","created_at":"2016-08-28T19:25:25Z","updated_at":"2016-11-19T00:58:54Z","closed_at":"2016-09-02T19:49:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7cfd79104092c2d9418beb29c1c9ecfdabcf8301","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14854/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14854/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14854/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/32c395966ed085371af025dc44d690280c726ea9","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:take-early-stopping","ref":"take-early-stopping","sha":"32c395966ed085371af025dc44d690280c726ea9","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIf `ScalaUDF` throws exceptions during executing user code, sometimes it's hard for users to figure out what's wrong, especially when they use Spark shell. An example\n\n```\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 12 in stage 325.0 failed 4 times, most recent failure: Lost task 12.3 in stage 325.0 (TID 35622, 10.0.207.202): java.lang.NullPointerException\n    at line8414e872fb8b42aba390efc153d1611a12.$read$$iwC$$iwC$$iwC$$iwC$$anonfun$2.apply(<console>:40)\n    at line8414e872fb8b42aba390efc153d1611a12.$read$$iwC$$iwC$$iwC$$iwC$$anonfun$2.apply(<console>:40)\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$GeneratedIterator.processNext(Unknown Source)\n...\n```\n\nWe should catch these exceptions and rethrow them with better error message, to say that the exception is happened in scala udf.\n\nThis PR also does some clean up for `ScalaUDF` and add a unit test suite for it.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nthe new test suite\n","created_at":"2016-08-27T08:12:44Z","updated_at":"2016-12-14T12:33:29Z","closed_at":"2016-09-06T02:38:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"deccbcd50b313b52bae52153d66356cd36bf9eb2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14850/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14850/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14850/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bf786e6d0846e45adabc78d980cfd1c2d03dcce2","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:npe","ref":"npe","sha":"bf786e6d0846e45adabc78d980cfd1c2d03dcce2","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis is motivated by:\n\nFrom https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12778890/BucketedTables.pdf:\n\nFor some data which are sorted such as bucketed table with SORT BY, the filtering on it can be stopped early if the filtering condition satisfies some requirements. For example, the filtering like “WHERE id < 10” can be stopped as soon as the first row on which the id column is with values equal to or more than 10 is seen.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJira : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17271\n\nPlanner is adding un-needed SORT operation due to bug in the way comparison for `SortOrder` is done at https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/exchange/EnsureRequirements.scala#L253 \n`SortOrder` needs to be compared semantically because `Expression` within two `SortOrder` can be \"semantically equal\" but not literally equal objects.\n\neg. In case of `sql(\"SELECT * FROM table1 a JOIN table2 b ON a.col1=b.col1\")`\n\nExpression in required SortOrder:\n\n```\n      AttributeReference(\n        name = \"col1\",\n        dataType = LongType,\n        nullable = false\n      ) (exprId = exprId,\n        qualifier = Some(\"a\")\n      )\n```\n\nExpression in child SortOrder:\n\n```\n      AttributeReference(\n        name = \"col1\",\n        dataType = LongType,\n        nullable = false\n      ) (exprId = exprId)\n```\n\nNotice that the output column has a qualifier but the child attribute does not but the inherent expression is the same and hence in this case we can say that the child satisfies the required sort order.\n\nThis PR includes following changes:\n- Added a `semanticEquals` method to `SortOrder` so that it can compare underlying child expressions semantically (and not using default Object.equals)\n- Fixed `EnsureRequirements` to use semantic comparison of SortOrder\n## How was this patch tested?\n- Added a test case to `PlannerSuite`. Ran rest tests in `PlannerSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-08-27T03:14:21Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T11:26:59Z","closed_at":"2016-08-28T17:17:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"97ea31f74fc88892367f89c450ad40c213295a58","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14841/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14841/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14841/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7192418b3a26a14642fc04fc92bf496a954ffa5d","head":{"label":"tejasapatil:SPARK-17271_sort_order_equals_bug","ref":"SPARK-17271_sort_order_equals_bug","sha":"7192418b3a26a14642fc04fc92bf496a954ffa5d","user":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50031489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDAzMTQ4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"tejasapatil/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWith the new History Server the summary page loads the application list via the the REST API, this makes it very slow to impossible to load with large (10K+) application history. This pr fixes this by adding the `spark.history.ui.maxApplications` conf to limit the number of applications the History Server displays. This is accomplished using a new optional `limit` param for the `applications` api. (Note this only applies to what the summary page displays, all the Application UI's are still accessible if the user knows the App ID and goes to the Application UI directly.) \n\nI've also added a new test for the `limit` param in `HistoryServerSuite.scala` \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual testing and dev/run-tests\n","created_at":"2016-08-26T21:07:56Z","updated_at":"2016-08-30T21:42:54Z","closed_at":"2016-08-30T21:36:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"002ebbf48466696391126c78dd4fe971a7c94487","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14835/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14835/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14835/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8da22e30415a6f6baa536002f137eb0862a52d44","head":{"label":"ajbozarth:spark17243","ref":"spark17243","sha":"8da22e30415a6f6baa536002f137eb0862a52d44","user":{"login":"ajbozarth","id":13952758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTUyNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13952758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbozarth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":41503793,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTUwMzc5Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"ajbozarth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ajbozarth","id":13952758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTUyNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13952758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbozarth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ajbozarth/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nMerge `MultinomialLogisticRegression` into `LogisticRegression` and remove `MultinomialLogisticRegression`.\n\nMarked as WIP because we should discuss the coefficients API in the model. See discussion below.\n\nJIRA: [SPARK-17163](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17163)\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nMerged test suites and added some new unit tests.\n## Design\n### Switching between binomial and multinomial\n\nWe default to automatically detecting whether we should run binomial or multinomial lor. We expose a new parameter called `family` which defaults to auto. When \"auto\" is used, we run normal binomial lor with pivoting if there are 1 or 2 label classes. Otherwise, we run multinomial. If the user explicitly sets the family, then we abide by that setting. In the case where \"binomial\" is set but multiclass lor is detected, we throw an error.\n### coefficients/intercept model API (TODO)\n\nThis is the biggest design point remaining, IMO. We need to decide how to store the coefficients and intercepts in the model, and in turn how to expose them via the API. Two important points:\n- We must maintain compatibility with the old API, i.e. we must expose `def coefficients: Vector` and `def intercept: Double`\n- There are two separate cases: binomial lr where we have a single set of coefficients and a single intercept and multinomial lr where we have `numClasses` sets of coefficients and `numClasses` intercepts.\n\nSome options:\n1. **Store the binomial coefficients as a `2 x numFeatures` matrix.** This means that we would center the model coefficients before storing them in the model. The BLOR algorithm gives `1 * numFeatures` coefficients, but we would convert them to `2 x numFeatures` coefficients before storing them, effectively doubling the storage in the model. This has the advantage that we can make the code cleaner (i.e. less `if (isMultinomial) ... else ...`) and we don't have to reason about the different cases as much. It has the disadvantage that we double the storage space and we could see small regressions at prediction time since there are 2x the number of operations in the prediction algorithms. Additionally, we still have to produce the uncentered coefficients/intercept via the API, so we will have to either ALSO store the uncentered version, or compute it in `def coefficients: Vector` every time.\n2. **Store the binomial coefficients as a `1 x numFeatures` matrix.** We still store the coefficients as a matrix and the intercepts as a vector. When users call `coefficients` we return them a `Vector` that is backed by the same underlying array as the `coefficientMatrix`, so we don't duplicate any data. At prediction time, we use the old prediction methods that are specialized for binary LOR. The benefits here are that we don't store extra data, and we won't see any regressions in performance. The cost of this is that we have separate implementations for predict methods in the binary vs multiclass case. The duplicated code is really not very high, but it's still a bit messy. \n\nIf we do decide to store the 2x coefficients, we would likely want to see some performance tests to understand the potential regressions.\n\n**Update:** We have chosen option 2\n### Threshold/thresholds (TODO)\n\nCurrently, when `threshold` is set we clear whatever value is in `thresholds` and when `thresholds` is set we clear whatever value is in `threshold`. [SPARK-11543](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-11543) was created to prefer thresholds over threshold. We should decide if we should implement this behavior now or if we want to do it in a separate JIRA.\n\n**Update:** Let's leave it for a follow up PR\n## Follow up\n- Summary model for multiclass logistic regression [SPARK-17139](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17139)\n- Thresholds vs threshold

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds the ability to parse SQL (hexadecimal) binary literals (AKA bit strings). It follows the following syntax `X'[Hexadecimal Characters]+'`, for example: `X'01AB'` would create a binary the following binary array `0x01AB`.\n\nIf an uneven number of hexadecimal characters is passed, then the upper 4 bits of the initial byte are kept empty, and the lower 4 bits are filled using the first character. For example `X'1C7'` would create the following binary array `0x01C7`.\n\nBinary data (Array[Byte]) does not have a proper `hashCode` and `equals` functions. This meant that comparing `Literal`s containing binary data was a pain. I have updated Literal.hashCode and Literal.equals to deal properly with binary data.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded tests to the `ExpressionParserSuite`, `SQLQueryTestSuite` and `ExpressionSQLBuilderSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-08-26T14:43:33Z","updated_at":"2016-09-01T19:04:06Z","closed_at":"2016-09-01T19:04:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9964540c67c668967dc02ae1f471c245b2a37dc7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14832/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14832/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14832/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4f2b272c2c2a05a73b6646a45af811e66be5f98e","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-17263","ref":"SPARK-17263","sha":"4f2b272c2c2a05a73b6646a45af811e66be5f98e","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nUse \n- getClass.getClassLoader instead of Thread.getCurrentThread.getContextClassLoader \n- Utils.getSparkClassLoader instead of Utils.getContextOrSparkClassLoader\n\nto avoid situations where a thread from a thread pool does not have Spark jars in its class loader.\n\nWhen Spark queries are run inside Futures using **scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global** the threads offered by ForkJoinPool are occasionally not ones that have loaded Spark and despite class path definitions they might be missing Spark jars in their class loaders.\n\nIn our application we return Spark queries inside Futures. The query would sometimes fail as a result of packages missing from the thread's context class loader. There is no single point of failure. Changing the query does not help. If the jars are missing from the thread's class loader the first attempt to call ClassLoader.loadClass would crash the driver.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTests were run (./dev/run-tests) and the Spark driver in our application is now stable. Previously the Spark driver would crash often due to missing jars in class loader. All queries are returned wrapped inside futures.\n","created_at":"2016-08-26T12:22:21Z","updated_at":"2016-08-29T06:34:35Z","closed_at":"2016-08-29T06:34:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ab92f8ef9b1e6aff255c089fb8173aec60c0751e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14831/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14831/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14831/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/22baddea6a33f1510b3fc2762a14004398af22ac","head":{"label":"jukkavisma:SPARK-17255","ref":"SPARK-17255","sha":"22baddea6a33f1510b3fc2762a14004398af22ac","user":{"login":"jukkavisma","id":16664783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjY0Nzgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16664783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jukkavisma","html_url":"https://github.com/jukkavisma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jukkavisma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jukkavisma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jukkavisma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jukkavisma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jukkavisma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jukkavisma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jukkavisma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jukkavisma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jukkavisma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"341e0e778dff8c404b47d34ee7661b658bb91880","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR enables the tests for `TimestampType` for JSON and unifies the logics for verifying schema when writing in CSV. \n\nIn more details, this PR,\n- Enables the tests for `TimestampType` for JSON and\n  \n  This was disabled due to an issue in `DatatypeConverter.parseDateTime` which parses dates incorrectly, for example as below:\n  \n  ``` scala\n  val d = javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter.parseDateTime(\"0900-01-01T00:00:00.000\").getTime\n  println(d.toString)\n  ```\n  \n  ```\n  Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 KST 899\n  ```\n  \n  However, since we use `FastDateFormat`, it seems we are safe now.\n  \n  ``` scala\n  val d = FastDateFormat.getInstance(\"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS\").parse(\"0900-01-01T00:00:00.000\")\n  println(d)\n  ```\n  \n  ```\n  Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 PST 900\n  ```\n- Verifies all unsupported types in CSV\n  \n  There is a separate logics to verify the schemas in `CSVFileFormat`. This is actually not quite correct enough because we don't support `NullType` and `CalanderIntervalType` as well `StructType`, `ArrayType`, `MapType`. So, this PR adds both types.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTests in `JsonHadoopFsRelation` and `CSVSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-08-26T11:25:53Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:43:00Z","closed_at":"2016-08-26T15:31:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3237c13f0fa45c8503c209ee261670a880111104","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14829/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14829/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14829/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1baacf2697c4230d9e3b4ab4d2f05468811f0d94","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-16216-followup","ref":"SPARK-16216-followup","sha":"1baacf2697c4230d9e3b4ab4d2f05468811f0d94","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

The difference between the two confuses most users. This PR unifies the parsing behavior and also parses scientific decimal literals as decimals.\n\nThis implications in tests are limited to a single Hive compatibility test.\n## How was this patch
