https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-10231\r\nProblem:\r\nThe function executed on a server can throw FunctionException by the contract. Geode servers are logging all exceptions with stack trace to warn/error log level and respond error back to the client. But huge number of FunctionException thrown from user functions logged in geode server can affect performance, use disc space for the logs storage, and can complicate the analysis of log files.\r\n\r\nSolution 1:\r\nThe improvement for server side logging is adding system property configuration for surprising FunctionException logging. With enabled property, all FunctionException caused by user functions will be logged to debug log level.\r\n\r\nSystem property for suppressing FunctionException logging:\r\ngemfire.logging.suppressFunctionExceptionLogging=true\r\n\r\nSolution 2:\r\nAdd Log4j markers for all FunctionException logs to be able to handle them by Log4j filter configuration, eg. disable all function exception logs:\r\n`<MarkerFilter marker=\"FUNCTION_EXCEPTION_MARKER\" onMatch=\"DENY\" onMismatch=\"NEUTRAL\"/>`\r\n\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Now, with the addition of versioning and synchronization at the\r\n  higher-level methods, all the synchronization can be removed from the\r\n  small, helper methods we have.\r\n- We still need to ensure that there is synchronization between toData\r\n  and within methods that are mutating the list.\r\n- Inline various helper methods in RedisList as they are not adding any\r\n  value.\r\n- Use AvailablePortHelper to set up the port that the crashing VM will\r\n  use. Without this there is interference from other tests when running\r\n  multiple tests concurrently (in the stressTest job).\r\n- Ran at least 1000 iterations of all list-related DUnit tests without\r\n  any failures.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken: \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

run on JDK 17, numerous acceptance tests fail because a launched\nlocator or server requires access to the following packages:\n- java.base/sun.nio.ch\n- java.management/com.sun.jmx.remote.security\n\nSOLUTION\n\n- Add a `MemberJvmOptions` class that reports the JDK-dependent options\n  required to launch a locator or server on the current process's JDK.\n- Change `StartLocatorCommand` and `StartServerCommand` to add those\n  options to the command line when launching locators and servers.\n\nFUTURE\n\nFuture PRs will likely put these opens/exports in an argument file, then\nconfigure these commands to use the argument file. We are deferring that\nuntil we identify additional needs for the argument file, so we can\nchoose an appropriate location for the argument file.\n\nCo-authored-by: Dale Emery

that use GfshRule leave behind orphaned processes and do not save artifacts for debugging failures.\r\n\r\nThese issues made it impossible to make any progress towards debugging of Java 17 failures.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION\r\n\r\nGfshRule needs to cleanup all processes it forks. It also needs to save off all runtime artifacts such as logging, stats, pid files, diskstores to enable debugging of test failures.\r\n\r\nDETAILS\r\n\r\nOverhaul GfshRule and all tests using it for proper debugging and to prevent test pollution.\r\n\r\nGfshRule\r\n* kill ALL geode processes during cleanup\r\n* use FolderRule to ensure all logs and files are properly saved off when a test fails\r\n* extract GfshExecutor from JUnit rule code\r\n* GfshExecutor allows a test to use any number of Geode versions with just one GfshRule\r\n* add Gfsh log level support for easier debugging\r\n* add support for new VmConfiguration to allow control over Geode and Java versions\r\n* overhaul API of GfshRule and companion classes for better consistency and design\r\n\r\nFolderRule\r\n* replaces TemporaryFolder and saves off all content when a test fails\r\n* creates root directory under the gradle worker instead of under temp\r\n\r\nUpdate HTTP session caching module tests:\r\n* use new FolderRule to save all artifacts when a test fails\r\n* use nio Paths for filesystem variables\r\n\r\nUpdate acceptance and upgrade tests that use GfshRule:\r\n* use new improved GfshRule and GfshExecutor\r\n* use new FolderRule instead of TemporaryFolder to save all artifacts when a test fails\r\n* use --disable-default-server in tests with no clients\r\n* fix flakiness of many tests by using random ports instead of default or hardcoded port values\r\n* reformat GfshRule API usage in tests to improve readability and consistency\r\n* add GfshStopper to provide common place to await process stop (stop locator/server is async so restarting with same ports is very prone to hitting BindExceptions)\r\n\r\nUpdate ProcessUtils:\r\n* extract NativeProcessUtils and make it public for direct use\r\n* rename InternalProcessUtils as ProcessUtilsProvider and move to its own class\r\n* rethrow IOExceptions as UncheckedIOExceptions\r\n* fix flakiness in NativeProcessUtilsTest by moving findAvailablePid into test method\r\n\r\nMinor changes:\r\n* improve code formatting and readability\r\n* convert from old io File to nio Path APIs as much as possible\r\n* close output streams to fix filesystem issues on Windows\r\n\r\nFixes flaky test tickets:\r\n* DeployJarAcceptanceTest [GEODE-9615](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-9615)\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\nThe jdk8, jdk17 and windows labels were used to run tests on more environments.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains mostly test and framework changes. The only product code altered is ServerLauncher and several classes in org.apache.geode.internal.process, all of which is in

Both of these commands have the ability to create events to satisfy\r\n  BLPOP.\r\n- Introduce a NotificationEvent enum which is passed to fireEvent.\r\n- Previously the RedisCommandType was being passed, but this does not\r\n  work for RENAME which creates RENAME_FROM and RENAME_TO events. In the\r\n  future, other commands will need to create multiple events too.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken: \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

described in RFC, when several gateway receivers have the same value for VIP:PORT, since we have same VIP:PORT for all destinations, theoretically only one connection could be used for pinging destinations. But since all ping tasks are triggered  in parallel, generally each task will request same connection at the same time, and we will create new connection for each task.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, proposal is to introduce configurable option to gradually activate pinging toward destination. This can be accomplish by increasing initial delay of each ping task, when endpoint is registering to be in use. So when initially creating ping tasks, we will set initial start of each task at different time.\r\n\r\nFor example if we have 5 destinations, and we set ping interval of 5 secs, and initial delay of 0.5 secs, result would be:\r\n\r\n1st ping task will start after 5 secs\r\n2nd ping task will start after 5.5 secs\r\n3rd ping task will start after 6 secs\r\n4th ping task will start after 6.5 secs\r\n5th ping task will start after 7 secs\r\n\r\nAfter initial delay, existing logic is kept, to trigger new ping after ping interval of 5 secs.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken: \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [*] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

default implementation of `Function.getId()` returns the canonical\nname of the function's class. But:\n- On all JDKs, an anonymous class has no canonical name.\n- Starting with JDK 15, a hidden class (such as the class of a lambda\n  expression) has no canonical name.\n\nGiven that `Function` is annotated as a functional interface, it is\nproblematic that its default `getId()` returns `null` for functions\ncreated as anonymous classes and (on JDK 15+) via lambda expressions.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nChange `Function.getId()` to return its class's name if the class has no\ncanonical
