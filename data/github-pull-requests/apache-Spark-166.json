What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes a behavior of `SHOW CREATE TABLE` added in `SPARK-33898` (#32931) to output deterministic result.\r\nA test `SPARK-33898: SHOW CREATE TABLE` in `DataSourceV2SQLSuite` compares two `CREATE TABLE` statements. One is generated by `SHOW CREATE TABLE` against a created table and the other is expected `CREATE TABLE` statement.\r\n\r\nThe created table has options `from` and `to`, and they are declared in this order.\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE $t (\r\n  a bigint NOT NULL,\r\n  b bigint,\r\n  c bigint,\r\n  `extra col` ARRAY<INT>,\r\n  `<another>` STRUCT<x: INT, y: ARRAY<BOOLEAN>>\r\n)\r\nUSING foo\r\nOPTIONS (\r\n  from = 0,\r\n  to = 1)\r\nCOMMENT 'This is a comment'\r\nTBLPROPERTIES ('prop1' = '1')\r\nPARTITIONED BY (a)\r\nLOCATION '/tmp'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the expected `CREATE TABLE` in the test code is like as follows.\r\n```\r\n\"CREATE TABLE testcat.ns1.ns2.tbl (\",\r\n\"`a` BIGINT NOT NULL,\",\r\n\"`b` BIGINT,\",\r\n\"`c` BIGINT,\",\r\n\"`extra col` ARRAY<INT>,\",\r\n\"`<another>` STRUCT<`x`: INT, `y`: ARRAY<BOOLEAN>>)\",\r\n\"USING foo\",\r\n\"OPTIONS(\",\r\n\"'from' = '0',\",\r\n\"'to' = '1')\",\r\n\"PARTITIONED BY (a)\",\r\n\"COMMENT 'This is a comment'\",\r\n\"LOCATION '/tmp'\",\r\n\"TBLPROPERTIES(\",\r\n\"'prop1' = '1')\"\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, the order of `from` and `to` is expected.\r\nBut options are implemented as `Map` so the order of key cannot be kept.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this test fails with Scala 2.13.\r\n```\r\n[info] - SPARK-33898: SHOW CREATE TABLE *** FAILED *** (515 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   Array(\"CREATE TABLE testcat.ns1.ns2.tbl (\", \"`a` BIGINT NOT NULL,\", \"`b` BIGINT,\", \"`c` BIGINT,\", \"`extra col` ARRAY<INT>,\", \"`<another>` STRUCT<`x`: INT, `y`: ARRAY<BOOLEAN>>)\", \"USING foo\", \"OPTIONS(\", \"'to' = '1',\", \"'from' = '0')\", \"PARTITIONED BY (a)\", \"COMMENT 'This is a comment'\", \"LOCATION '/tmp'\", \"TBLPROPERTIES(\", \"'prop1' = '1')\") did not equal Array(\"CREATE TABLE testcat.ns1.ns2.tbl (\", \"`a` BIGINT NOT NULL,\", \"`b` BIGINT,\", \"`c` BIGINT,\", \"`extra col` ARRAY<INT>,\", \"`<another>` STRUCT<`x`: INT, `y`: ARRAY<BOOLEAN>>)\", \"USING foo\", \"OPTIONS(\", \"'from' = '0',\", \"'to' = '1')\", \"PARTITIONED BY (a)\", \"COMMENT 'This is a comment'\", \"LOCATION '/tmp'\", \"TBLPROPERTIES(\", \"'prop1' = '1')\") (DataSourceV2SQLSuite.scala:1997)\r\n```\r\nIn the current master, the test doesn't fail with Scala 2.12 but it's still non-deterministic.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe current implement of `TimeWindow` only supports `TimestampType`. Spark added a new type `TimestampNTZType`, so we should support `TimestampNTZType` in expression `TimeWindow`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n `TimestampNTZType` similar to `TimestampType`, we should support `TimestampNTZType` in expression `TimeWindow`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'Yes'.\r\n`TimeWindow` will accepts

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a follow-up to #29855 according to the [comments](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29855/files#r505536514)\r\nIn this PR, the following changes are made:\r\n\r\n1. A new `BlockPushingListener` interface is created specifically for block push. The existing `BlockFetchingListener` interface is left as is, since it might be used by external shuffle solutions. These 2 interfaces are unified under `BlockTransferListener` to enable code reuse.\r\n2. `RetryingBlockFetcher`, `BlockFetchStarter`, and `RetryingBlockFetchListener` are renamed to `RetryingBlockTransferor`, `BlockTransferStarter`, and `RetryingBlockTransferListener` respectively. This makes their names more generic to be reused across both block fetch and push.\r\n3. Comments in `OneForOneBlockPusher` are further clarified to better explain how we handle retries for block push.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make code cleaner without sacrificing backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-14T06:27:47Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T22:41:55Z","closed_at":"2021-07-26T22:40:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"123043b59fffee50d167737572d32978ac1f0d5d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33340/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33340/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33340/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9c418f4e7963df5f8368d31b780681c4b1f2d5f9","head":{"label":"linkedin:SPARK-32915-followup","ref":"SPARK-32915-followup","sha":"9c418f4e7963df5f8368d31b780681c4b1f2d5f9","user":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":285879539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU4Nzk1Mzk=","name":"spark","full_name":"linkedin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd the name check when initialize a catalog by name. Keep consistent with the namespace/table naming rule.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen I try to add the command `SHOW CATALOGS`, I found catalog names are meaningless in some cases. eg:\r\n1. if the catalog name is `\"\"`, `\" \"`, `\"  \"` that contains some spaces and so on. I think it doesn't make sense\r\n2. if the catalog name is `\"a.b\"` that contains `.`, I'm more confused. `b` is the name of a namespace or part of catalog name?\r\n\r\n[#WISH#SPARK-36133](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36133)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRefactor `ParquetColumnIndexSuite` and allow better code reuse.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nA few methods in the test suite can share the same utility method `checkUnalignedPages` so it's better to do that and remove code duplication.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, `parquet.enable.dictionary` is tested for both `true` and `false` combination.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplement non-equality comparison operators between two Categoricals.\r\nNon-goal: supporting Scalar input will be a follow-up task.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\npandas supports non-equality comparisons between two Categoricals. We should follow that.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. No `NotImplementedError` for `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` operators between two Categoricals. An example is shown as below:\r\n\r\nFrom:\r\n```py\r\n>>> import pyspark.pandas as ps\r\n>>> from pandas.api.types import CategoricalDtype\r\n>>> psser = ps.Series([1, 2, 3]).astype(CategoricalDtype([3, 2, 1], ordered=True))\r\n>>> other_psser = ps.Series([2, 1, 3]).astype(CategoricalDtype([3, 2, 1], ordered=True))\r\n>>> with ps.option_context(\"compute.ops_on_diff_frames\", True):\r\n...     psser <= other_psser\r\n... \r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nNotImplementedError: <= can not be applied to categoricals.\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo:\r\n```py\r\n>>> import pyspark.pandas as ps\r\n>>> from pandas.api.types import CategoricalDtype\r\n>>> psser = ps.Series([1, 2, 3]).astype(CategoricalDtype([3, 2, 1], ordered=True))\r\n>>> other_psser = ps.Series([2, 1, 3]).astype(CategoricalDtype([3, 2, 1], ordered=True))\r\n>>> with ps.option_context(\"compute.ops_on_diff_frames\", True):\r\n...     psser <= other_psser\r\n... \r\n0    False\r\n1     True\r\n2     True\r\ndtype: bool\r\n```\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFix the skipping values logic in Parquet vectorized reader when column index is effective, by considering nulls and only call `ParquetVectorUpdater.skipValues` when the values are non-null.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Parquet vectorized reader may not work correctly if column index filtering is effective, and the data page contains null values. For instance, let's say we have two columns `c1: BIGINT` and `c2: STRING`, and the following pages:\r\n```\r\n   * c1        500       500       500       500\r\n   *  |---------|---------|---------|---------|\r\n   *  |-------|-----|-----|---|---|---|---|---|\r\n   * c2     400   300   300 200 200 200 200 200\r\n```\r\n\r\nand suppose we have a query like the following:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM t WHERE c1 = 500\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis will create a Parquet row range `[500, 1000)` which, when applied to `c2`, will require us to skip all the rows in `[400,500)`. However the current logic for skipping rows is via `updater.skipValues(n, valueReader)` which is incorrect since this skips the next `n` non-null values. In the case when nulls are present, this will not work correctly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a new test in `ParquetColumnIndexSuite`.","created_at":"2021-07-13T22:48:05Z","updated_at":"2021-07-14T15:04:17Z","closed_at":"2021-07-14T10:14:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a03cbba99dbbd64a1721541f9a99fc4af62dc9f7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33330/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33330/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33330/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cfd73a73ec60eb8b44823baf60f422377e9bced9","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-36123-skip-nulls","ref":"SPARK-36123-skip-nulls","sha":"cfd73a73ec60eb8b44823baf60f422377e9bced9","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

is WIP because #33118 (comment)\r\n\r\nWhat changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPush-based shuffle is partially merged in apache master but some of the tasks are still incomplete. Since 3.2 is going to cut soon, we will not be able to get the pending tasks reviewed and merged. Few of the pending tasks make protocol changes to the push-based shuffle protocols, so we would like to prevent users from enabling push-based shuffle both on the client and the server until push-based shuffle implementation is complete.\r\nWe can prevent push-based shuffle to be used by throwing UnsupportedOperationException both on the client and the server when the user tries to enable it.\r\n\r\nWhy are the changes needed?\r\nThe change is needed to prevent users from trying out push-based shuffle until it is complete.\r\n\r\nDoes this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. It will prevent users to try out push-based shuffle until it is complete.\r\n\r\nHow was this patch tested?\r\nIt is a straightforward change that prevents users from enable push-based shuffle so haven't added a UT for it.","created_at":"2021-07-13T18:12:03Z","updated_at":"2021-09-20T17:07:24Z","closed_at":"2021-09-20T17:07:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1685104c4d966692fe9ba99152a4a77c6e8d2993","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33329/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33329/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33329/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c6cb54ed13c28e6e5cb8dbbeb987737a26437573","head":{"label":"linkedin:SPARK-35917","ref":"SPARK-35917","sha":"c6cb54ed13c28e6e5cb8dbbeb987737a26437573","user":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":285879539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU4Nzk1Mzk=","name":"spark","full_name":"linkedin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFor non-datasource Hive tables, e.g. tables written outside of Spark (through Hive or Trino), we have certain optimzations in Spark where we use Spark ORC and Parquet datasources to read these tables ([Ref](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/fbf53dee37129a493a4e5d5a007625b35f44fbda/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/HiveMetastoreCatalog.scala#L128)) rather than using the Hive serde.\r\nIf such a table contains a `path` property, Spark will try to list this path property in addition to the table location when creating an `InMemoryFileIndex`. ([Ref](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/fbf53dee37129a493a4e5d5a007625b35f44fbda/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/DataSource.scala#L575)) This can lead to wrong data if `path` property points to a directory location or an error if `path` is not a location. A concrete example is provided in [SPARK-28266 (comment)](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28266?focusedCommentId=17380170&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17380170).\r\n\r\nSince these tables were not written through Spark, Spark should not interpret this `path` property as it can be set by an external system with a different meaning.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor better compatibility with Hive tables generated by other platforms (non-Spark)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdds 3 new syntactic sugar overloads to Dataset's join method as proposed in [SPARK-35739](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35739).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImproved development experience for developers using Spark SQL, specifically when coding in Java.  \r\n\r\nPrior to changes the Seq overloads required developers to use less-known Java-to-Scala converter methods that made code less readable.  The overloads internalize those converter calls for two of the new methods and the third method adds a single-item overload that is useful for both Java and Scala.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the three new overloads technically constitute an API change to the Dataset class.  These overloads are net-new and have been commented appropriately in line with the existing methods.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest cases were not added because it is unclear to me where/how syntactic sugar overloads fit into the testing suites (if at all).  Happy to add them if I can be pointed in the correct direction.\r\n\r\n* Changes were tested in Scala via spark-shell.\r\n* Changes were tested in Java by modifying an example:\r\n  ```\r\n  diff --git a/examples/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/examples/sql/JavaSparkSQLExample.java b/examples/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/examples/sql/JavaSparkSQLExample.java\r\n  index 86a9045d8a..342810c1e6

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd new SQL function `to_timestamp_ltz`\r\nsyntax:\r\n```\r\nto_timestamp_ltz(timestamp_str_column[, fmt])\r\nto_timestamp_ltz(timestamp_column)\r\nto_timestamp_ltz(date_column)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAs the result of to_timestamp become consistent with the SQL configuration spark.sql.timestmapType and there is already a SQL function to_timestmap_ntz, we need new function to_timestamp_ltz to construct timestamp with local time zone values.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, a new function for constructing timestamp with local time zone values\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

**[WIP]** is only since solutions to the same issue is already being proposed in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33205. But the code is complete and should work as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds support for using value class in nested case classes. This has previously been proposed in the following PRs: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22309 https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27153 https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33205\r\n\r\nThe first PR had the same approach as in this one of always encoding the value class as the underlying type. But as noted by @cloud-fan: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22309#issuecomment-433913001 the implementation was quite spread out in `ScalaReflection.scala` this is addressed in this PR by \"unwrapping\" the value class only when used inside a case class. This removes the need for the extra argument `instantiateValueClass` to `deserializerFor` and makes the implementation less spread out.\r\n\r\nThe other two are both by @mickjermsurawong-stripe  and takes the approach that value class are only \"unwrapped\" is cases where there there will be no runtime object. This has the advantage of being fully backwards compatible with cases where case class currently work. The partial support for value classes was original added in: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15284\r\ndoes only add test cases for single column value classes. Therefore it seems like other cases where value classes happen to work like `Option[ValueClass]` or `Array[ValueClass]` are mostly accidental and where not thoughtfully designed to have the current behavior.\r\n\r\nThis PR is meant for discussion and alternative approach to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33205 if there is no need for schema backwards compatibility. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSupport value classes in Datasets, so that they can be used in code bases that currently use them in their modeling.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis add supports for using value class in DataFrames and Datasets that would previously led to exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe main change the can effect existing code is that previously single column value classes would be encoded as they where simple case class.\r\nTo avoid extra complexity this patch always treats value classes as their underlying type.\r\nTherefore given the following case class:\r\n```\r\ncase class MyInt(wrapped: Int) extends AnyVal\r\n```\r\nthis means that both `Dataset[Int]` and `Dataset[MyInt]` will have the same schema\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- value: integer (nullable = false)\r\n```\r\nBefore this patch the schema of `Dataset[MyInt]` would instead have been\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- wrapped: integer (nullable = false)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests in: `ScalaReflectionSuite.scala`, `ExpressionEncoderSuite.scala`, `DataFrameSuite.scala` and `DatasetSuite.scala`.","created_at":"2021-07-13T06:37:22Z","updated_at":"2021-08-02T07:07:45Z","closed_at":"2021-08-02T07:07:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7768dc0ed96f1666f4686963778a305bb7b34546","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33316/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33316/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33316/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a201f69028206d925850f2c7f3b6af9a487b3769","head":{"label":"eejbyfeldt:SPARK-20384-value-classes-always-treat-as-underlying-type","ref":"SPARK-20384-value-classes-always-treat-as-underlying-type","sha":"a201f69028206d925850f2c7f3b6af9a487b3769","user":{"login":"eejbyfeldt","id":73838248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4MjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73838248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt","html_url":"https://github.com/eejbyfeldt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":373800628,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzM4MDA2Mjg=","name":"spark","full_name":"eejbyfeldt/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eejbyfeldt","id":73838248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4MjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73838248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt","html_url":"https://github.com/eejbyfeldt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eejbyfeldt/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis unifies struct schema mismatch-handling logic between `AvroSerializer` and `AvroDeserializer`, pushing it into `AvroUtils` which is used by both. The newly unified exception-handling logic is updated to provide more contextual information in error messages. When a schema mismatch is found, previously we would only report the first missing field that is found, but there may be any others as well, which can make it less clear what exactly is going wrong. Now, we will report on all missing fields.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhile working on #31490, we discussed that there is room for improvement in how schema mismatch errors are reported ([comment1](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31490#discussion_r659970793), [comment2](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31490#issuecomment-869866848)). Additionally, the logic between `AvroSerializer` and `AvroDeserializer` was quite similar for handling these issues, but didn't share common code, causing duplication and making it harder to see exactly what differences existed between the two.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nSome error messages when matching Catalyst struct schemas against Avro record schemas now include more information.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests

This doesn't happen when it is run on command line using maven as `spark.testing` is set to true.\r\nChanges made - set `spark.testing` to true in `initPushBasedShuffleConfs`\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix to run DAGSchedulerSuite tests in ad-hoc manner\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to update the SQL migration guide, in particular the section about the migration from Spark 2.4 to 3.0. New item informs users about the following issue:\r\n\r\n**What**: Spark doesn't detect encoding (charset) in CSV files with BOM correctly. Such files can be read only in the multiLine mode when the CSV option encoding matches to the actual encoding of CSV files. For example, Spark cannot read UTF-16BE CSV files when encoding is set to UTF-8 which is the default mode. This is the case of the current ES ticket.\r\n\r\n**Why**: In previous Spark versions, encoding wasn't propagated to the underlying library that means the lib tried to detect file encoding automatically. It could success for some encodings that require BOM presents at the beginning of files. Starting from the versions 3.0, users can specify file encoding via the CSV option encoding which has UTF-8 as the default value. Spark propagates such default to the underlying library (uniVocity), and as a consequence this turned off encoding auto-detection.\r\n\r\n**When**: Since Spark 3.0. In particular, the commit https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/2df34db586bec379e40b5cf30021f5b7a2d79271 causes the issue.\r\n\r\n**Workaround**: Enabling the encoding auto-detection mechanism in uniVocity by passing null as the value of CSV option encoding. A more recommended approach is to set the encoding option explicitly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL. This should help to users in their migration from Spark 2.4.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nShould be checked by building docs in GA/jenkins.\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-12T09:45:13Z","updated_at":"2021-07-12T09:54:50Z","closed_at":"2021-07-12T09:54:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"91065069bc3568072d05a694513fe0a56c57fb5f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33300/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33300/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33300/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/848747c33b90a388449dbe6ce6ec39a7890c7ebe","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:csv-encoding-migration-guide","ref":"csv-encoding-migration-guide","sha":"848747c33b90a388449dbe6ce6ec39a7890c7ebe","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSupport new functions make_timestamp_ntz and make_timestamp_ltz\r\nSyntax:\r\n* `make_timestamp_ntz(year, month, day, hour, min, sec)`: Create local date-time from year, month, day, hour, min, sec fields\r\n* `make_timestamp_ltz(year, month, day, hour, min, sec[, timezone])`: Create current timestamp with local time zone from year, month, day, hour, min, sec and timezone fields\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAs the result of `make_timestamp` become consistent with the SQL configuration `spark.sql.timestmapType`, we need these two new functions to construct timestamp literals. They align to the functions [`make_timestamp` and `make_timestamptz`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/functions-datetime.html) in PostgreSQL\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, two new datetime functions: make_timestamp_ntz and make_timestamp_ltz.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nEnd-to-end tests.","created_at":"2021-07-12T09:37:36Z","updated_at":"2021-07-20T02:12:46Z","closed_at":"2021-07-12T19:44:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c8484939ddf32c0bd82714e6ee7496d73e00d7bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33299/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33299/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33299/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ba6421de3b1f0012dbe871cfe43b0df6f51312bc","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:make_timestamp_ntz_ltz","ref":"make_timestamp_ntz_ltz","sha":"ba6421de3b1f0012dbe871cfe43b0df6f51312bc","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nUse `BroadcastExchangeExec.executionContext` instead of `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec.executionContext` in `BroadcastExchangeExec`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`AdaptiveSparkPlanExec` shares the execution context with `BroadcastQueryStage`, but it has a small number thread (hard code 16). Unfortunately, it's not enough in some complex queries and no thread is available to cancel the broadcast stage.\r\n\r\nIn normal code path (without AQE), broadcast has it's own execution context with a config `spark.sql.broadcastExchange.maxThreadThreshold`. It should make sense to make broadcast query stage executionContext isolation from AQE and respect the existed thread threshold config.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe SQL function MAKE_TIMESTAMP should return different results based on the default timestamp type:\r\n* when \"spark.sql.timestampType\" is TIMESTAMP_NTZ, return TimestampNTZType literal\r\n* when \"spark.sql.timestampType\" is TIMESTAMP_LTZ, return TimestampType literal\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAs \"spark.sql.timestampType\" sets the default timestamp type, the make_timestamp function should behave consistently with it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, when the value of \"spark.sql.timestampType\" is TIMESTAMP_NTZ, the result type of `MAKE_TIMESTAMP` is of TIMESTAMP_NTZ type.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a new optimize rule(`BroadcastJoinOuterJoinStreamSide`) to add a BHJ ahead of SMJ for left outer/semi/anti join if stream side can build broadcast and it is much smaller that other side. A real case from our cluster:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM t1 c\r\nLEFT JOIN t2 b ON substring(b.extrnl_rfrnc_key,(instr(b.extrnl_rfrnc_key,'!')+1),char_length(b.extrnl_rfrnc_key))=c.exec_rsrc_ref_id\r\nWHERE c.prcsr_trxn_id = 3415882487483039;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this PR | After

spark.sql.optimizer.excludedRules=org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.BroadcastJoinOuterJoinStreamSide;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove query performance if left outer/semi/anti join if it's left side is very small and right side is very large.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR modifies comment for `UTF8String.trimAll` and`sql-migration-guide.mld`.\r\nThe comment for `UTF8String.trimAll` says like as follows.\r\n```\r\nTrims whitespaces ({@literal <=} ASCII 32) from both ends of this string.\r\n```\r\nSimilarly, `sql-migration-guide.md` mentions about the behavior of `cast` like as follows.\r\n```\r\nIn Spark 3.0, when casting string value to integral types(tinyint, smallint, int and bigint),\r\ndatetime types(date, timestamp and interval) and boolean type,\r\nthe leading and trailing whitespaces (<= ASCII 32) will be trimmed before converted to these type values,\r\nfor example, `cast(' 1\\t' as int)` results `1`, `cast(' 1\\t' as boolean)` results `true`,\r\n`cast('2019-10-10\\t as date)` results the date value `2019-10-10`.\r\nIn Spark version 2.4 and below, when casting string to integrals and booleans,\r\nit does not trim the whitespaces from both ends; the foregoing results is `null`,\r\nwhile to datetimes, only the trailing spaces (= ASCII 32) are removed.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SPARK-32559 (#29375) changed the behavior and only whitespace ASCII characters will be trimmed since Spark 3.0.1.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo follow the previous change.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nConfirmed the document built by the following command.\r\n```\r\nSKIP_API=1 bundle exec jekyll

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- Fixes the performance issue mentioned in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32559/files#r633488455 and partially fixed in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33142/files#r660897248 using a new option to remove expressions from equivalence maps.\r\n- Fixes a bug with identifying common expressions in conditional expressions (a side effect of the above new approach). After this PR, `add` will be common subexpression in the following example:\r\n  ```\r\n  val add = Add(Literal(1), Literal(2))\r\n  val ifExpr1 = If(Literal(true), add, Literal(3))\r\n  val ifExpr3 = If(GreaterThan(add, Literal(4)), Add(ifExpr1, add), Multiply(ifExpr1, add))\r\n  var equivalence = new EquivalentExpressions\r\n  equivalence.addExprTree(ifExpr3)\r\n  ```\r\n- Fixes a bug of transparently canonicalized expressions (like `PromotePrecision`) are considered common subexpressions.\r\n  After this PR, `transparent` will not be common subexpression in the following example:\r\n  ```\r\n  val add = Add(Literal(1), Literal(2))\r\n  val transparent = PromotePrecision(add)\r\n  var equivalence = new EquivalentExpressions\r\n  equivalence.addExprTree(transparent)\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBugfix + performance improvement.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting + new

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe SQL function TO_TIMESTAMP should return different results based on the default timestamp type:\r\n* when \"spark.sql.timestampType\" is TIMESTAMP_NTZ, return TimestampNTZType literal\r\n* when \"spark.sql.timestampType\" is TIMESTAMP_LTZ, return TimestampType literal\r\n\r\nThis PR also refactor the class GetTimestamp and GetTimestampNTZ to reduce duplicated code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAs \"spark.sql.timestampType\" sets the default timestamp type, the to_timestamp function should behave consistently with it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, when the value of \"spark.sql.timestampType\" is TIMESTAMP_NTZ, the result type of `TO_TIMESTAMP` is of TIMESTAMP_NTZ type.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have a job that has a stage that contains about 8k tasks.  Most tasks take about 1~10min to finish but 3 of them tasks run extremely slow with similar data sizes. They take about 1 hour each to finish and also do their speculations. \r\n\r\nThe root cause is most likely the delay of the storage system. But it's not straightforward enough to find where the performance issue occurs, in the phase of shuffle read, task execution, output, commitment e.t.c..\r\n\r\n```log\r\n2021-07-09 03:05:17 CST SparkHadoopMapRedUtil INFO - attempt_20210709022249_0003_m_007050_37351: Committed\r\n2021-07-09 03:05:17 CST Executor INFO - Finished task 7050.0 in stage 3.0 (TID 37351). 3311 bytes result sent to driver\r\n2021-07-09 04:06:10 CST ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator INFO - Getting 9 non-empty blocks including 0 local blocks and 9 remote blocks\r\n2021-07-09 04:06:10 CST TransportClientFactory INFO - Found inactive connection to\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that no tests in `hadoop-cloud` are compiled and run unless `hadoop-3.2` profile is activated explicitly.\r\nThe root cause seems similar to SPARK-36067 (#33276) so the solution is to activate `hadoop-3.2` profile in `hadoop-cloud/pom.xml` by default.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduced an empty profile for `hadoop-2.7`. Without this, building with `hadoop-2.7` fails.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`hadoop-3.2` profile should be activated by default so tests in `hadoop-cloud` also should be compiled and run without activating `hadoop-3.2` profile explicitly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nConfirmed tests in `hadoop-cloud` ran with both SBT and Maven.\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt -Phadoop-cloud \"hadoop-cloud/test\"\r\n...\r\n[info] CommitterBindingSuite:\r\n[info] - BindingParquetOutputCommitter binds to the inner committer (258 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - committer protocol can be serialized

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that `YarnClusterSuite` fails due to `NoClassDefFoundError unless `hadoop-3.2` profile is activated explicitly regardless of building with SBT or Maven.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt -Pyarn \"yarn/testOnly org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.YarnClusterSuite\"\r\n...\r\n[info] YarnClusterSuite:\r\n[info] org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.YarnClusterSuite *** ABORTED *** (598 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/bouncycastle/operator/OperatorCreationException\r\n[info]   at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.ResourceManager$RMActiveServices.serviceInit(ResourceManager.java:888)\r\n[info]   at org.apache.hadoop.service.AbstractService.init(AbstractService.java:164)\r\n[info]   at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.ResourceManager.createAndInitActiveServices(ResourceManager.java:1410)\r\n[info]   at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.ResourceManager.serviceInit(ResourceManager.java:344)\r\n[info]   at org.apache.hadoop.service.AbstractService.init(AbstractService.java:164)\r\n[info]   at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.MiniYARNCluster.initResourceManager(MiniYARNCluster.java:359)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe solution is modifying `yarn/pom.xml` to activate `hadoop-3.2` profiles by default.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nhadoop-3.2 profile should be enabled by default so `YarnClusterSuite` should also successfully finishes without `-Phadoop-3.2`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nRun `YarnClusterSuite` with both SBT and Maven without `-Phadoop-3.2` and it successfully finished.\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt -Pyarn

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor tests with operations on different Series, sort index of results before comparing them with pandas.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe have many tests with operations on different Series in `spark/python/pyspark/pandas/tests/data_type_ops/` that assume the result's index to be sorted and then compare to the pandas' behavior. \r\n\r\nThe assumption on the result's index ordering is wrong since Spark DataFrame join is used internally and the order is not preserved if the data being in different partitions.\r\n\r\nSo we should assume the result to be disordered and sort the index of such results before comparing them with pandas.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\nKeyword:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTry to capture the error message from the `faulthandler` when the Python worker crashes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, we just see an error message saying `\"exited unexpectedly (crashed)\"` when the UDFs causes the Python worker to crash by like segmentation fault.\r\nWe should take advantage of [`faulthandler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html) and try to capture the error message from the `faulthandler`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, when a Spark config `spark.python.worker.faulthandler.enabled` is `true`, the stack trace will be seen in the error message when the Python worker crashes.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> def f():\r\n...   import ctypes\r\n...   ctypes.string_at(0)\r\n...\r\n>>> sc.parallelize([1]).map(lambda x: f()).count()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Python worker exited

manually.\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-08T21:26:17Z","updated_at":"2021-07-09T03:09:08Z","closed_at":"2021-07-09T02:31:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"619690f333cdd04e3b690e1c795024002a7eae7f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33273/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33273/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33273/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5dd8f30b67650753d9e38e9440feb72beae159e9","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-36062/faulthandler","ref":"issues/SPARK-36062/faulthandler","sha":"5dd8f30b67650753d9e38e9440feb72beae159e9","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a new configuration flag to allow Spark to provide hints to the scheduler when we are decommissioning or exiting a pod that this pod will have the least impact for a pre-emption event.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nKubernetes added the concepts of pod disruption budgets (which can have selectors based on labels) as well pod deletion for providing hints to the scheduler as to what we would prefer to have pre-empted.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNew configuration flag\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe deletion unit test was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove the automatic build guides of documentation in `docs/README.md`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis doesn't work very well:\r\n\r\n1. It doesn't detect the changes in RST files. But PySpark internally generates RST files so we can't just simply include it in the detection. Otherwise, it goes to an infinite loop\r\n2. During PySpark documentation generation, it launches some jobs to generate plot images now. This is broken with `entr` command, and the job fails. Seems like it's related to how `entr` creates the process internally.\r\n3. Minor issue but the documentation build directory was changed (`_build` -> `build` in `python/docs`)\r\n\r\nI don't think it's worthwhile testing and fixing the docs to show an working example because dev people are already able to do it manually.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested.\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-08T11:12:57Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:53:13Z","closed_at":"2021-07-09T01:05:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ddca9cd7fdd0f43aa4542a7159ad9154ba715879","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33266/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33266/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33266/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0205a5c8e26176be48746bdf8e161d084995bb08","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-36051","ref":"SPARK-36051","sha":"0205a5c8e26176be48746bdf8e161d084995bb08","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n1. add \"closeStreams\" to FileAppender and RollingFileAppender\r\n2. set \"closeStreams\" to \"true\" in ExecutorRunner\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe executor will hang when due disk full or other exceptions which happened in writting to outputStream: the root cause is the \"inputStream\" is not closed after the error happens:\r\n1. ExecutorRunner creates two files appenders for pipe: one for stdout, one for stderr\r\n2. FileAppender.appendStreamToFile exits the loop when writing to outputStream\r\n3. FileAppender closes the outputStream, but left the inputStream which refers the pipe's stdout and stderr opened\r\n4. The executor will hang when printing the log message if the pipe is full (no one consume the outputs)\r\n5. From the driver side, you can see the task can't be completed for ever\r\n\r\nWith this fix, the step 4 will throw an exception, the driver can catch up the exception and reschedule the failed task to other executors. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSetting `kubernetes.request.retry.backoffLimit` by default to 3 when the user haven't specified  any value for it.\r\n\r\nThis way when k8s API servers gives back HTTP status code >= 500 then an exponential backoff will be triggered (where `kubernetes.request.retry.backoffInterval` is 1000ms by default).\r\n\r\nFor details please check https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/3087.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe experienced some internal K8s errors for example when the `etcdserver` leader election was ongoing the error was propagated to the API client and caused an issue in Spark:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: io.fabric8.kubernetes.client.KubernetesClientException: Failure executing: GET

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`LOCALTIMESTAMP()` is a datetime value function from ANSI SQL.\r\nThe syntax show below:\r\n```\r\n<datetime value function> ::=\r\n    <current date value function>\r\n  | <current time value function>\r\n  | <current timestamp value function>\r\n  | <current local time value function>\r\n  | <current local timestamp value function>\r\n<current date value function> ::=\r\nCURRENT_DATE\r\n<current time value function> ::=\r\nCURRENT_TIME [ <left paren> <time precision> <right paren> ]\r\n<current local time value function> ::=\r\nLOCALTIME [ <left paren> <time precision> <right paren> ]\r\n<current timestamp value function> ::=\r\nCURRENT_TIMESTAMP [ <left paren> <timestamp precision> <right paren> ]\r\n<current local timestamp value function> ::=\r\nLOCALTIMESTAMP [ <left paren> <timestamp precision> <right paren> ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n`LOCALTIMESTAMP()` returns the current timestamp at the start of query evaluation as TIMESTAMP WITH OUT TIME ZONE. This is similar to `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()`.\r\nNote we need to update the optimization rule `ComputeCurrentTime` so that Spark returns the same result in a single query if the function is called multiple times.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()` returns the current timestamp at the start of query evaluation.\r\n`LOCALTIMESTAMP()` returns the current timestamp without time zone at the start of query evaluation.\r\nThe `LOCALTIMESTAMP` function is an ANSI SQL.\r\nThe `LOCALTIMESTAMP` function is very useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'Yes'. Support new function `LOCALTIMESTAMP()`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew

This PR is to add some basic speculation metrics for a stage when speculation execution is enabled.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the existing stage level metrics tracking numTotal (total number of speculated tasks), numCompleted (total number of successful speculated tasks), numFailed (total number of failed speculated tasks), numKilled (total number of killed speculated tasks) etc.\r\n\r\nWith this new set of metrics, it helps further understanding speculative execution feature in the context of the application and also helps in further tuning the speculative execution config knobs.\r\n\r\nScreenshot of Spark UI with speculation summary:\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-09-22 at 12 12 20 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8871522/135321311-db7699ad-f1ae-4729-afea-d1e2c4e86103.png)\r\n\r\nScreenshot of Spark UI with API output:\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-09-22 at 12 10 37 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8871522/135321486-4dbb7a67-5580-47f8-bccf-81c758c2e988.png)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAdditional metrics for speculative execution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests added and also deployed in our internal platform for quite some time now.\r\n\r\nLead-authored by: Venkata krishnan

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere was a regression since Spark started storing large remote files on disk (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22062). In 2018 a refactoring introduced a hidden reference preventing the auto-deletion of the files (https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/a97001d21757ae214c86371141bd78a376200f66#diff-42a673b8fa5f2b999371dc97a5de7ebd2c2ec19447353d39efb7e8ebc012fe32L1677). Since then all underlying files of DownloadFile instances are kept on disk for the duration of the Spark application which sometimes results in \"no space left\" errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n`ReferenceWithCleanup` class uses `file` (the `DownloadFile`) in `cleanUp(): Unit` method so it has to keep a reference to it which prevents it from being garbage-collected.\r\n```\r\ndef cleanUp(): Unit = {\r\n  logDebug(s\"Clean up file $filePath\")\r\n\r\n  if (!file.delete()) {                                      <--- here\r\n    logDebug(s\"Fail to delete file $filePath\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nLong-running Spark applications require freeing resources when they are not needed anymore, and iterative algorithms could use all the disk space quickly too.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a test in BlockManagerSuite and tested manually.","created_at":"2021-07-08T02:17:16Z","updated_at":"2021-07-11T16:54:33Z","closed_at":"2021-07-11T16:54:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"68e6c493438371bc9cb5e616e743376d9ed661ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED
