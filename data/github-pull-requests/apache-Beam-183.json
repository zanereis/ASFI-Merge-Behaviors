If the input schema has a nested row that matches a custom user type's schema, the user can use that Java type in their DoFn parameter and Beam will convert the field to that type.\r\n\r\nR:

Added new transform called `WriteVoid` which supplies `PCollection<Void>` as output;\r\n- Moved all implementation of `Write` transform into `WriteVoid`;\r\n- Made all methods of `Write` to be the wrappers around `WriteVoid` as internal writing transform, no backwards incompatible changes for public API;\r\n- Added `withResults()` to `Write` which returns `WriteVoid` transform;\r\n- Some minor tests refactoring. \r\n\r\nR: @iemejia @jbonofre \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

BeamSQL's join rel implementation has limitations:\r\n1. only deal with RexInputRef and direct cast to RexInputRef without checking.\r\n2. only check if join condition is `() [AND () AND ...]`\r\n3. treat non equal operator (e.g. <) as equal operator (e.g. =)\r\n\r\nand more\r\n\r\nIt's a big effort to improve join rel to make it work properly in every cases. In BeamSQL,  there is a also a lack if enough test cases and test utils.\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to kick off the party and\r\n1. make JOIN condition work on field access. \r\n2. reject unsupported RexNode by an exception.\r\n\r\nThis PR is only an attempt to start to generalize join condition.\r\n\r\nThis PR also partially solves https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-7071.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR is broken off from https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/8272\r\nThe goal is to emit SampledByteCount distribution tuple system metrics from Python SDK over the FN API.\r\n\r\nThis PR will check in just the new cy_combiner for the counter, which will then be imported and released to the dataflow container, which is required prior to submitting the rest of the changes in PR/8272. This is because the dataflow container must be rebuilt first to recognize the new combiner type, which will break legacy python dataflow runner jobs.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is done by rebuilding the Pipeline object from the runner API proto if experiment 'beam_fn_api' is set.\r\nThis rebuilding fails for some of the pipeline constructs, for example ParDos due to Python ParDo object expecting a serialized Python DoFn object, coders that are not available in local (Python) SDK, etc.\r\nI get around this by introducing holder objects that will hold pipeline constructs that cannot be locally built from their proto representations.\r\nAt the Dataflow runner, I added a new 'run_XX' method for such holder PTransform where we'll do the proper runner API proto to Dataflow API proto conversion.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

- existing code using googledatastore\r\napache_beam/io/gcp/datastore/v1new - new code using\r\n  google-cloud-datastore, largely based on v1\r\n\r\nMigration path:\r\nBoth googledatastore (v1) and google-cloud-datastore (v1new) packages\r\nare listed in the dependencies, but only one can be used in the same\r\nprocess, due to protobuf module conflicts. Thus, tests for the new and\r\nold clients must be explicitly run seperately (see tox.ini and\r\nbuild.gradle).\r\nOnce the code is deemed stable enough and at least one Beam version is\r\nreleased that supports both, the old v1 code will be removed along with\r\nthe googledatastore dep.\r\n\r\nChanges compared to the old client:\r\n- Transforms now use types.{Query,Key,Entity} classes instead of\r\nprotobufs.\r\nFor more, please see\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1sL9p7NE5Z0p-5SB5uwpxWrddj_UCESKSrsvDTWNKqb4/edit#bookmark=id.hwxlz1oe7v5e\r\n(and please comment if you have additional questions).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- For mutations, the new client (google-cloud-datastore) does have\r\nmechanisms for retries (not enabled), but I've opted to keep the\r\nexisting mechanism, which does retries with exponential backoff and\r\nadaptive throttling (dynamic sizing of commit batches).\r\n- Integration test does query, upsert, and delete. Should be running on\r\n{py2,py3} x {direct_runner,dataflow_runner}.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is odd about this problem is that:\r\n- We would expect the timer set to `100` to fire when the watermark advances to 100 - but instead, it fires together with the timer set to `1000` when the watermark advances to infinity.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if we set `advance_watermark_to(101)`, the test behaves properly without any need for modifications.\r\n\r\nBUT, what's even more odd is that when doing the actual check in trigger.py as to whether the timer should be fired, we do check for `<=`. Strange.:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/transforms/trigger.py#L1273\r\n\r\nNonetheless, this change does fix the new test (which was previously failing) - and I believe it does correct the behavior.

Yes.\r\n\r\nI'll keep hunting for bugs.\r\n\r\nr: @aaltay \r\ncc: @tweise

we assumed that Job server instance should be set up on Jenkins.\r\n\r\nThis pr extends the existing cluster with job server setup. Thanks to that we won’t have to setup a dedicated Jenkins job step to setup the job server and manage the communication between Jenkins (job server_)and Fataproc (the cluster). We open up a tunnel with appropriate JobServer ports to make the cluster usage easier. \r\n\r\nOf course, setting up the cluster without the job server is still possible. To do that one needs to not pass the JOB_SERVER_IMAGE variable, \r\n\r\nOther than that, this PR includes some convenient improvements (default values for GCLOUD_ZONE and DATAPROC_VERSION) and a fix for flink init action\r\n \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR cleans up a few things:\r\n* transform.UniqueName appears to be -per bundle- in some instances, which defeats the point. Reverting until the runner I found that on changes behavior. Not caught earlier due to metrics being non-programmatically accessible at present.\r\n* Fix a go lint on the \"unset\" constants I added. ID is prefered over Id.\r\n* Actually add Combine PIDs to the list to pardos with which to export to the runner.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR:\r\n-  fixes a bug in pipeline options implementation that makes changes of multi-valued pipeline options in one view to be invisible by other views of the same pipeline options. The bug manifests when  multi-valued options are not empty before modification.\r\n- adds documentation and unit tests for codepaths affected by the bug and the fix.\r\n- cleans up experiment propagation in Dataflow runner and removes the no longer required propagation of dataflow_kms_key.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

During translation, convert each side input's corresponding RDD into bytes, which bytes are then broadcast to the Spark context. (This is necessary because in Spark we cannot broadcast an RDD directly like how we can broadcast a Dataset in Flink.)\r\n2. Pass reference to the resulting Spark broadcast variable along with a decoder for those bytes to the executable stage function.\r\n3. When the executable stage function needs to read the side inputs, it gets the broadcasted bytes value, then uses the decoder to convert the bytes to the side input value.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Converted `FlinkBatchSideInputHandlerFactory` to a pluggable `BatchSideInputHandlerFactory` to connect Spark implementation with portability framework.\r\n- For now, testing is still just a log statement with the side input value. More formal verification is still a few PRs away.\r\n- It is quite possible we will want to improve performance in the future; this is just a starting point.\r\n\r\nR: @angoenka @iemejia

was determined that CombineFns should reasonably have metrics. This PR does two things:\r\n* Populate the CombineFn PTransform id into a context.\r\n* Fix an infinite recursive loop in the context code, and added a proper test case for it.\r\n\r\nThese were caught by a stackoverflow from the latter point, due to the former point.\r\nWhile it's unlikely for a future transform to be missing it's bundleID (that's applied very early in the stack) it's likely to be missing it's ptransformID, if some new operation is added (eg. SplittableDoFns, timers, etc). Now it will clearly indicate (ptransformID unset) in this case. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
