\r\n`BlobStoreUtil`'s `getSnapshotIndex` method currently gets the `SnapshotIndex` blob using `BlobStoreManager#get` and deserializes it using `SnapshotIndexSerde`. We handle the exceptions encountered in the get step and deserialization step using the chained `handle` step. \r\nThe error log ,however, tells thats the exception was due to deserialization. This is incorrect as the `handle` will get exceptions from any of the previous steps i.e get and not just the deserialization step.\r\n\r\n**Changes**:\r\n- Change `handle` message to reflect the correct exception message\r\n\r\n**Tests**:\r\n- ./gradlew build\r\n- Added unit tests to assert if appropriate exception is thrown\r\n\r\n**API Changes**:\r\nNone\r\n\r\n**Upgrade Instructions**:

Changes\r\n\r\nIntroduce configurations allowing the job to keep processing when there is exception or timeout in the commit stage\r\n\r\n- Add new configurations \r\n  1. `task.commit.skip.commit.during.failures.enabled` with default to `false`. When the config is set to true, decouple the fatal checkpoint errors and commit timeouts from data processing\r\n  2. `task.commit.skip.commit.exception.max.limit` with default to `5`. Note that the commit period config `task.commit.ms` defaults to `60s`, the worst scenario would be the job is shut down after 5 consecutive exceptions (5 mins). \r\n  3. `task.commit.skip.commit.timeout.max.limit` with default to `2`. Note that the commit timeout config `task.commit.timeout.ms` defaults to `30mins`, the worst scenario would be the job is shut down after 2 consecutive timeouts (60 mins). \r\n- Fix / update the metrics for commit\r\n  - Update `commits-timed-out` and `commits-skipped` to Counter  \r\n  - Create new metric `commit-exceptions` denoting the counter of the exceptions during commit\r\n  - Create new metric `last-async-commit-ns` denoting the finish timestamp last successfully async \r\n- Update error / timeout handling mechanism with the config setting to true. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n- [x] executed `./gradlew build` \r\n- [x] unit test in `TestTaskInstance.scala`\r\n- [x] E2E tests (Details below) \r\n\r\nPreparation steps:\r\n1. Introduce new config `task.commit.test.commit.exception.enabled` for testing only\r\n  - When the config is set to true, a `RuntimeException` will be thrown during the commit \r\n2. Introduce new config `task.commit.test.commit. timeout.enabled` for testing only\r\n - When the config is set to true, the async stage of the commit will contains a TimeoutFuture that put the thread into sleep\r\n\r\nE2E testing: \r\n1. Build a stateful job without setting any configs introduced in this PR  -> **job works as normal**\r\n2. Set following configs -> **job works as normal**\r\n  - `task.commit.skip.commit.during.failures.enabled=true` \r\n3. Set the following configs \r\n  - `task.commit.skip.commit.during.failures.enabled=true`\r\n  - `task.commit.skip.commit.exception.max.limit=2`\r\n  - `task.commit.test.commit.exception.enabled=true`\r\nAnd the job failed with the exception below (**expected**) \r\n```\r\n“Caused by: org.apache.samza.SamzaException: Unrecoverable error during pending commit for taskName: Partition 8. Exception Counter: 3”\r\n“Caused by: java.util.concurrent.CompletionException: java.lang.RuntimeException: Exception between trimFuture and whenCompleteAsync”\r\n```\r\n4. Set the following configs \r\n  - `task.commit.skip.commit.during.failures.enabled=true`\r\n  - `task.commit.skip.commit.timeout.max.limit=2`\r\n  - `task.commit.test.commit.timeout.enabled=true`\r\n  - `job.container.thread.pool.size=16` (If this is not set, it's default to doing commit in single thread) \r\nThe job failed with the exception below (**expected**) \r\n```\r\norg.apache.samza.SamzaException: org.apache.samza.SamzaException: Timeout waiting for pending commit for taskName: Partition 0 to finish. 29998 ms have elapsed since the pending commit started. Max allowed commit delay is 8000 ms and commit timeout beyond that is 15000 ms. Timeout Counter: 3\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-27T15:44:32Z","updated_at":"2024-12-17T21:51:46Z","closed_at":"2024-11-25T18:56:07Z","merged_at":"2024-11-25T18:56:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"63c86b5e661b0a0a9a0b33a0851379b8786ee36e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/1708/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/1708/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1708/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/statuses/603dd2d1a97d289fa7f163c39059e3605e79a3d3","head":{"label":"yehaolan:keep-processing-with-failures","ref":"keep-processing-with-failures","sha":"603dd2d1a97d289fa7f163c39059e3605e79a3d3","user":{"login":"yehaolan","id":10320410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzIwNDEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10320410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehaolan","html_url":"https://github.com/yehaolan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehaolan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehaolan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehaolan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehaolan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehaolan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehaolan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehaolan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehaolan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehaolan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":833843323,"node_id":"R_kgDOMbNwew","name":"samza","full_name":"yehaolan/samza","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yehaolan","id":10320410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzIwNDEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10320410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehaolan","html_url":"https://github.com/yehaolan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehaolan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehaolan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehaolan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehaolan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehaolan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehaolan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehaolan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehaolan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yehaolan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yehaolan/samza","description":"Mirror

pr https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1705 adds the support of preventing watermark stall during lagging upstream tasks. In testing we found a bug introduced by the logic that the aggregated watermark is not advancing if the smallest watermark have been updated, but the updated tasks within the idle timeout doesn't meet quorum. The fix is to keep the previous logic if the aggregated watermark has advanced, otherwise invoking the logic for computing quorum.\r\n\r\nAlso changed the quorum count to be a metric instead of logging, due to the potential large number of logs.","created_at":"2024-08-21T20:21:25Z","updated_at":"2024-08-21T21:28:05Z","closed_at":"2024-08-21T21:28:05Z","merged_at":"2024-08-21T21:28:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"3cb57c22784448b991d1ef4e3a2928f1901b0f3a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/1707/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/1707/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1707/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/statuses/dd10f9be4e8511904307e131cab06c3efdb7091c","head":{"label":"xinyuiscool:watermark-update2","ref":"watermark-update2","sha":"dd10f9be4e8511904307e131cab06c3efdb7091c","user":{"login":"xinyuiscool","id":24738423,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzM4NDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24738423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool","html_url":"https://github.com/xinyuiscool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77248508,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzI0ODUwOA==","name":"samza","full_name":"xinyuiscool/samza","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinyuiscool","id":24738423,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzM4NDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24738423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool","html_url":"https://github.com/xinyuiscool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinyuiscool/samza","description":"Mirror

in the Samza event-time watermark aggregation logic, it will compute the watermark as the min of watermarks from all upstream tasks. However, in the lagging cases, the upstream task might not generate watermark for a long period. In this case, the new watermarks will not be generated and the downstream aggregation will be stuck.\r\n\r\nTo address this issue, this patch adds the logic to exclude the tasks that have been \"idle\" in generating watermark for a configured time, so that the aggregated watermarks will still be generated. Note this mechanism will unblock downstream, but also at the risk of moving event-time clock faster and the events from lagging tasks will become late arrivals.","created_at":"2024-08-14T00:26:16Z","updated_at":"2024-08-16T16:48:07Z","closed_at":"2024-08-16T16:48:07Z","merged_at":"2024-08-16T16:48:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"50280c60e3835c922e139c2853a227d1cce1af8f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/1705/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/1705/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1705/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/statuses/b050979c68a25befd19000993536b8ca3e00cfe8","head":{"label":"xinyuiscool:watermark-update","ref":"watermark-update","sha":"b050979c68a25befd19000993536b8ca3e00cfe8","user":{"login":"xinyuiscool","id":24738423,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzM4NDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24738423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool","html_url":"https://github.com/xinyuiscool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77248508,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzI0ODUwOA==","name":"samza","full_name":"xinyuiscool/samza","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinyuiscool","id":24738423,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzM4NDIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24738423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool","html_url":"https://github.com/xinyuiscool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyuiscool/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinyuiscool/samza","description":"Mirror

Target file size for level L can be calculated by targetFileSizeBase * (targetFileSizeMultiplier ^ (L-1)) For example, if targetFileSizeBase is 2MB and target_file_size_multiplier is 10, then each file on level-1 will be 2MB, and each file on level 2 will be 20MB, and each file on level-3 will be 200MB. by default targetFileSizeBase is 64MB.\r\n\r\n#### Before the

\r\n- If `ROCKSDB_COMPACTION_TARGET_FILE_SIZE_BASE` is configured, the value of `ROCKSDB_COMPACTION_TARGET_FILE_SIZE_BASE` will be set as the target file size base. \r\n- If `ROCKSDB_COMPACTION_TARGET_FILE_SIZE_MULTIPLIER` is configured, the value of `ROCKSDB_COMPACTION_TARGET_FILE_SIZE_MULTIPLIER` will be set as the target file size base (it's wrong, and the file size

Samza build seems to be broken currently due to dependencies that were only downloadable from JCenter, which is now shutdown. In particular, `com.burgstaller:okhttp-digest:1.10` and `org.ysb33r.gradle:grolifant:0.12`, transitive dependencies of `com.github.jruby-gradle:jruby-gradle-plugin:2.0.2`, only existed in JCenter. This change fixes the broken Samza build by rewriting some buildscript dependencies that were only present in JCenter:\r\n\r\n* Rewrites the group of `okhttp-digest` from `com.burgstaller` to `io.github.rburgst`\r\n* Updates `okhttp-digest` from `1.10` to `1.21`\r\n* Updates `grolifant` from `0.12` to `0.12.1`\r\n\r\nIdeally, `jruby-gradle-plugin`, which transitively depends on these plugins would be updated to resolve these issue, but this change fixes the problems in the meantime. The plugin has not been updated or released in quite some time. \r\n\r\n**This PR has not well-tested to see how compatible these new versions are with the Samza build. My hope is that CI builds will verify functionality isn't affected.**\r\n\r\nFor more information, see:\r\n* [Impact of final JCenter shutdown on Gradle Plugin Portal | Gradle

current system design does not allow users to create their own Azure client. Customers can only access behavior that has been exposed by configuration. This change adds the required interfaces, factories and configs required to allow customers to provide a client. This will allow users to access all options available in Azure SDKs without changes to samza-azure. \r\n\r\n**Changes**\r\n\r\n- Addition of a new interface (BlobClientBuilder) & existing AzureBlobClientBuilder to implement the newly added interface. This is done primarily to make the code more extensible.\r\n\r\n- Addition of factory classes for creation of objects, inline with factory design pattern. Replaced direct object creation of AzureBlobClientBuilder class objects which previously used new() with get objects from factory.\r\n\r\n**Upgrade instructions**: N/A\r\n\r\n**Usage Instructions**: If customers want to implement their own implementation of BlobClientBuilder, they can set the value of SYSTEM_BLOB_CLIENT_BUILDER_FACTORY_CLASS_NAME_DEFAULT to point to the corresponding factory of the new implementation class. \r\n\r\n**Compatibility**: The changes proposed here are both forward & backward compatible, since the default value of SYSTEM_BLOB_CLIENT_BUILDER_FACTORY_CLASS_NAME_DEFAULT points to org.apache.samza.system.azureblob.AzureBlobClientBuilderFactory which will create the object of AzureBlobClientBuilder, which aligns to

Introduction\r\n\r\nHadoop clusters have the ability to restrict CPU usage for Samza applications by utilizing Control Groups, (Cgroups).\r\nBefore enabling CPU enforcement on Hadoop clusters, application owners must have a way of knowing when their application is being throttled by Cgroups.  This PR will add a new Cgroup metric that makes application owners aware if containers CPU usage is being throttled by control groups & whether the application needs to request additional resources.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\n\r\nThe Linux kernel reports when applications within a Cgroup has been throttled by writing values to a file named cpu.stat.   cpu.stat contains two fields named nr_periods & nr_throttled.  nr_periods represents the number of enforcement periods that elapsed.  nr_thorttled represents the number of times the group has been throttled.  We can treat these fields as a ratio that shows the number of times applications has been throttled over a number of enforcement periods. The proposal is to have the running container locate the cpu.stat file by reading property values from Hadoop's YARN config. \r\n\r\n## Implementation details\r\n\r\n * To limit high cardinality in the metrics storage layer, instead of using the Hadoop YARN container id, the metric will emit the Samza container ID as the hostname, (ie: Container 3).  This is already supported by the existing metrics framework within Samza.\r\n* The container will emit a float value between zero and 1 as a gauge metric.  A zero value means the Cgroup was not throttled for that period of time.  A value of 1 means the Cgroup was unable to complete any work as it was persistently throttled.\r\n* To stay consistent with existing metrics, a negative value (-1) will be emitted if an exception is thrown when reading the cpu.stat file.  Exceptions when reading cpu.stat will be logged to the container logs.\r\n* This implementation will be specific to Samza on Hadoop.  The reasoning is the application itself should emit this metric, not the embedded library.\r\n\r\n## Considered Alternatives\r\n\r\nI’m unaware of alternatives but reading values from cpu.stat is a pattern which appears in the Runc project.  Runc is the underlying library for ContainerD which is used by both Docker & Kubernetes.   \r\n\r\nThe metric needs to be emitted from the Samza container itself.  Using a system daemon or sidecar application complicates deployments & creates data consistency issues when the sidecar process isn’t running.\r\n\r\n\r\n# External references\r\n\r\n* Linux [kernel

repository maintainers,\r\n\r\nI am developing a model designed to automatically generate concise and accurate summaries for open-source repositories. This model is intended to produce a one-sentence summary that briefly describes the main functions and purposes of the project. To validate the effectiveness of this summary and to further refine my model, I propose to trial my autogenerated summary in summary.md file.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of adding this summary is to quickly convey the core value of the repository in a manner that is genuinely useful to readers. Please evaluate the accuracy and practicality of this summary by scoring it on a scale from 1 to 10(1 is the worst and 10 is the best), assessing how well it succinctly communicates the project's essence. Your feedback will be crucial in helping me improve the accuracy and relevance of the model.\r\n\r\nThe submission attached includes the summary generated by my model. Please review this description and provide your scoring and any specific feedback. If you have any questions or require additional information, feel free to contact me at any time.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your valuable time and support!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nZheng

the createStore for durable stores was moved outside of constructor. However, the store directory paths are required to be set in constructor so that SamzaContainer class can set monitors for them. This patch sets the store names without creating the stores, so that monitoring can be set properly.

Description\r\n- Some implementations of `SystemProducer` can have an async implementation of the send API. \r\n- `CoordinatorStreamWriter` writes only one message and closes the underlying `CoordinatorStreamSystemProducer` right after writes. There is a chance that the producer close will be called before the async write can complete.\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n- This PR adds `flush` API to `CoordinatorStreamSystemProducer`\r\n- We will call `flush` prior to `stop` in `CoordinatorStreamWriter` so that async messages are flushed out prior to stop\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\n- `./gradlew build`\r\n- Tested with sample apps\r\n\r\n# API

every commit, we perform a cleanup phase where, among other things, we remove TTL of all the blobs associated with a SnapshotIndex. However, not all files inside a SnapshotIndex changes at every commit. More often, the files are almost identical to previous commit and only a few files are added/removed/updated. This leads to removeTTL for the same blob id repeatedly. While this is an idempotent operation, this is unnecessary. From our logs, sometimes we call removeTTL calls for the same blob 5-10 times. \r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nMaintain a simple LRU cache and store the blob id that was TTL removed and check that before making the remote call. \r\n\r\nTest:\r\nAdded a unit test to validate that the repeated calls for ttl remove are avoided.","created_at":"2023-09-25T19:44:33Z","updated_at":"2023-11-29T18:58:52Z","closed_at":"2023-11-29T18:58:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1d1d1f6f73f674b87247ac29ff52f22447723da8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/1687/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/1687/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1687/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/statuses/8ed3572bee37c04481be7c831fa455a8305f3fe8","head":{"label":"shekhars-li:master","ref":"master","sha":"8ed3572bee37c04481be7c831fa455a8305f3fe8","user":{"login":"shekhars-li","id":72765053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzY1MDUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72765053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li","html_url":"https://github.com/shekhars-li","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":303500661,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDM1MDA2NjE=","name":"samza","full_name":"shekhars-li/samza","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shekhars-li","id":72765053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzY1MDUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72765053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li","html_url":"https://github.com/shekhars-li","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shekhars-li/samza","description":"Mirror

watermark is implemented as a special message within Samza. However, in terms of processing semantics, it shares similar behavior to normal messages processed by the task. i.e., `task.callback.timeout.ms`, a configuration to tune the time until which runloop waits for a message to be processed applies to both watermark and normal messages. \r\n\r\nHowever, this tie up constrains watermark processing logic to be bounded by the processing messages time bound. For Beam on Samza, we use watermark as a trigger to execute event timers which can take a long time depending on the number of timers accumulated. Especially, when the application is down, the timers accumulated could be too large and users will have to tune this configuration which will also impact fault tolerance behavior in case of failures/delays during processing messages.\r\n\r\n**Changes**:\r\n- Introduce callback timeout configuration specific to watermark\r\n- Update configuration documentation\r\n- Consolidate overload methods for `TaskCallbackManager`\r\n- Always use watermark specific timeout even when run loop is in draining mode\r\n\r\n**Tests**:\r\n- Added unit test for `TestRunLoop`\r\n- Added unit tests for `RunLoopConfig`\r\n\r\n**API Changes**: \r\n- Internal change to constructor\r\n\r\n**Upgrade Instructions**: None\r\n**Usage Instructions**:\r\n- Users can configure the timeout for watermark messages using `task.callback.watermark.timeout.ms`\r\n- Refer to the configuration documentation for more details and defaults.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Pull request is stacked on #1680 .

currently takes in lot of parameters and the constructor has grown to the point where it is unmanageable with multiple overloads. Introducing new configuration requires lot of updates to existing tests and components even if the parameters have no effect on all of the usages.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, we should be able to decouple different users of RunLoop and enable these components to have their own scoped config. e.g., `SideInputManager` can now have its own set of runloop parameters without having to tie itself with `TaskConfig`.\r\n\r\n**Changes**:\r\n- Introduce `RunLoopConfig`, a container object to hold all required parameters for runloop from `Config`.\r\n- Remove existing overloads of constructor \r\n- Simplify the constructor to take `RunLoopConfig` and initialize the necessary components and fields\r\n- Introduce `SideInputManagerRunLoopConfig`, an overload of `RunLoopConfig` to be used within `SideInputManager`\r\n- Modify RunLoopFactory create method signature\r\n- Clean up `ApplicationUtil` and moved the method to `ApplicationConfig` and added unit tests\r\n\r\n**Tests**:\r\n- Unit test\r\n\r\n**API Changes**:\r\n- No external API change\r\n\r\n**Usage Instructions**: N.A\r\n**Upgrade Instructions**: N.A\r\n\r\n**Note**: This PR serves as foundation for

Intermediate stream partition count inference logic caps the partition size to 256 resulting in imbalances in work assignments to tasks\r\n\r\n**Description**: As part of the intermediate partition size inference logic, we currently employ the following algorithm.\r\n\r\n- partitionCount = Math.max(maxPartitionSize(inputStreams), maxPartitionSize(outputStreams))\r\n- cap the partitionCount to MAX_INFERRED_PARTITIONS defined in the `IntermediateStreamManager` which is 256\r\n- apply the inferred partition count to intermediate streams whose partition count is uninitialized\r\n\r\nThe logic above always caps the partition size of intermediate streams to 256 for all auto-created intermediate streams. This can prevent the job from scaling up uniformly as the intermediate partition assignment is capped to 256 tasks thereby rendering other tasks imbalanced in case of number tasks > 256.\r\n\r\n**Changes**:\r\n- Apply the cap only for batch mode as 256 limit was introduced for batch mode where number of files (partition) could be large\r\n- Add unit tests for `IntermediateStreamManager`\r\n- Minor java doc fix for `DefaultTaskExecutorFactory`\r\n\r\n**Tests**: Added unit tests for the code changes\r\n\r\n**API Changes**: None\r\n\r\n**Upgrade Instructions**:\r\n- Jobs that are temporarily worked around this constraint by setting `job.intermediate.stream.partitions` should remove the configuration in order for samza to infer and apply the partition count as described above\r\n- Jobs that don't use `job.intermediate.stream.partitions` need no changes.\r\n\r\n**Usage Instructions**: Refer to upgrade

have observed that Samza YARN AM requests 2-3x more containers than needed during job startup. Can cause temporary resource exhaustion in cluster when large jobs are launched, causing unrelated deployments to timeout/fail.\r\n\r\nChange:\r\nThis PR added a Samza AM metric to monitor how many containers are allocated by RM and buffered in AM \r\nThe metric increments when AM got an allocated container from RM and add it to the buffer. The metric decrements when AM released the overallocated containers (after all processors started). \r\n\r\nBy observing this metric, we can know how many containers were allocated to a job during its startup and how long before the overallocated ones got released.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-30T18:11:56Z","updated_at":"2023-07-18T20:14:00Z","closed_at":"2023-07-18T20:13:59Z","merged_at":"2023-07-18T20:13:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"7dee9977a4cc689d80376c1f53817af90aa5accb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/1677/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/1677/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1677/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/statuses/fc92b609cddb2d508c055b97f8da9256b54d215b","head":{"label":"jia-gao:master","ref":"master","sha":"fc92b609cddb2d508c055b97f8da9256b54d215b","user":{"login":"jia-gao","id":94939653,"node_id":"U_kgDOBaiqBQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94939653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao","html_url":"https://github.com/jia-gao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":431292144,"node_id":"R_kgDOGbT-8A","name":"samza","full_name":"jia-gao/samza","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jia-gao","id":94939653,"node_id":"U_kgDOBaiqBQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94939653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao","html_url":"https://github.com/jia-gao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jia-gao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jia-gao/samza","description":"Mirror

Statement:\r\n- Yarn can sometimes create orphaned containers. In our production systems, we noticed that there were overlapping Samza containers running/committing at the same time. \r\n- If the stores are backed up to a blob store, this orphaned and overlapping container may delete a blob (which is common during delta state calculation in commit lifecycle with blob store backend). The other non-orphaned container may expect this blob to be present. \r\n- This causes the container and subsequently the job to fail. During this, the container fails with DeletedException - which is Blob store's response that the blob was present but is gone now. \r\n\r\nFix:\r\n- During commit, if a container fails with DeletedException, let the container fail/restart.\r\n- During the recovery phase of the restart, get the deleted blob with get() call with getDeleted flag that indicates that if the blob is marked for deletion but not yet compacted, blob store should return it. \r\n- Recreate the new blob by uploading it to blob store afresh. Use the new blob id received to create a new checkpoint.\r\n- Write this new checkpoint to the checkpoint topic.\r\n- After this, and as long as orphaned container is not cleaned up by Yarn, the container should be able to commit regulary. \r\n\r\nAPI Changes:\r\n- GET API call to Blob Store now accepts a GetDeleted boolean. This boolean identifies if the blob store should return a deleted, but not yet compacted blob.\r\n\r\nTests:\r\n- Integration tests to test recovery after a deleted SnapshotIndex and deleted regular blob (FileBlob) \r\n- Unit test to validate init and restore lifecycle with retries on DeletedException

Changes\r\nKafkaCheckpointManager is a reused class. On reuse, the `SystemConsumer` can be left unclosed, and a memory leak.\r\n\r\nThis is because SystemConsumer is started on each start, but closed when \r\n1. `taskNamesToCheckpoints == null` and `stopConsumerAfterFirstRead == true`, or\r\n2. `stopConsumerAfterFirstRead == false`\r\n\r\nOn the second run, `taskNamesToCheckpoints != null`, and SystemConsumer is never closed.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 fixes.\r\n1. Adding a patch to close SystemConsumer properly\r\n4. Setting taskNamesToCheckpoints back to `null` on `stop()`\r\n\r\nWe are choosing solution 1., since the `stopConsumerAfterFirstRead ` option expects only 1 read per task(?). \r\n\r\n# Issue\r\n[SAMZA-2785](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SAMZA-2785)\r\n\r\nCalling start() and stop() multiple times on the same KafkaCheckpointManager, while stopConsumerAfterFirstRead == true, causes the SystemConsumer left unclosed.

This PR corrects that and updates both sites to a similar code structure.\r\n \r\nTests: No new tests were added.

Summary\r\n\r\nRe-factor `DirDiffUtil.getDirDiff` to minimize calls to sun.nio.fs.*\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nProfiling a real-world job showed ~38% of the time being spent in `DirDiffUtil.getDirDiff` for a given profile snapshot.  Investigating it seems that the call to `DirDiffUtil.areSameFile` is the primary cause of `DirDiffUtil.getDirDiff` showing up high on this particular profile.  Looking at the code there is the following comment:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  // TODO MED shesharm: this compares each file in directory 3 times. Categorize files in one traversal instead.\r\n```\r\n\r\nRe-factored creation of the lists `filesToUpload`, `filesToRetain`, and `filesToRemove` to iterate on the files once which reduces the number of times `DirDiffUtil.areSameFile` is called.  \r\n\r\nThe re-factor should reduce the number of calls by reducing the number of calls to `areSameFile`.  it is also noticed that inside of `areSameFile` there are calls to getting owner and user.  The expected number of users/groups is very small and the repeated calls to get the name from the id can be cached effectively.  Overload creation of `areSameFile` to cache calls to get user and owner.\r\n\r\nJIRA=[SAMZA-2783](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SAMZA-2783)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n`./gradlew clean && ./gradlew

single threaded executor otherwise.\r\n\r\n**Testing**:\r\n- Unit tests for the factory\r\n- Test updates for existing `OperatorImpl` tests.\r\n\r\n**API Changes**:\r\n- Add `getOperatorExecutor` to

PR publishes a build scan for every CI build on Jenkins and GitHub Actions and for every local build from an authenticated Apache committer. The build will not fail if publishing fails.\r\n\r\nThe build scans of the Apache Samza project are published to the Gradle Enterprise instance at [ge.apache.org](https://ge.apache.org/), hosted by the Apache Software Foundation and run in partnership between the ASF and Gradle. This Gradle Enterprise instance has all features and extensions enabled and is freely available for use by the Apache Samza project and all other Apache projects.\r\n\r\nThis pull request enhances the functionality of publishing build scans to the publicly available [scans.gradle.com](https://scans.gradle.com/) by instead publishing build scans to [ge.apache.org](https://ge.apache.org/). On this Gradle Enterprise instance, Apache Samza will have access not only to all of the published build scans but other aggregate data features such as:\r\n\r\n- Dashboards to view all historical build scans, along with performance trends over time\r\n- Build failure analytics for enhanced investigation and diagnosis of build failures\r\n- Test failure analytics to better understand trends and causes around slow, failing, and flaky tests\r\n\r\nIf interested in exploring a fully populated Gradle Enterprise instance, please explore the builds already connected to [ge.apache.org](https://ge.apache.org/), the [Spring project’s instance](https://ge.spring.io/scans?search.relativeStartTime=P28D&search.timeZoneId=Europe/Zurich), or any number of other [OSS projects](https://gradle.com/enterprise-customers/oss-projects/) for which we sponsor instances of Gradle Enterprise.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there are any questions about the value of Gradle Enterprise or the changes in this pull request and I’d be happy to address them.","created_at":"2023-05-09T13:51:39Z","updated_at":"2023-06-20T13:20:18Z","closed_at":"2023-05-09T17:31:45Z","merged_at":"2023-05-09T17:31:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"524d68705c23b94d9eecd16c83915e83e95ec67d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/1665/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/1665/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1665/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/statuses/2271509d79016508a80b5a354c5a82f7e03b21f7","head":{"label":"clayburn:connect-to-ge.apache.org","ref":"connect-to-ge.apache.org","sha":"2271509d79016508a80b5a354c5a82f7e03b21f7","user":{"login":"clayburn","id":625514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTUxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/625514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn","html_url":"https://github.com/clayburn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":638500437,"node_id":"R_kgDOJg6-VQ","name":"samza","full_name":"clayburn/samza","private":false,"owner":{"login":"clayburn","id":625514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTUxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/625514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn","html_url":"https://github.com/clayburn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/clayburn/samza","description":"Mirror

Symptom: \r\nJVM crashes due to OOM exceptions. When the system has a large number of `AzureBlobWriterObjects`, the memory becomes heavily fragmented and can be susceptible to crashing when a new `AzureBlobOutputStream` is created.\r\n\r\n### Cause:\r\nThe crashes are caused by inefficient memory management when using the G1GC. (The default garbage collector in Java 11+.) What causes (code paths) this issue and why this is a problem for the G1GC are examined separately.\r\n\r\n#### What causes this issue?\r\nThe underlying issue is caused by the `AzureBlobOutputStream`. When a new instance is created, it creates a new [ByteArrayOutputStream](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/ByteArrayOutputStream.html) initialized to _maxFlushThresholdSize_.[^1][^2] The `ByteArrayOutputStream` is the buffer used by the parent to accumulate messages between flush intervals. It requires 10MB (current default) of memory to initialize. This allows the buffer to accumulate messages without resize operations, however, it does **not** prevent resizing. The _maxFlushThresholdSize_ is enforced in the parent during `write()` - see [AzureBlobAvroWriter](https://github.com/ehoner/samza/blob/03b187a6de0e123568f3ce3af94c946e6380fc8d/samza-azure/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/system/azureblob/avro/AzureBlobAvroWriter.java#L174).\r\n\r\n#### Why this is a problem for the G1GC?\r\nThe focus here is on the G1GC and humongous objects (G1 specific).[^3] The G1 GC introduced a new memory management strategy that divides the heap into regions, `-XX:G1HeapRegionSize=n`. The GC can operate on regions concurrently and copies live objects between regions during full GC to reclaim/empty regions.[^4] The default behavior creates ~2048 regions, sized to a factor of 2 between 1MB and 32MB. Any object larger than half of a region size, is considered a humongous object. \r\nHumongous objects are allocated an entire region (or consecutive regions if larger than a single region) and are not copied between regions during full GC. Any space not used by the object within a region is non-addressable for the life of the object.[^5] A JVM heap size of 31GB, `-Xmx31G`, will default to 16MB regions. Considering the current default size is 10MB, each buffer requires an entire region **and** prevents the use of 6MB, regardless of the how much data is in the buffer. For a heap smaller than 16GB, each buffer would require multiple regions. \r\nThe 10MB buffer size can exhaust the regions and cause OOMs or create fragmentation that causes OOMs. A fragmentation caused OOM occurs in the following sequence. On `new`, the JVM attempts to create the object in Eden. If there is insufficient space in Eden a minor GC is performed. If there is insufficient space after minor GC, the object is immediately promoted Old Gen. If there is insufficient space in Old Gen, a full GC is performed. If a full GC cannot allocate memory or region(s) for a humongous object the JVM will exit with OOM. \r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\nThe javadocs, where appropriate, have been updated to reflect changes or describe new behaviors. No public APIs were removed, they were marked deprecated and migrated to the new default initialization value. All of the changes are itemized below. \r\n\r\n#### AzureBlobConfig\r\nAdding two new public fields and one public method. The new configuration is made accessible in the same manner as existing configs (see #configs [SEP-26](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SAMZA/SEP-26:+Azure+Blob+Storage+Producer)), also consistent the [coding-guide](https://samza.apache.org/contribute/coding-guide.html). There is a new public config key: `SYSTEM_INIT_BUFFER_SIZE` - named _initBufferSize.bytes_. The default value is public field `SYSTEM_INIT_BUFFER_SIZE_DEFAULT`. The user provided configuration value is accessible with new public method `getInitBufferSizeBytes(..)`. The method returns the configuration value between 32 and `getMaxFlushThresholdSize(..)` inclusive. 32 is the default initialization size of a `ByteArrayOutputStream` in the parameterless constructor.\r\n\r\n#### AzureBlobWriterFactory\r\nThere are two changes to this interface, both to the method, `getWriterInstance(..)`. The existing implementation is marked `@Deprecated` and a new method with an additional parameter is added. The new parameter is an `int` that is expected to be the _ initBufferSize_.\r\n\r\n#### AzureBlobAvroWriterFactory\r\nThe modifications here are consistent with the changes to interface `AzureBlobWriterFactory`. However, the deprecated implementation uses the new field `AzureBlobConfig.SYSTEM_INIT_BUFFER_SIZE_DEFAULT` when calling the new public API. This will migrate users to the new initialization behavior.\r\n\r\n#### AzureBlobAvroWriter\r\nThere are two public, one package-private, and two private changes. Both public changes are to constructors. The existing public constructor is marked deprecated and invokes the new public constructor with the new field `AzureBlobConfig.SYSTEM_INIT_BUFFER_SIZE_DEFAULT`. The new constructor sets the new private field `initBufferSize`. The package-private constructor is modified with an additional `int` parameter and the tests were changed accordingly. The remaining private change modifies creation of new `AzureBlobOutputStream` instances to include the additional private field `initBufferSize`.\r\n\r\n#### AzureBlobOutputStream\r\nThe existing public API is marked `@Deprecated` and the `ByteArrayOutputStream` is initialized with the new field `AzureBlobConfig.SYSTEM_INIT_BUFFER_SIZE_DEFAULT`. The new public constructor includes the new parameter `initBufferSize` and initializes the `ByteArrayOutputStream` to that size.\r\n\r\n### Tests: \r\nBoth test classes, `TestAzureBlobAvroWriter` and `TestAzureBlobOutputStream` were modified to use the new field `AzureBlobConfig.SYSTEM_INIT_BUFFER_SIZE_DEFAULT`.\r\n\r\nNo unit or integration tests were added to verify the GC behavior. The performance of the new system analyzed with [JXray](https://jxray.com/) and compared to previous analyses. The number of humongous objects was reduced from >80% to <25%.\r\n\r\n[^1]: The configuration values are set from either

Feature\r\nAdd support for `GenericFixed` types to `AzureBlobAvroWriter`, the Samza provided implementation for `AzureBlobWriter`. This allows the caller to provide the `Schema` **and** deserialized object in the `OutgoingMessageEnvelope`. Using `GenericFixed`, the caller can avoid the CPU overhead of deserialization and guarantee that the `Schema` is set in the writer instance.\r\n\r\n#### Discussion\r\nThe existing implementation requires that all messages are either of type `IndexedRecord` - a deserialized object with `Schema` - or an Avro-encoded `byte[]` - deserialized object without `Schema`. The writer aggregates these messages in an Avro file format which requires a `Schema`. Because the `Schema` is unset when the writer is initialized, it cannot aggregate the messages, until the caller sends an `IndexedRecord`.\r\n\r\nWithout `GenericFixed`, in order avoid deserialization (CPU cost), the caller **must** send an `IndexedRecord` as the first message to a new writer instance, then a `byte[]` for subsequent messages until `flush()`. This requires the caller track the state in the writer instances, but do so through the \"SystemProducer\". In the existing implementation, `AzureBlobSystemProducer`, the writer instances are private and are closed on [flush()](https://github.com/ehoner/samza/blob/03b187a6de0e123568f3ce3af94c946e6380fc8d/samza-azure/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/system/azureblob/producer/AzureBlobSystemProducer.java#L334).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n1. No public API change.\r\n    These changes are to the Samza provided implementation and not to the original design in [SEP-26](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SAMZA/SEP-26:+Azure+Blob+Storage+Producer). These changes extend item 3 under \"[Implementation](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SAMZA/SEP-26:+Azure+Blob+Storage+Producer#SEP26:AzureBlobStorageProducer-Implementation/TestPlan)\", see AvroAzureBlobWriter is an AzureBlobWriter implementation to write messages which are Avro record....\r\n1. Updated javadocs. \r\n1. Replaced type parameter for `DataFileWriter`, from `IndexedRecord` to `Object`. \r\n    The type parameter is specific to the data encoded by Avro, not necessarily the format/type received by the writer instance.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nNew test: `testWriteGenericFixed()`.\r\nAdds private class `GenericFixedEvent` and method `createOMEGenericFixed(...)`. These repeat the existing test patterns used by classes `GenericRecordEvent` and `SpecificRecordEvent` and their respective methods `createOMEGenericRecord(...)` and `createOME(...)`.\r\n\r\n### Avro Background\r\nAzureBlob storage expects an Avro encoded file format. The file format supports multiple records of a single `Schema`. In order to create the format, the writer instance **must** provide a `Schema` - see [DataFileWriter](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.7.7/api/java/org/apache/avro/file/DataFileWriter.html). The existing implementation expects an [IndexedRecord](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.7.7/api/java/org/apache/avro/generic/IndexedRecord.html) to access both `Schema` **and** data. The `IndexedRecord` is the sub type of [GenericContainer](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.7.7/api/java/org/apache/avro/generic/GenericContainer.html), which is what provides `getSchema()`.  `GenericContainer` has only one other sub type, [GenericFixed](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.7.7/api/java/org/apache/avro/generic/GenericFixed.html). The difference between \"records\" and \"fixed\" types is (de)serialization. `GenericFixed` objects are _serialized_ data and their `Schema`; while `IndexedRecord`s are _deserialized_ data and their

Blob store state restore fails when verifying restored directory contents due to a mismatch between permissions of local vs remote files.\r\n \r\nCause: Apache Commons 2.11 (at least, more versions may be affected) FileUtils#deleteDirectory() has a bug where it changes the permissions of symlink/hardlink files to read-only after deletion. For more details, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IO-751. This means that TaskStorageCommitManager#deleteOldCheckpointDirs() causes the permissions for the original store files hard-linked from the checkpoint directory to be changed to read only. This causes the file to be considered different than the one already uploaded on next checkpoint and re-uploaded. Since restore recreates all files in rw mode, they fail post-restore verifications due to permissions mismatch.\r\n \r\nChanges: \r\nSince we cannot control which commons-io version the user application is using, this PR changes all uses of FileUtils#deleteDirectory to PathUtils#deleteDirectory() which is not affected. (according to the ticket above, and verifed with the failing test).\r\nUnrelated cleanup: changed state backend integration tests to use a unique temp directory for each run.\r\n \r\nTests: Discovered with the BlobStoreStateBackendIntegrationTest added in PR #1657. Verified fix by re-running test with the bad apache-commons version.","created_at":"2023-03-22T03:56:36Z","updated_at":"2023-03-22T17:03:32Z","closed_at":"2023-03-22T17:03:32Z","merged_at":"2023-03-22T17:03:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"985a6048c1e589d0b3af5d0040f26b64741c9260","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/1658/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/1658/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1658/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/statuses/237d05de9c3946f14b4afe0be5b59edafc0c1064","head":{"label":"prateekm:apache-commons-fileutils-fix","ref":"apache-commons-fileutils-fix","sha":"237d05de9c3946f14b4afe0be5b59edafc0c1064","user":{"login":"prateekm","id":1085859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODU4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm","html_url":"https://github.com/prateekm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":75019478,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NTAxOTQ3OA==","name":"samza","full_name":"prateekm/samza","private":false,"owner":{"login":"prateekm","id":1085859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODU4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm","html_url":"https://github.com/prateekm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/prateekm/samza","description":"Mirror

Allow bulk restore from blob store for side input stores. If a blob store state backend is available, side input store restores can be sped up significantly by bulk-restoring initial state from the blob store, and only using the Kafka side input topic to catch up on the delta since last checkpoint. \r\n\r\nAdditional Context for Reviewers:\r\n\r\n1. Side inputs RunLoop and regular Task RunLoop are separate and commit independently. \r\n2. SideInputTask commit flushes the the side input store and writes the SIDE-INPUT-OFFSETS file in the store directory, but does not create a store checkpoint or upload it to the state backend. \r\n3. This SIDE-INPUT-OFFSETS file is used during side input restore to determine the starting offset in the side input topic. \r\n4. Regular Task commit creates store checkpoints, uploads them to the state backends, and saves the resulting store StateCheckpointMarker in the task checkpoint, but currently does not copy the SIDE-INPUT-OFFSETS file to the checkpoint directry.\r\n\r\n \r\nChanges:\r\nThis is a follow up to #1654 and #1655 \r\n\r\n1. Copy the SIDE-INPUT-OFFSETS file (if exists) to the side input store checkpoint directory created during regular Task commit, so that it can be backed up along with the side input store contents and used during restore for incremental catchup. This copying needs to be done under process-wide synchronization to avoid data corruption, since the two RunLoops are currently completely independent of each other and do not coordinate/synchronize their commits, and there are no atomic file copy APIs.\r\n2. If a blob store state backend factory is configured for side input stores, use it to do an inital bulk restore in ContainerStorageManager before starting the incremental restore and consumption from side input topics.\r\n3. Fixed a bug found during additional testing: in-memory stores configured with a changelog are not being restored correctly. The store instance created initially is retained but not restored, instead a new store instance is created and restored from changelog, and then thrown away.\r\n\r\n \r\n Tests: Added new integration tests to verify BlobStoreStateBackend functionality in general, and the new BlobStoreStateBackend + Side Inputs functionality in particular. Streamlined integration tests for state backends, and added new tests for Kafka based non-transactional changelog restore.","created_at":"2023-03-18T02:08:53Z","updated_at":"2023-03-21T19:33:31Z","closed_at":"2023-03-21T19:33:31Z","merged_at":"2023-03-21T19:33:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"d261a0b6962f4f733c742821b4dbf87f64038979","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/1657/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/1657/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1657/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/statuses/a929c2ca8e4c2e392557e38a55d814dead95666a","head":{"label":"prateekm:side-inputs-blob-store-restore-part-3","ref":"side-inputs-blob-store-restore-part-3","sha":"a929c2ca8e4c2e392557e38a55d814dead95666a","user":{"login":"prateekm","id":1085859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODU4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm","html_url":"https://github.com/prateekm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":75019478,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NTAxOTQ3OA==","name":"samza","full_name":"prateekm/samza","private":false,"owner":{"login":"prateekm","id":1085859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODU4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1085859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm","html_url":"https://github.com/prateekm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prateekm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/prateekm/samza","description":"Mirror

ContainerStorageManager has gotten very unwieldy with 1000+ LOC of highly complex and invocation-order dependent logic. It also does too much by trying to manage side inputs lifecycle along with regular state stores'.\r\n \r\nChanges: \r\n    1. Separated side inputs (and standby) related store creation and restore logic into a separate SideInputsManager class.\r\n    2. Separated helper methods into a ContainerStorageManagerUtil class, and made them all static to ensure that they don't mutate class fields. \r\n\r\nMost of the PR is simply moving code from one place to another.

1 of 2. Follow up PR to restore side input stores using Blob Store backups coming soon.\r\n\r\nSymptoms: \r\n1. Side input stores are uploaded twice when using Blob Store State Backend.\r\n2. Store-level Gauges (but not Timers) in BlobStoreBackupManagerMetrics are broken for side input stores.\r\n3. Task level Gauges in BlobStoreBackupManagerMetrics have incorrect value (count twice for side input stores).\r\n\r\nCause: \r\n1. StorageConfig#getStoreNames() returns side input stores twice in the list. \r\n2. BlobStoreBackupManager does not dedup storesToBackup list.\r\n3. PR #1223 makes the duplicate-registration behavior between Gauges and Timers inconsistent.\r\n \r\nChanges: \r\n1. Fixed StorageConfig#getStoreNames() to dedup store names.\r\n2. Added defensive dedup in BlobStoreBackupManager.\r\n3. Changed store level metrics initialization in BlobStoreBackupManagerMetrics to computeIfAbsent instead of putIfAbsent to avoid overwriting-yet-returning-old-Gauges in case of duplicate store

StreamAppender, there is a synchronized block around setupSystem(), which should be called the first time (after loggingContext config is set up) any logger logs something.\r\nIt could lead to a deadlock situation. Because if during the setupSystem(), any other threads try to do LOG.xxx(), they will be blocked, and if the system setup depends on those threads, it leads to deadlock\r\n\r\nChange:\r\nReplace the synchronized block with a [tryLock](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html#tryLock(long,%20java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit))(long time, [TimeUnit](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/TimeUnit.html) unit)\r\nso that other threads won't be blocked forever if setupSystem() stuck or timeout\r\n\r\nUsage Change:\r\nIf any thread try to log during the time that another thread is setting up the stream, it will wait for SET_UP_SYSTEM_TIMEOUT_MILLI_SECONDS. If timeout, StreamAppender will skip sending its log event\r\n\r\nNote that before the change, the thread will block and wait until the stream setting up is done. This behavior opens the chance of deadlock and needs to be changed\r\n\r\nTest Done:\r\nAdd new units for the change\r\n./gradlew

Past tests were re-run to verify they are still passing.","created_at":"2023-01-06T22:37:03Z","updated_at":"2023-01-10T00:30:22Z","closed_at":"2023-01-10T00:30:22Z","merged_at":"2023-01-10T00:30:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"a0d12da6eba7279fe0882a92ac282e935810dee1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/1648/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/1648/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1648/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/statuses/8b4beb6ef00717e0691680fea0f2522fd1439375","head":{"label":"shekhars-li:master","ref":"master","sha":"8b4beb6ef00717e0691680fea0f2522fd1439375","user":{"login":"shekhars-li","id":72765053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzY1MDUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72765053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li","html_url":"https://github.com/shekhars-li","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":303500661,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDM1MDA2NjE=","name":"samza","full_name":"shekhars-li/samza","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shekhars-li","id":72765053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzY1MDUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72765053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li","html_url":"https://github.com/shekhars-li","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekhars-li/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shekhars-li/samza","description":"Mirror

Summary\r\nThis change moves Jekyll dependency management into Gradle. Contributors will no longer be required to install ruby & Jekyll by hand.\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n* Gemfiles no longer manage dependencies.  This is done with the jruby-gradle-plugin Gradle plugin.  \r\n     * rubygems.org is still the source of Ruby libraries\r\n* The locally install MRI Ruby interpreter is replaced with JRuby.  \r\n     * This allows the Ruby interpreter to be a part of the Samza project.\r\n* Jekyll plugin changes\r\n     * Rouge replaces pygments.rb. Rouge is native Ruby and does not have a python requirement.\r\n     * Kramdown replaces Redcarpet because Redcarpet does not work with JRuby.\r\n     * Both Kramdown & Rouge can run inside the JRuby JVM.\r\n* buildscript.gradle\r\n     * jcenter.bintray.com is no longer active.\r\n     * plugins.gradle.org has the required plugins\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\nTesting was done with JDK 1.8 and on Linux.  I visually confirmed that content generated with JRuby looks like content generated by MRI Ruby by running two Jekyll instances at the same time.  Both Jekyll instances threw the same errors for missing content at `/learn/documentation/latest`.   I'm open to suggestions for improving confidence relating to the Jekyll plugin changes.\r\n\r\nI also ran `./gradlew test` which built successfully.

We introduced blob store backed for state backup and restore in [this commit](https://github.com/apache/samza/commit/7cc4eaa96fff244f6dce9c18af804917db7c3b2b).\r\n- `StateBackendFactory` implementations like for Kafka and BlobStore create systemAdmins every time `getBackupFactory` is called from `SamzaContainer`. This leads to creation of duplicate kafka admin threads. \r\n- This has impact on performance of large samza jobs as we have thousands of duplicate threads spawned.\r\n\r\nFix\r\n- Pass `systemAdminsMap` to `getBackendFactory` method. This initializes the SystemAdmins with the system admin map rather than creating system admins every time the method is called. \r\n\r\nTest\r\n- Tested with local jobs to verify the kafka admin threads are not duplicated.

\r\nWe observed logging data loss happens in StreamAppender\r\nThe RC is the current implementation of the “[append()](https://github.com/apache/samza/blob/master/samza-log4j/src/main/java/org/apache/samza/logging/log4j/StreamAppender.java#L146)” method uses one AtomicBoolean variable to detect if the thread is called recursively, which could lead to race conditions when \"append()\" is invoked by multiple threads and could cause log data loss.\r\n\r\nwe have reproduced the data loss issue locally in the multithread logging scenarios.\r\n\r\nWhen the current implementation was introduced in samza, log4j1 framework didn't have recursive call prevention logic at the framework layer. More context can be found in [SAMZA-723](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SAMZA-723)\r\n\r\nHowever, the current implementation in samza has the side effect that data loss might occur in the parallel logging scenario. We believe it is a bug existing for a long time but never got noticed. \r\n\r\n\r\nChange:\r\nSamza now is upgraded to [log4j2 framework](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/blob/release-2.x/log4j-core/src/main/java/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/config/AppenderControl.java#L122) which applies recursive call prevention at the framework layer\r\n\r\nSo we don't need recursive call prevention logic at Samza\r\n\r\nAPI Changes:\r\nRemove a metric recursiveCalls from StreamAppenderMetrics since it is no longer used\r\n\r\nTest Done:\r\n./gradlew

Symptoms and Cause:\r\nThere were a few issues with the processing of drain messages that this PR attempts to fix. The following issues were encountered during the end-to-end testing with test pipelines.\r\n\r\n1. It was observed that the `RunLoop` was running into an exception when a task was trying to consume from intermediate streams.\r\n\r\nThis was happening as we stop all consumers in `SystemConsumers` when we encounter drain. This also stops the consumers which ingest data from the intermediate streams. \r\n\r\n_After 1 was resolved, some additional issues were observed-_\r\n2. The pipeline was getting stuck after partial consumption of data after the last shuffle stage. \r\n\r\nThis was happening as we were removing the SSPs from the processing set of SSPs for a task for high-level API processing. This was leading to unprocessed drain messages and thereby, the pipeline would remain stuck.\r\n\r\n3. The pipeline would get stuck if a drain message was encountered prior to the start of the container. \r\n\r\nThis is happening as we set the `SystemConsumers` to drain mode before it is even started by `SamzaContainer`. As a result, no messages are read by the container.\r\n\r\n# Changes:\r\n1. Changed the `SystemConsumers` code to remove the line which stopped registered `SystemConsumer`s on drain. \r\n\r\n2. Restrict the logic to remove the SSP from the processing SSP set only to low-level API. For high-level API, drain should be solely handled by Operator DAG. Additionally, ask the `TaskCoordinator` to commit the task once all streams for a task have drained.\r\n\r\n3. To fix the issue of pipeline getting stuck if a drain control message was present prior to container start, drain and watermark control messages are written to the in-memory buffer on `SystemConsumers` start if it is already is in drain mode.\r\n\r\n# Tests:\r\n- End to end tests for both high-level and low-level API\r\n- Unit tests for Drain in RunLoop\r\n- Integ test for Drain for High-level and Low-Level API- DrainLowLevelApiIntegrationTest & DrainHighLevelApiIntegrationTest\r\n\r\n# API changes:\r\nNone\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-01T16:57:13Z","updated_at":"2022-11-07T02:08:18Z","closed_at":"2022-11-03T20:31:24Z","merged_at":"2022-11-03T20:31:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"3d4747c5c2cfc2aadff42bca562f1fbfb4acad0b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/1639/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/1639/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/issues/1639/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/samza/statuses/6eb03469707adde4653265dae177697ef4cd0afb","head":{"label":"ajothomas:DrainProcessingFixes","ref":"DrainProcessingFixes","sha":"6eb03469707adde4653265dae177697ef4cd0afb","user":{"login":"ajothomas","id":950817,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MDgxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/950817?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajothomas","html_url":"https://github.com/ajothomas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajothomas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajothomas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajothomas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajothomas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajothomas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajothomas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajothomas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajothomas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajothomas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":350812939,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTA4MTI5Mzk=","name":"samza","full_name":"ajothomas/samza","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ajothomas","id":950817,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MDgxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/950817?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajothomas","html_url":"https://github.com/ajothomas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajothomas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajothomas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajothomas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajothomas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajothomas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajothomas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajothomas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajothomas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajothomas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ajothomas/samza","description":"Mirror

Improvement:\r\n\r\nThis PR is a part of the Pipeline Drain work and aims to provide a way to specify a task callback timeout to be used for pipeline drain. The standard `task.callback.timeout.ms` parameter might be too small for the drain operation to complete. Drain operation will involve clearing of intermediate state which might require a larger timeout for the task callback.

Symptom\r\n\r\nWe have observed that some use cases used quasar(TensorFlow framework) to do model inference and this framework spawn child processes(non-JVM) to run TensorFlow serving. These child processes were using high CPU usage(200%) however their CPU usage can't be captured by the existing CPU usage metric `process-cpu-usage`\r\n\r\n# Cause\r\n\r\nThe existing metric `process-cpu-usage` metric was designed for capturing the [CPU usage for the JVM process](https://samza.apache.org/learn/documentation/1.6.0/operations/monitoring.html) only, it can't count the child processes(especially for non-JVM processes) usage.\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n\r\n- Reply on [oshi framwork](https://www.oshi.ooo/) to capture the CPU usage for the JVM process and all its child processes, and create a new metric to display the total CPU usage.\r\n- The CPU usage percentage is calculated based on top of the logical CPU count on the system\r\n\r\n# API Changes\r\n\r\n- Added a new metric `total-process-cpu-usage` in `SamzaContainerMetrics` which is similar with [how we provided `physical-memory-mb` metric](https://github.com/apache/samza/pull/1530)\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\n\r\n- Unit tests\r\n- Tested with `samza-hello-samza` and verify the metric data points\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-10-25 at 10 23 58

For some Samza jobs, the size of the diagnostic stream partition grows to be large and can cause issues in system streams like Kafka\r\n\r\nCause:\r\nCurrently, diagnostics topics for Samza jobs are created with a single partition. \r\nBecause it is created in DiagnosticsUtil and uses the default partition count, which is 1.\r\nThere could be a need to increase the partition count of the diagnostic stream to resolve the issue above. \r\nHowever, Samza currently uses hostnames as partition key to distribute diagnostic msgs.  The host names can be very similar, the hash of these in the partition key will not evenly distribute the msgs across partitions.\r\n\r\nChange: \r\nUse the “null” partition key instead of using the hostname as the partition key, and leverage on  Kafka default partitioner to evenly distributed the events across partitions.\r\nNote that this change is backward compatible with the default partition count (1) since every msg goes to the same partition regardless of the partition key.\r\n\r\nAPI changes: None\r\n\r\nBackward compatible: No. Note that the change will be backwards incompatible only when the diagnostic stream has more than one partition. The default creation for diagnostic stream inside samza is with 1 partition, but there are cases that the stream pre-exists or partition count increased after creation.\r\n\r\nTest Done:\r\n./gradlew

PR is a part of the Pipeline Drain work and aims to improve `DrainUtils.writeDrainNotification` method which writes drain notifications to the metadata store. Currently, an external controller needs to supply the deployment id (runId).  The controller needs to have the knowledge of the current runId. For draining the current job, we should be able to retrieve the runId from the metadata store so it is not necessary for the caller of `DrainUtils.writeDrainNotification` to supply a runId for the current deployment.\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n\r\n- Add a new method `DrainUtils.writeDrainNotification` which just takes the metadata store as the parameter. In cluster based deployments, configs (including the runId of a job) are written to the metadata store prior to starting the Job Coordinator.

The current Samza Project does not support running in a Java 11 runtime environment. It will continue to build this project with Java 8, however.\r\n\r\nChanges: \r\n1. Update the README to accurately reflect how this project now operates with Java 8 and Java 11.\r\n2. Changes some required things to the run-class to get it to run in a Java 11 environment. \r\n3. Adds a new `samza-yarn3` and `samza-shell-yarn3` project to support people wanting to run in Java 11 environments with the required Yarn version of 3.3.+ (which is when Yarn started supporting Java 11). \r\n4. Upgrades Gradle to V6, everything seems to work fine with the upgrade\r\n5. Various import changes moving to `org.apache.commons.lang3`\r\n\r\nTests: \r\n\r\n1. Ran all tests in this project using both Java 11 and Java 8.\r\n2. Locally published these changes and ran with the updated Hello Samza application with both Java 8 and Java 11 using Yarn 3.3.4 and the `samza-yarn3` module. \r\n\r\nAPI Changes: None\r\n\r\nUpgrade Instructions: All current users of Samza should be able to continue using Samza as usual, there is nothing required for upgrading to this new version.\r\n\r\nUsage Instructions: If you want to use Java 11, then you should make use of the `samza-yarn3` and `samza-shell-yarn3` modules.
