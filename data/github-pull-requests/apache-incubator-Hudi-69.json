What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors the table upgrade and downgrade actions in hudi-client module to extract common logic and reduce LoC.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Moves all common logic of table upgrade and downgrade actions to hudi-client-common package.\r\n- Keeps engine-specific logic in implementations of the new interface `BaseUpgradeDowngradeHelper` in Spark (`SparkUpgradeDowngradeHelper`) and Flink (`FlinkUpgradeDowngradeHelper`) upgrade and downgrade packages.  Two methods are added in the helper:\r\n  - `getPartitionColumns()`: getting the partition columns String from the write config.\r\n  - `getTable()`: getting a new Hudi table for upgrade and downgrade actions.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests around upgrade and downgrade actions.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the `HoodieData` abstraction for the hudi-common and hudi-client modules, to hide the actual engine-specific data structures such as Spark JavaRDD and Flink/Java List.  The `HoodieData` abstraction intends to be the data structure used in the write pipeline for generality.\r\n\r\nUsing the `HoodieData` abstraction, the PR also refactors the compaction actions in hudi-client module to extract common write logic, reduce LoC, and keep only divergent engine-specific logic in the corresponding engine client packages.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Introduces `HoodieData` abstraction for a data collection of objects in type T to store the reference of actual collection data structure use, such as JavaRDD and List.  The `HoodieData` abstraction intends to be the data structure used in the write pipeline for generality.  Chained transformation, e.g., map, flatMap, can be applied on `HoodieData` instances.\r\n  - Creates `HoodieList` based on Java List implementation and `HoodieJavaRDD` based on Spark JavaRDD implementation. \r\n  - Adds new methods `emptyHoodieData()` to create empty `HoodieData` and `parallelize()` to generate `HoodieData`from input List in `HoodieEngineContext`.\r\n- Adds `HoodieAccumulator` abstraction for the accumulator on counts.\r\n  - Creates `HoodieAtomicLongAccumulator` based on Java `AtomicLong` implementation and `HoodieSparkLongAccumulator` based on Spark `LongAccumulator` implementation. \r\n  - Adds new methods `newAccumulator()` to create new `HoodieAccumulator` according to the engine in `HoodieEngineContext`.\r\n- Refactors compaction actions and keeps only engine-specific compaction logic in engine hudi client package.\r\n  - Extracts common logic into `RunCompactionActionExecutor`, `ScheduleCompactionActionExecutor`, `HoodieCompactor`, and `CompactHelpers`.\r\n  - Adds `HoodieCompactionHandler` interface for `handleUpdate()` and `handleInsert()` operations in compaction.\r\n  - Keeps Spark and Flink specific compaction logic in `HoodieSparkMergeOnReadTableCompactor` and `HoodieFlinkMergeOnReadTableCompactor`, respectively, which are the only classes in engine-specific hudi client package.\r\n  - For compaction (`compact()`) in `HoodieFlinkWriteClient`, uses `table.compact()` to invoke compaction logic, which uses `RunCompactionActionExecutor` to execute compaction with the common logic, instead of relying on the deleted class `FlinkCompactHelpers`.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests around compaction.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n*The purpose of this PR is to provide a fix in the issue described in [ISSUE-3709](https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/3709). Specifically, when using INSERT mode the library should not pre-combine input dataset if precombine is deactivated.*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - *Modify HoodieConcatHandle so it does not use an underlying Map to store incoming records. The Map is not really needed in this case; the key lookup is avoided, since merge is simply a concatenation of the old with new records.*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added org.apache.hudi.functional.TestCOWDataSourceConsistentInserts to verify the change.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nHive Sync configs in `HoodieDeltaStreamer` are set via `DataSourceUtils#buildHiveSyncConfig`, which did not set the sync mode even when it was passed. This caused the hive sync to take JDBC or HiveQL executor route instead of directly usins HMS APIs even when the `sync_mode` was set to `hms`. This PR fixes that issue.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- Timeline is not refreshed before every operation. With enabling metadata, some operations could fail if not refreshed. \r\n- Without enabling metadata, this will not be an issue since following operations anyways will list the fs to fetch values, which is not the case with metadata table. \r\n- this fix will be required with continuous mode in deltastreamer when metadata is enabled.  \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added refresh of timeline before every operation.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Enabled metadata for TestHoodieSparkMergeOnReadTableInsertUpdateDelete to verify the fix. w/o the fix, the test fails. \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n -

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis is an extension of the work done in #3595 . Apart from addressing comments in that patch, this PR adds the following changes:\r\n1. APIs in `HoodieTestTable` to work with log files and do several operations like cluster, rollback, savepoint.\r\n2. Refactor `validateMetadata` APIs and move it to `HoodieClientTestHarness` for better reusability.\r\n3. Rewrite all the existing tests in `TestHoodieBackedMetadata` using `HoodieTestTable` APIs and thus doing away with the use of `SparkRDDWriteClient`.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests in `TestHoodieBackedMetadata`.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nInstead of using Json based payloads for the control protocol across Coordinator and Participants, this PR switches to using Protobuf instead for proper evolution of the protocol. In addition, we get rid of a couple of interface methods enforcing throwing IOExceptions. And add log4j to ensure debug logs while running the kafka connect.\r\n \r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. Protobuf for control protocol.\r\n2. Remove throwing exceptions in interface.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nTested with kafka, ZK and confluent schema registry locally.

is a spark action, when executor is crashed by accident and the cache of `JavaRDD<WriteStatus>` is lost, so that this collect action will trigger a complete compute and **create unexpected  data files.**\r\n\r\nWhat's worse marker is already performed which means this corrupts couldn't be deleted automatically.\r\n.\r\n\r\nWe should use `Option<HoodieCommitMetadata> commitMetadata` to do handle errors work instead.\r\n<img width=\"1665\" alt=\"屏幕快照 2021-09-14 下午9 38 45\"

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request enables Apache Hudi to do GitHub Actions actions/setup-java against the latest JDK 8 version (as was the case before this pull request) as well as a fixed JDK 8 version. This is useful because if you do a build and the fixed JDK 8 version is green (it succeeded), while the latest JDK 8 version is red (it failed), that gives you information about the reason for the build failure: it was because of something to do with the latest JDK 8 and not something connected directly to your code.\r\n\r\nYou were using 'adopt', which is no more, 'temurin' and 'zulu' are the two officially supported options, 'temurin' is new and doesn't yet have all/as many versions as 'zulu' does, which is older and therefore has a longer history applicable to this. Hence changed from 'adopt' to 'zulu'.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Make a change anywhere and commit or provide a pull request.*\r\n  - *The actions/setup-java will do two builds, i.e., against two different JDK 8 versions.*\r\n  - *Both will/should go green..*\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-14T14:45:12Z","updated_at":"2021-09-21T11:37:57Z","closed_at":"2021-09-21T11:37:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"020abb68d65818eab1a73bcdcb8292613843c99d","assignee":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/3659/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/3659/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3659/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/9faeecc79ebc0226d0e3a4140147f10a678532f2","head":{"label":"geertjanw:master","ref":"master","sha":"9faeecc79ebc0226d0e3a4140147f10a678532f2","user":{"login":"geertjanw","id":5309985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDk5ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5309985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw","html_url":"https://github.com/geertjanw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertjanw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"9735f4b8efaa3d333e496c1159bd9ae0b222519a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":76474200,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NjQ3NDIwMA==","name":"hudi","full_name":"apache/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https:

Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nAfter stress testing with Kafka (MSK), confluent schema registry and scripts to generate the kafka records, this PR contains all fixes:\r\n\r\n1.When hudi writer fails, the participant sends an empty List, instead throw retryable exception\r\n2. In coordinator, shutdown scheduler to ensure the old coordinator is properly cleaned up during re-assignement\r\n3. Connect calls 2 APIs: put() and preCommit(). We run the complete state machine for both the APIs, that may reset the kafka offset if its not in sync with the coordinator. Resetting the offset when preCommit is called is causing issues in the following cases: Run the connect sink with data in the kafka and wait for a hudi commit. Then kill the worker and restart it. After a START_COMMIT, then start another worker and after sometime. We see the following problem: the tasks in the first worker are killed and all tasks are assigned to the second worker. The issue was that when preCommit is called, we reset the offset (by calling context.offset) and that causes the task to crash. => The fix is to not process the state machine when preCommit is called. The connect platform calls PUT even when the kafka consumer is paused. Hence, we can only rely on PUT API to execute the state machine, and avoid running the state machine on preCommit calls, instead jut return the latest kafka offsets in preCommit API call.\r\n4. Fix logging (log4j was getting imported twice).\r\n5. Fix the script to generate the kafka records, reusing the docker demo json payloads.\r\n6. Fix the README accordingly.\r\n7. Fix the toString conversion of ControlEvent.\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-14T04:46:35Z","updated_at":"2021-09-14T14:14:59Z","closed_at":"2021-09-14T14:14:59Z","merged_at":"2021-09-14T14:14:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"9735f4b8efaa3d333e496c1159bd9ae0b222519a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/3656/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/3656/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3656/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/67ff0ed3c61a9239f0b648a13f2477c2b33c0fe4","head":{"label":"rmahindra123:rm_kafka_connect_fixes","ref":"rm_kafka_connect_fixes","sha":"67ff0ed3c61a9239f0b648a13f2477c2b33c0fe4","user":{"login":"rmahindra123","id":76502047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NTAyMDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76502047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123","html_url":"https://github.com/rmahindra123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":378505943,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzg1MDU5NDM=","name":"hudi","full_name":"rmahindra123/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rmahindra123","id":76502047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NTAyMDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76502047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123","html_url":"https://github.com/rmahindra123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rmahindra123/hudi","description":"Upserts,

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- Adding rollback plan and rollback requested instant. \r\n- We are introducing RollbackPlanning phase which will collect all file info that needs to be deleted as part of the rollback action. This HoodieRollBackPlan will get serialized into commitInstant.rollback.requested. \r\n  - As of of this, adding a new scheduleRollback() method to the HoodieTable. Any rollback, should first schedule and then trigger actual rollback. \r\n```\r\n  public abstract Option<HoodieRollbackPlan> scheduleRollback(HoodieEngineContext context,\r\n                                                              String instantTime,\r\n                                                              HoodieInstant instantToRollback,\r\n                                                              boolean skipTimelinePublish);\r\n```\r\n- During rollback action phase, state is transitioned to inflight and the original rollback plan will be used. In this action phase, no listing or marker based fetch is performed. All we do in this phase is, fetch all file info to be deleted from serialized rollback plan and delete them. For log file deletions, we make appends to log files. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added a new avro model for RollbackPlan (which contains a list of HoodieRollbackRequests). \r\n- Rollback strategy interface is changes as below. \r\n```\r\n  interface RollbackStrategy extends Serializable {\r\n    /**\r\n     * Fetch list of {@link HoodieRollbackRequest}s to be added to rollback plan.\r\n     * @param instantToRollback instant to be rolled back.\r\n     * @return list of {@link HoodieRollbackRequest}s to be added to rollback plan\r\n     */\r\n    List<HoodieRollbackRequest> getRollbackRequest(HoodieInstant instantToRollback);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n- As part of this change, RollBackStrategy is moved from RollbackActionExecutor to RollbackPlanExecutor. Also, have added separate strategy class for Listing bases strategy. \r\n- Classes added or modified relating to Planning phase\r\n    - `BaseRollbackPlanActionExecutor` : Create the Rollback plan (leveraging the right strategy) and serialize into rollback.requested meta file. \r\n         - Inherited by SparkCOW/SparkMORRollbackPlanActionExecutor, FlinkCOW/FlinkMORRollbackPlanActionExecutor, and JavaCOWRollbackPlanActionExecutor. \r\n    - AbstractMarkerBasedRollbackStrategy and ListingBasedRollbackStrategy implements BaseRollbackPlanActionExecutor.RollbackStrategy. \r\n      - ListingBased: SparkCOW/SparkMORListingBasedRollbackStrategy, FlinkCOW/FlinkMORListingBasedRollbackStrategy and JavaCOWListingBasedRollbackStrategy.\r\n      - BaseMarkerBasedRollbackStrategy(used by both Flink and Java) and SparkMarkerBasedRollbackStrategy\r\n- Classes modified for rollback action phase: \r\n   - BaseRollbackActionExecutor: where the actual rollback happens.\r\n      - BaseCopyOnWriteRollbackActionExecutor(used by all 3 engines) and BaseMergeOnReadRollbackActionExecutor (used by all 3 engines)\r\n          - Spark/Flink/JavaCOWRollbackActionExecutor and Spark/FlinkMORRollbackActionExecutor\r\n    - Have added RollbackHelper classes to re-use code as much as possible across all 3 engines. \r\n       - BaseRollbackHelpers: Spark/Flink/JavaRollbackHelper\r\n       - Spark/Java/FlinkListingBasedRollbackHelper classes contains methods used in listing based rollback strategy. \r\n- Have fixed upgrade classes to also use the new approach\r\n- Fixed all existing tests relating to rollback to invoke both rollbackPlan followed by rollback action. \r\n- Tracking few follow ups here https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-2422\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup

As commented, this is a Hive bug (HIVE-22438), but we should resolve it as many users are using Hive less than version 3.0.0. Unfortunately, #972 dose not completely walk around this bug. In #972, we correct `hive.io.file.readcolumn.ids` with a right string,  i.e. '2,0,1', but  this config will be reset with a wrong ',2,0,1' (ref: HIVE-22438) when run on Tez.\r\n\r\nreproduce env:\r\n- hudi: 0.8.0\r\n- hive: 2.3.7\r\n- tez: 0.9.2\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nExecute `hbase-server` and `hbase-client` dependency in Hudi-presto-bundle.\r\nAdd `hbase-shaded-client` and `hbase-shaded-server` in Hudi-presto-bundle.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nAccording to current hudi master branch, Hudi support metadata table feature which is an internal MOR table. Also metadata table uses HFile as its' base file, which means will introduce HBase related dependcies.\r\n\r\nAlthough hudi-presto-bundle's pom.xml already shaded guava but maybe did not take care of the dependencies between HBase and guava. So that we need hbase-shaded-server here.\r\n\r\nWithout this, presto is throwing NoSuchMethodError when querying with metadata table enable.\r\n```\r\n2021-09-08T16:22:21.089+0800\tINFO\tpool-54-thread-1\tcache-stats\t[cache: projector-compiler:hoover]  request: 0, hit: 0/1.00, miss: 0/0.00, loadTime: 0.00ms, eviction:
