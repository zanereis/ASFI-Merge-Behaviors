finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

Description ##\r\nadd op: insert\r\nONLY forward\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

$JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge,

The fix involved-\r\n\r\n1. Renaming the build flag used by maven (namely `USE_NVRTC`) to the name used by the pip builds (`ENABLE_CUDA_RTC`).  The Makefile currently looks at ENABLE_CUDA_RTC (not USE_NVRTC) and in response sets the compile flag MXNET_ENABLE_CUDA_RTC=1 and adds `-lcuda -lnvrtc` to the LDFLAGS.  It was the absence of these ld flags when creating im2rec that caused the issue filed.\r\n\r\n2. Adding compile guards to the newly-introduced files  ./src/operator/fusion/* in a form similar to those that protect ./src/common/rtc.cc.  Now both cuda runtime-compilation facilities are included into the build (or not) based on MXNET_ENABLE_CUDA_RTC.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove

Description ##\r\nShould fix [16833](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16833)\r\n@pengzhao-intel @ZhennanQin @TaoLv @reminisce\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nCurrently type/shape inference of the operator is only called if the values of input and output attributes are not currently known. This is a bug as it may lead to some operators never seeing the values of those inputs/outputs attributes during InferAttr pass and so never validating them.\r\n\r\nAs an example, this code snippet runs without throwing any exception in current MXNet:\r\n```\r\nv = mx.sym.Variable('V')\r\ns = mx.sym.transpose(v)\r\nx = mx.sym.Variable('x')\r\ns2 = x + v\r\ns3 = s + s2\r\ne = s3.simple_bind(ctx=mx.cpu(), x=(2,3), grad_req='null')\r\n```\r\nand it errors out only when calling `e.forward` (in 1.5.1, in 1.6.0 new 2D transpose implementation removed the check for shape inside the forward function of the operator so it does not error out even then). This is because the `transpose` node is early in the topologically sorted graph and ran its shape inference earlier (on unknown input and output shapes) than the `_Plus` operators, which then set all of the shapes by themselves, which prevented `transpose` from running its shape inference again to spot that they are not suitable for this operator. \r\n\r\nIn this PR, I track which operators are actually finished inferring attributes (including validating the attributes they got if all of the inputs/outputs are already known at the point of running their attribute inference).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Currently I check that the operator finished inferring attributes if all input and output attributes are set after the call to operator's InferShape/InferType. This should not be necessary as those functions return the value that should be equivalent. However, since this value was never actually checked, there are a lot of operators that lie and return `true` even if not everything was inferred correctly. This should be tackled in a separate

Description ##\r\nMKL-DNN library is renaming to DNNL since its v1.1 release. APIs are backward compatible but we still need handle header names for distribution. More soft links are added to `include/mkldnn/`.\r\n\r\nReference: https://intel.github.io/mkl-dnn/dev_guide_transition_to_dnnl.html\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-15T06:24:52Z","updated_at":"2019-11-25T11:22:44Z","closed_at":"2019-11-25T11:22:44Z","merged_at":"2019-11-25T11:22:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"ca76bf11c8f085266384952c47a0c45cc633e6c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16823/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16823/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16823/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/4a250e984e7431ae675db1794184f638d3e12dfe","head":{"label":"TaoLv:update-mkldnn-v1.1","ref":"update-mkldnn-v1.1","sha":"4a250e984e7431ae675db1794184f638d3e12dfe","user":{"login":"TaoLv","id":22437510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22437510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv","html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":113452572,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTM0NTI1NzI=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"TaoLv/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"ow

The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-15T00:03:11Z","updated_at":"2019-11-15T05:12:14Z","closed_at":"2019-11-15T05:12:14Z","merged_at":"2019-11-15T05:12:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"4a27b5c32b1f75f3101f4aeccbf186775aeb0151","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16819/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16819/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16819/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/57c4c8d6f23e3744b7c52af4c70093c5c85dde2c","head":{"label":"sxjscience:fix_ctx_context","ref":"fix_ctx_context","sha":"57c4c8d6f23e3744b7c52af4c70093c5c85dde2c","user":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44923569,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDkyMzU2OQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"sxjscience/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience/mxnet","description":"

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\nFix Makefile.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-14T20:49:17Z","updated_at":"2019-11-15T05:42:41Z","closed_at":"2019-11-15T00:10:34Z","merged_at":"2019-11-15T00:10:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"b972406979ba4e94d75cdf49392880e58eb3f14e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16814/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16814/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16814/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/077e9cc67a1ba49f818c42230f88648a452c540c","head":{"label":"sxjscience:fix_tvm_clean","ref":"fix_tvm_clean","sha":"077e9cc67a1ba49f818c42230f88648a452c540c","user":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44923569,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDkyMzU2OQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"sxjscience/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience/mxnet","description":"

Description ##\r\ngluon.contrib.estimator used a global Logger obtained via\r\n`logging.getLogger('gluon.contrib.estimator.event_handlers')`. This logger used\r\nto be configured every time a gluon.contrib.estimator.LoggingHandler was\r\ncreated, which is a bug. We can't modify a global Logger instance whenever the\r\nuser creates an Estimator and a LoggingHandler.\r\n\r\nInstead, this commit separates the LoggingHandler (responsible for logging\r\nmetadata during estimator.fit) from the configuration of the Logger.\r\n\r\nWe expose the Logger as attribute of the Estimator, and configure it to output\r\nto stdout by default. Instructions are given how users can configure the\r\nEstimator.logger to log to a file instead.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This change is backward incompatible, but is important to make. It only changes experimental APIs. The reason is that the previous API design is inconsistent and not user friendly. It is inconsistent, because a global object is modified whenever a `LoggingHandler` object is created; this leads to buggy behaviour if the user creates multiple `LoggingHandler`s, as all of them will share the same underlying Python Logger. Instead, we should use a separate logger for each estimator.\r\n- This change improves usability, by switching the default log stream from `sys.stderr` to `sys.stdout`. The following screenshot highlights the need for this.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/946903/68449878-d5a9b000-0223-11ea-912e-f3bf8e25da76.png)\r\n\r\nCompare this to

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

Description ##\r\nadd op bitwise_or\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\nThe flakiness in #16415 was caused by a typo in LaOpDetBackward, which resulted in array index out of bound. The reason it only happened on Windows and was susceptible to the presence of call to broadcast in slogdet_backward may have something to do with the Windows Release image stack memory layout. I guess the Linux binary was simply a bit more tolerant.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with

Description ##\r\nFixes #16785.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds additional `symbol_` member to `GraphExecutor`, which contains the unoptimized symbol used by this executor. That symbol is then passed to the child executors when calling `Reshape` instead of the forward portion of the already optimized graph. This prevents a failure that would happen when the forward portion of the already optimized version of the symbol (with operators like `_FusedOp` which do not have `FGradient` method, as they are supposed to work on full graph) is passed to the new executor and the new executor tries to construct the full graph out of it.\r\n\r\n@roywei @samskalicky FYI, please validate that this PR fixes the issue with Keras-MXNet integration.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n - This is a quick fix for the issue, but the right approach in the longer term would be to change the `Reshape` function in the executor to fully share the graph between the executor and its children instead of sharing only a forward portion of it and relying on the child executor to create the entire graph out of it - it is wasteful to recreate the full graph every time to do a simple reshape.\r\n - Subgraph API, since most of its logic sits inside `Bind`/`SimpleBind`, cannot be recreated from the unoptimized symbol. Since Subgraph API is used only for inference, it does not expose this issue. In order to not break the Subgraph API after reshape the `symbol_` field is populated with the symbol after building the

spotted (which I believe was previously fixed during the process of working on the fusion PR, but I guess some merge undid it) - the FusedOp did not recompile the code when there was a change of inputs/outputs number of dimensions, which is wrong.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes both of those problems and introduces tests for them. \r\n@sxjscience Please validate the

Description ##\r\n- We implemented functions for image rotation and random rotation in mxnet.image.image.py, a transform for Rotation and one for RandomRotation in mxnet.gluon.data.vision.transforms.py\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n\r\n- [x] The PR refers to the relevant issues #13206 #11230\r\n- [x] Changes are complete \r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- Unit tests are added for both mxnet.image.image.py functions and for mxnet.gluon.data.vision.transforms.py \r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Image rotation function `imrotate`, based on BilinearSampler function. Tested in tests/python/unittest/test_image.py\r\n- [x] transforms.Rotate, tested in tests/python/unittest/test_gluon_data_vision.py\r\n- [x] Image random rotation function `random_rotate`. Tested in tests/python/unittest/test_image.py\r\n- [x] transforms.RandomRotation, tested in tests/python/unittest/test_gluon_data_vision.py\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nAll the implemented functionalities are based on `imrotate` function. The shape of the output of this function is the same shape of the input, thus it can be used inside a transformer.\r\nIt supports 3 behaviors:\r\n- Simple image rotation without zooming\r\n![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/1m4P6wr/no-zoom.png \"Simple Rotation\")\r\n- Zoom in image rotation: no padding is shown in the output result\r\n![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/JyCK6GQ/zoom-in.png \"Rotation with zoom in\")\r\n- Zoom out image rotation: the whole original image will be contained in the output result\r\n![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/tPhLKvT/zoom-out.png \"Rotation with zoom in\")\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-12T17:06:10Z","updated_at":"2020-02-11T01:13:58Z","closed_at":"2020-02-11T01:13:29Z","merged_at":"2020-02-11T01:13:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"6c61afbc10efd0c40be1977ad22b5ec016d694fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nAs title.\r\nDone through casting the `lhs` or `rhs` values to the same type and fallback to existing implementations.\r\nNot implemented for cases where both inputs are integers, since that case backward is not meaningful.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] BackwardUseIn for multiply op\r\n- [x] Unittest coverage\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nLimited support for the sake of d2l, benchmark results yet to come.\r\nMore to come for UseNone in the future.","created_at":"2019-11-12T11:43:47Z","updated_at":"2019-11-20T23:16:00Z","closed_at":"2019-11-20T23:15:59Z","merged_at":"2019-11-20T23:15:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"7c9cb6b7feebcb75465074f68fd97f81c19e2c2c","assignee":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1630817629,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjMwODE3NjI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/R1.6.0","name":"R1.6.0","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16791/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16791/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16791/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/5139bd59a46197260032cddefb590ca0cee66d4f","head":{"label":"haojin2:mixed_precision_binary_bwd","ref":"mixed_precision_binary_bwd","sha":"5139bd59a46197260032cddefb590ca0cee66d4f","user":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114436356,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQ0MzYzNTY=","

Description ##\r\nAs title.\r\nPlus some refactors to reduce calls to `mshadow::Stream<gpu>::GetStream()`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] API Migration from `cudaMemcpy` to `cudaStreamSynchronize`\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\naddress

remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add polyval and tests\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- TODO: add float16

Description ##\r\nPyPI CD pipeline is [failing](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/restricted-mxnet-cd%2Fmxnet-cd-release-job/detail/mxnet-cd-release-job/145/pipeline) - it seems base.py should be made python2 compatible. The call to open with encoding is breaking compatibility. This PR makes that update. A successful run on dev can be seen [here](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci-dev.amazon-ml.com/job/restricted-mxnet-cd/job/mxnet-cd-release-job/394/console).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-12T08:00:08Z","updated_at":"2019-11-18T13:55:31Z","closed_at":"2019-11-18T13:54:22Z","merged_at":"2019-11-18T13:54:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"94e7ba76986e87ad63cde2db3bc2065b824c40fa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16787/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16787/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16787/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/06741f1fdcbc3fd1a8b5b98b78404e23f8ac870e","head":{"label":"perdasilva:cd_pypi_fix","ref":"cd_pypi_fix","sha":"06741f1fdcbc3fd1a8b5b98b78404e23f8ac870e","user":{"login":"perdasilva","id":785683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NTY4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/785683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva","html_url":"https://github.com/perdasilva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":143983733,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDM5ODM3MzM=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"perdasilva/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"perdasilva","id":785683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NTY4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/785683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva","html_url":"https://github.com/perdasilva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/perdasilva/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nThis PR speeds up the dynamic nvrtc-compilation of fused_ops in response to @rondogency's comment https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15167#issuecomment-550008831.  As reported in the comment, the runtime of 3 mentioned unittests had grown drastically with the fusion enabled to 17.5 minutes in total.  With this PR, the runtime drops to 1 minute, with the original fusion-turned-off runtime being 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe process of runtime compilation of NVIDIA gpu kernels involves 2 steps:\r\n    - compiling the cuda code to PTX assembly (performed once per GPU architecture)\r\n    - translating the ptx assembly to binary and loading it into a GPU's set of runnable kernels (performed once per GPU device).  This latter step produces the CUfunction needed to execute the kernel on the device.\r\n\r\nAfter realizing that the slowed-down unittests were creating many identical fused ops, I added a cache of the PTX and CUfunctions.  The cache comprises a mapping (for each GPU arch) from the cuda source code to the PTX and to any CUfunctions created from it.\r\n\r\nIt's worth a reminder that the fusion framework is targeting the typical scenario of creating a model's graph and executing it many times.  The CI was adversely impacted because it often executes a model's graph just once after creation.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your

Description ##\r\nFixes #16747.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes 2 problems:\r\n - the name for the fused op on the backward pass contained names of nodes in the forward pass, sometimes making the name excessively long. This happened because backward nodes had control dependencies to corresponding forward nodes and `DFSVisit` (used to generate the FusedOp name) traverses those edges as well.\r\n - under some circumstances (including the ones in #16747) backward node inside a FusedOp could have multiple nodes listed in control dependencies (instead of just a single one - the corresponding forward node). FusedOp would then take all of them and treat them as nodes required for type and shape inference. If any of such unnecessary nodes was another backward node that was subsequently fused, such control dependency would be changed into a Helper node, which does not exist in the IndexedGraph, causing an error during `ProvideAttrToFusion` call. This PR changes the behavior so that only the first control dependency (real forward node) is taken into account when constructing control dependencies of the fusion node.\r\n\r\n## Checklist

Description ##\r\nI noticed a bug with `abs()` on NDArray objects.  Perl understood enough to treat them as numbers, but not well enough to correctly calculate absolute values of them properly.  Distinct from Python, Perl has a set of overloadable core math functions, and I think it's prudent to handle them similar to PDL.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-11T16:23:30Z","updated_at":"2019-11-11T21:23:32Z","closed_at":"2019-11-11T21:23:31Z","merged_at":"2019-11-11T21:23:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"27672b99000df92f18c199bdfca48370f426b978","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16779/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16779/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16779/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/67814e3f46ddba3b4397bff641b8155217ff456f","head":{"label":"tlby:abs-overload-fix","ref":"abs-overload-fix","sha":"67814e3f46ddba3b4397bff641b8155217ff456f","user":{"login":"tlby","id":3189927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODk5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3189927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlby","html_url":"https://github.com/tlby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":82883702,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4Mjg4MzcwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"tlby/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tlby","id":3189927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODk5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3189927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlby","html_url":"https://github.com/tlby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tlby/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThis change adds the unfold tensor operator equivalent to the same operator in pytorch[1]. This operator helps in implementing new local attention-based neural network layers.\r\n\r\nUnfold returns a tensor which contains all slices of a given kernel size from the input tensor in the given dimension. Step between two slices is given by stride.\r\n\r\nIf sizedim is the size of target dimension for the input, the size of the same dimension in the returned tensor will be (sizedim - kernel_size) / stride + 1.\r\n\r\nAn additional dimension of size size is appended in the returned tensor.\r\n\r\n[1] https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html#torch.Tensor.unfold\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n###

Description ##\r\ngluon.contrib.estimator uses a Logger shared between all event handlers that is\r\nobtained via logging.getLogger(gluon.contrib.estimator.event_handlers). This\r\nlogger used to be configured when creating a\r\ngluon.contrib.estimator.LoggingHandler. This configuration was inconsistent,\r\nbecause each time a LoggingHandler was created, the global Logger was modified.\r\n\r\nInstead, this commit clearly separates the LoggingHandler (responsible for\r\nlogging to the Logger during estimator.fit) from the configuration of the\r\nLogger (which users can do via the introduced getLogger API).\r\n\r\nFurther, there was previously no way for user-defined EventHandlers to log to\r\nthe correct Logger instance.\r\n\r\nWe also disable log handler propagation by default and change the default log\r\nstream for gluon estimator to sys.stdout.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Introduce `gluon.contrib.estimator.getLogger` API for users to configure and obtain the logger class used by gluon estimator. This supersedes configuring the logger by adding constructor arguments to `gluon.contrib.estimator.LoggingHandler`, as the logger is a global object and it does not make sense to configure it as part of a class constructor (of which we can expect some users to create multiple objects during a sessione.)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This change is backward incompatible, but is important to make. It only changes experimental APIs. The reason is that the previous API design is inconsistent and not user friendly. It is inconsistent, because a global object is modified whenever a `LoggingHandler` object is created; this leads to buggy behaviour if the user creates multiple `LoggingHandler`s, as all of them will share the same underlying Python Logger. Instead, we must make it explictit that the same Logger is used.\r\n- This change improves usability, by switching the default log stream from `sys.stderr` to `sys.stdout`. The following screenshot highlights the need for this. Users can change this default by modifying the logger returned by the `getLogger` API, if needed.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/946903/68449878-d5a9b000-0223-11ea-912e-f3bf8e25da76.png)\r\n\r\nCompare this to

Description ##\r\nFix SliceChannel Type Inference. Do forward and backward inference for slice channel with ElemwiseAttr logic. Remove exception thrown from infer_type logic in slice channel.\r\nAdds some gluoncv models to AMP examples.\r\n\r\n@ptrendx \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge,

correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Unit tests\r\n- [x] Numpy-compatible GCD operator\r\n\r\n##

Description ##\r\nThis PR advances the 3rdparty dmlc-core submodule by the following 2 commits:\r\n```\r\nca9f932  2019-11-05  Dick Carter            Fix initial-release nvcc v10.1 issue with thread_local.h (#579)\r\n05fb5ad  2019-10-24  Philip Hyunsu Cho      Make yarn.py and launcher.py compatible with Python 3 (#564)\r\n```\r\nImportantly, this pulls in dmlc-core PR https://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core/pull/579, which is the work-around for MXNet issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16612.  Once this is merged, an MXNet build against the initial release of cuDNN v10.1 will not fail.  The version of dmlc-core included as a submodule of 3rdparty/tvm will not change of course (it depends on the tvm submodule hash), but this is not causing a compile problem for MXNet.\r\n\r\n@larroy

operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThis PR intends to change MKL-DNN library from dynamic linking to static linking. That will help:\r\n1. Simplify the build, packaging and distribution process;\r\n2. Avoid linkage error during runtime when different versions of MKL-DNN are installed on user's machine.\r\n\r\nThere were other attempts to do so before. But before MKL-DNN v1.0 integrated, it also depends on libmklml_intel.so. So it doesn't make much sense if we only make MKL-DNN static linked and leave libmklml_intel.so outside.\r\n\r\n This PR is also removing a python unit test which was designed to check MKL-DNN install by doing grep against the proc maps to make sure mkldnn.so is linked. After changing to static link, the approach would not work and not needed.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\ntentative PR\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

Description ##\r\nSupport operations between 2 boolean-typed tensors, currently `add`, `multiply` and `true_divide` are supported and tested.\r\nHas quite a few conflict with #16699, suggesting merging #16699 before merging this one. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] boolean elemwise/broadcast binary add, multiply\r\n- [x] unit test for add, multiply and true_divide\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTo support the tuning for `bool` type, `operator_tune`'s `data_set_` buffer is changed to be malloc'd instead of using `std::vector` due to stl's [special implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sequence_container_(C%2B%2B)&oldid=767869909#Specialization_for_bool).\r\n@cjolivier01

reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] op average, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- does not guarantee the same behavior with numpy when given float16 dtype and overflow occurs\r\n- a and weights must be the same

changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\nAlso cut size of softmax operator with new type switch.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to
