Change Logs\r\n\r\nOrigin Issue: https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/8960\r\n\r\nNow we have HoodieMultiTableDeltaStreamer using spark to ingest multi tables into hudi, and we can also ingest multi tables using a single flink in some platforms like alicloud vvp. In such scenario we may want to run all tables services outside of the ingestion job to improve stability.\r\n\r\nCurrently, hudi provides a bunch of offline table service jobs but we still need to run them manually or through some schedule tools. This Pr provides a tool to run all table services in a single spark job\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nprovides a tool to run all table services in a single spark job\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none,

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe are looking to fix two problems by adding per log file marker. \r\na. i. MOR data table rollbacks missed to sync original log files from failed commit to MDT. \r\na.ii. Along these lines, if rollback instant is retried multiple times, any log files added from failed rollback attempts should also be synced to MDT. \r\nb. If there are spurious log files created even w/ successful commits, we need to ensure these spurious log files are also synced to MDT. \r\n\r\nSo, to fix all of the above, we are adding per log file marker. Any log file added or appended to will create markers. We don't really need to distinguish between create and append and so we will go w/ APPEND IoType for markers. \r\n\r\nFix for (a. i): Any log file added will emit a marker. If the commit of interest failed, hudi will trigger a rollback. During rollback planning, using markers we identify the original log files added by the failed commit and track it as part of the rollback plan. This also gets tracked in HoodieRollbackMetadata (had to upgrade the schema for this purpose). \r\n\r\nFix for (a.ii): Whenever a rollback is triggered, hudi adds a rollback command block. With this patch, we are also emitting markers for such log files. During rollback execution, apart from adding log files added by failed commit to HoodieRollbackMetadata, we also add these log files which could have been added by previous attempts of rollback for the same instant. \r\n\r\nFix for (b): During marker based reconciliation step, we check for log files from markers and compare it against HoodieCommitMetadata's HoodieWriteStat. If for any additional files tracked using markers (which could happen due to spark retries), we will add new  HoodieWriteStat and update HoodieCommitMetadata. So, that when this syncs to MDT, we don't miss to track this spurious log files. We will use https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/9545 to skip such spurious log files on the reader side. So, on the writer side, we just want to ensure we don't miss to track any log file created by hudi. \r\n\r\nNote: Please do note that the reconciliation for log files is kind of opposite of what happens w/ data files. w/ data files, any extraneous files are deleted. But for any extaneous log files, we can't afford to delete. Since there could be a concurrent reader trying to read the the file slice of interest. Eventually during execution, it might parse the log block header and might skip if its partially failed commit or inflight commit. Anyways, in short, we can't afford to delete any log files at any point in time except cleaner. So, for any extraneous log files detected, we fix the HoodieCommitMetadata to track these additional log files as well. \r\n\r\nNotes to reviewers to assist in reviewing: \r\n\r\nI will break down diff set of changes and the classes to review for the same. \r\n\r\n1. Adding per log file marker for regular log files: Added a callback(AppendLogWriteCallback) for this purpose since we may not know the log file name upfront (unlike data files). New apis are introduced to Markers for this purpose. \r\nCheck files HoodieWriteHandle, HoodieAppendHandle, HoodieLogFormatWriter, HoodieLogFormat, HoodieLogFileWriterCallback\r\nDirectWriterMarkers, TimelineServerBasedMarkers, WriteMarkers, RequestHandler. \r\n\r\n2. Schema upgrade for rollback metadata. \r\n   Check file HoodieRollbackMetadata.avsc\r\n\r\n3. Rollback from DT when synced to MDT: w/ the schema upgrade, we will fetch \"logFilesFromFailedCommit\" in HoodieRollbackMetadata and make a delta commit to MDT. \r\n HoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter and HoodieTableMetadataUtil.\r\n\r\n4.Rollback plan changes:\r\nWhen using Marker based rollback strategy, we poll markers to find the log files added. Apart from log file names, we also need the actual size. So, we do fs listing to fetch the file lengths. We track these as part of HoodieRollbackRequest.logFilesWithBlocksToRollback. There are chances that some files could be missing which are tracked in markers. We can ignore these files since this could happen (just after creating marker file, lets say the process crashed w/o creating the actual log files)\r\nClasses to check: MarkerBasedRollbackStrategy\r\n\r\n5. New argument to StorageScheme named listStatusUnfriendly. Depending on storage scheme, the file system based listing to triage the actual size of the log files of interest could change. As per this patch, we only have one way to do this. But in a follow up patch, we might have to fix that. \r\n\r\n6. Fixing HoodieCommitMetadata to include HoodieWriteStat for any missing log files which are extraneous through markers. \r\nClasses to check: SparkRDDWriteClient.commit and addMissingLogFileIfNeeded(). This also includes the file system listing to fetch the actual size of spurious log files if any. \r\n\r\n7. Rollback execution: \r\na. With this patch, we are also emitting markers for rollback command blocks (log files). \r\nb. During execution, we also need to fetch any log files added by previous attempts of rollback and update HoodieRollbackSat if need be. Note that we can have only one HoodieRollbackPlan per partition. \r\nClasses: BaseRollbackHelper. \r\n\r\n8. Misc: \r\nHoodiePairData to add join() support. HoodieListPairData, HoodieJavaPairRDD.\r\nFsUtils.getFileStatusesUnderPartition to assist in fetching file statuses for some interested log files. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMDT in sync with filesystem\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nHigh. \r\nMore rigorous testing will be done. \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\n1. Disabling entire MDT after enabling needs some fixes. \r\n2. We do have some special instants times like initialization instant times, compaction, clean etc in MDT timeline. During InstantRange check, these should be considered as valid. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n1. allows users to disable metadata using write configs cleanly. \r\n2. Valid instants consideration while reading from MDT is solid now. We are going to treat any special instant time (that has additional suffix compared to DT's commit time) as valid. \r\n\r\nEspecially with MDT partition initialization, the suffix is dynamic, and so we can't really find exact match. So, might have to go with total instant time length and treat all special instant times as valid ones. \r\n\r\nIn the LogRecordReader, we will first ignore any uncommitted instants. And then if its completed in MDT timeline, we check w/ the instantRange. and so its should be fine to return true for any special instant times. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high

Change Logs\r\n\r\nDue to spark retries, we could have duplicated log blocks added during write. And since, we don't delete any log files during marker based reconciliation on the writer side, the reader could see duplicated log blocks. for most of the payload implementation, this should not be an issue. But for expression payload, it could result in data consistency since an expression could be evaluated twice (for eg, colA*2).\r\n\r\n#### Fix \r\nWith spark retries, there could be duplicate log blocks created. So, we might need to add some kind of block identifier to every block added. Already we have a header with key \"INSTANT_TIME\". In addition we can add \"BLOCK_SEQUENCE_NO\". BlockSequence number is a combination of a simple counter which will increment from 1 and keep increasing during rollover for a given a file slice(append handle) and the attempt number combo. On spark retries, again, we start with sequence no of 1 for a given File slice, but the attempt number would have been incremented by 1. Because, for a given commit and for a given file slice, with spark task or stage retries, entire file slice will be attempted again. so, just block seq no and attempt number would suffice. For eg, if a file slice is supposed to get 3 log files due to log file size rollovers, and during first attempt only 2 log files were created, in 2nd attempt, all 3 log files will have to re-created.\r\n \r\nOn the reader side, if there are duplicate blocks detected with same commit time and same block sequence number, we should find the longest sequence and pick them if more than one sequence is found. And corrupt blocks should be ignored during this reconciliation as well. We should account for backwards compatability where the block seq number may not be present. For rollback blocks, we can statically set the sequence no to 1 since there should be only one log block per file slice.\r\n \r\n\r\n#### Diff scenarios: \r\nAs called out above, we will go with a simple Block_Sequence_No which starts with 0 and increments for a given file slice. Major crux here is, how the reader will reconcile if there are duplicate log files created due to spark task failures. High level logic to reconcile for the reader is as follows: Reader find the longest sequence of BSN(block sequence number) and picks the maximum one. So, we do one pass over every log block (which we already do as of today) to parse header info, w/o deserializing actual content and determine the right ones (and ignore the spurious log blocks)\r\n \r\n\r\n##### Scenario 1:\r\nHappy path. no retries.\r\nlog_file1(BSN : 0), log_file2(BSN:1) added. all of them has attempt No = 0\r\nReader:\r\nfinds only one sequence of 0,1 for BSN and marks both log_file1 and log_file2 as valid.\r\n \r\n\r\n##### Scenario 2:\r\nTask failed and retired, where 1st attempt did not create entire list of log files.\r\nattempt1:\r\nlog_file1(BSN : 0), log_file2(BSN:1) added. attempt No = 0.\r\nattempt2:\r\nlog_file3(BSN : 0), log_file4(BSN:1), log_file5(BSN:2) added. // BSN starts with 0 everytime for a given file slice. attempt No = 1\r\n \r\nReader:\r\nFinds two sequence of Block sequence nos.\r\n{0, (0,1)} and {1, (0,1,2)}. And so chooses lf3, lf4 and lf5 as valid and ignores lf1 and lf2 as spurious ones.\r\n \r\n\r\n##### Scenario 3:\r\nTask failed and retired, where both attempts created full list. (spark speculation may be)\r\nattempt1:\r\nlog_file1(BSN : 0), log_file2(BSN:1) added. attempt No = 0\r\nattempt2:\r\nlog_file3(BSN : 0), log_file4(BSN:1) added. attempt No = 1\r\n \r\nReader:\r\nFinds two sequence of Block sequence nos.\r\n{0, (0,1)} and {1, (0,1)}. And so chooses lf3 and lf4 as valid and ignores lf1 and lf2 as spurious ones. We will probably pick the latest set if both sets have same sequence.\r\n \r\n\r\n##### Scenario 4:\r\nTask failed and retired, where 1st attempt has full list of log files.\r\nattempt1:\r\nlog_file1(BSN : 0), log_file2(BSN:1) added. attempt No = 0\r\nattempt2:\r\nlog_file3(BSN : 0) added. attempt No = 1. \r\n \r\nReader:\r\nFinds two sequence of Block sequence nos.\r\n{0, (0,1)} and {1, (0)|. And so chooses lf1 and lf2 as valid and ignores lf3 as spurious one.\r\n \r\nSame logic should work out for hdfs as well. Since log blocks are ordered as per log file name w/ versions, the ordering should be intact. i.e. log files/log blocks created by 2nd attempt should not interleave w/ log blocks during w/ 1st attempt. If log blocks are within same log file, the log blocks will be ordered for sure. If its across log files, the log version number ordering should suffice (which already happens).\r\n \r\n \r\n##### Scenario 3 with hdfs:\r\nTask failed and retired, where both attempts created full list. (spark speculation may be). but in one of the attempt, there are partial writes(corrupted blocks).\r\nattempt1:\r\nlog_file1, block1(BSN : 0), log_file1, block2(BSN:1), but a corrupt block due to partial write. attempt No = 0.\r\nattempt2:\r\nlog_file1, block3(BSN : 0), log_file2, block4 (BSN:1) added. attempt No = 1\r\n \r\nReader:\r\nFinds two sequence of Block sequence nos.\r\nSince lf1, block2 is a corrupt block, valid sequences deduced are (0) and (0,1). And so we choose lf1, block3 and lf1, block3 as valid and ignores lf1, block1 and lf1, block2 as invalid.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMOR log record reader will never read any duplicated log blocks created due to spark task retries during write. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nRecent refactoring to support batching within commit for GCS incr job moved the filtering of  objects after the checkpoint batching. The issue with this on bootstrap scenarios where we are looking for only latest commits, we will have to go through the entire set of commits based on sourcelimit instead of directly skipping to the latest commit. \r\n\r\nFix is to apply filtering before we start checkpoint batching.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe purpose of [8849](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/8849) change is to fix the ordering of rollbacks such that, the completion of rollback instant happens first followed by commits file removal from the timeline. \r\nFor eg, \r\nif t5.c.inflight is partially failed, and t6.rb.requested is triggered to rollback. \r\ntowards the completion, t6.rb is moved to completed state. and later all t5 commit files are removed from the timeline. \r\nThis could lead to dangling commit files (t5) if the process crashes just after moving the t6 rollback to completion. So, 8849 also introduced polling completed rollbacks and ensure we don't trigger another rollback for t5. \r\n\r\nBut we missed that we already landed [5148](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5148) which was addressing a similar issue. \r\nAs per 5148, we first need to delete the commit files from timeline (t5) and then transition the rollback to completion (t6.rb). So, even if there is a crash, if we re-attempt t6.rb.requested, it will get to completion w/o any issues (even if t5 is not in the timeline at all). \r\nHence reverting some of the core changes added as part of 8849. But there are some tests added and so not reverting the entire patch. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAvoids polling rollback timeline to rollback failed writes. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Add a new `update` method to `HoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter` that works with `HoodieData<HoodieRecord>`.\r\n- Add a `BaseIndexingCatchupTask` with two concrete implementations.\r\n- For record level indexing, `HoodieRecordBasedIndexingCatchupTask` is used.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAsync indexing framework is more extensible, can work based on commit metadata as well as collection of records. Useful for adding record level secondary indexing. Depedning on index type, interface can be implemented to suit different needs.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated

Change Logs\r\n\r\nUpdates the logic for creating the `HoodieTableMetadata` in the `FileSystemViewManager` to be a function of the `HoodieTableMetaClient` instead of simply a supplier. This allows us to use the current basePath instead of using the base path that is available when creating the `FileSystemViewManager` which enables a single view manager to work properly with multiple tables when metadata table is enabled for those tables.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixes bug impacting use of a single timeline server for multiple tables with metadata table enabled for those tables.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow, small risk of changing the signature of a public method for those that may be calling it outside of the Hudi project. Otherwise, all changes are hidden from the user.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\nCloudObjectsSelectorCommon adds config `SPARK_DATASOURCE_READER_COMMA_SEPARATED_PATH_FORMAT` for comma separated path . \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nFor file formats like xml does not support array of strings in spark.read.load() .  \r\ncomma separated path formats are supported for loading data from more than 1 file . \r\nSo this pr adds support for  comma separated path\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn our end-to-end testing, found some mysql debezium records are ignored by Deltastreamer and we lose these updates in hudi tables. e.g. \r\n\r\n```\r\nExisting record in hudi table has _event_seq \"00000.23\"\r\nFor the same record, new update comes with  _event_seq \"00000.123\" (same binlog file, higher position)\r\n\r\n```\r\nHowever, current implementation ignores the update \"00000.123\" since it is using string comparison. This PR fixes the issue by comparing binlog file number and position within binlog file for the record separately. \r\n\r\nUnit test added which fails without the fix included in this PR.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixes the data loss issue for mysql debezium\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\nImplemented a solution to prevent duplicate key errors in concurrent replace commit operations.\r\nRegistered the replace file ID information to the timeline for each replace commit, whether it is submitted or not.\r\nSaved the pending replace commit's partitionToReplaceFileIds information to the inflight commit's extra metadata.\r\nUpdated drop partition and clustering operations to read the partitionToReplaceFileIds information in the timeline to ensure no duplicate file IDs.\r\nRemoved the modification involved in the related issue for compaction commit.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo public API or user-facing feature changes.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nRelated issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-5553\r\n\r\nThe specific problem is that when concurrent replace commit operations are executed, two replace commits may point to the same file ID, resulting in a duplicate key error. The existing issue solved the problem of scheduling delete partition while there are pending clustering or compaction operations, which will be prevented in this case. However, this solution is not perfect and may still cause data inconsistency if a clustering plan is scheduled before the delete partition is committed. Because validation is one-way.In this case, both replace commits will still contain duplicate keys, and the table will become inconsistent when both plans are committed. This is very fatal, and there are other similar scenarios that may bypass the validation of the existing issue. Moreover, the existing issue is at the partition level and is not precise enough.\r\n\r\nHere is my solution:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/47964462/6d8a3134-96a5-45ec-8ed0-ed2776b7ed24)\r\n\r\nAs shown in the figure, both drop partition and clustering will go through a period of time that is not registered to the timeline, which is the scenario that the previous issue did not solve. Here, I register the replace file IDs involved in each replace commit to the active timeline (the replace commit timeline that has been submitted has saved partitionToReplaceFileIds, and only pending requests need to be processed). Since in the case of Spark SQL, delete partition creates a requested commit in advance during write, which is inconvenient to handle, I save the pending replace commit's partitionToReplaceFileIds information to the inflight commit's extra metadata. Therefore, each time drop partition or clustering is executed, it only needs to read the partitionToReplaceFileIds information in the timeline after ensuring that the inflight commit information has been saved to the timeline to ensure that there are no duplicate file IDs and prevent this kind of error from occurring.\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, each replace commit will register the replace file ID information to the timeline whether it is submitted or not, at the same time, each submission will check this information to ensure that it will not be repeated, so that any replace commit containing this file ID will be prevented, ensuring that there are no duplicate keys.\r\n\r\nWhen this idea is also implemented on the compaction commit, the modification involved in the related issue can be

Change Logs\r\n\r\n`StreamerUtil#getTableConfig` only checks whether .hoodie exists at present.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the validation of record index in MDT validator (`HoodieMetadataTableValidator`).  The following validation modes are added:\r\n- Record index count validation (with CLI config `--validate-record-index-count`): validate the number of entries in the record index, which should be equal to the number of record keys in the latest snapshot of the table.\r\n- Record index content validation (with CLI config `--validate-record-index-content`): validate the content of the record index so that each record key should have the correct location, and there is no additional or missing entry.  Two more configs are added for this mode: (1) `--num-record-index-error-samples`: number of error samples to show for record index validation when there are mismatches, (2) `--record-index-parallelism`: parallelism for joining record index entries with data table entries in the validation.\r\n\r\nThe new validation modes are tested on both correct and corrupted record index in MDT.  Here's the example message when the validation of record index content fails, showing the number of record keys that have mismatches and sample mismatches:\r\n```\r\n23/08/14 19:09:32 WARN HoodieMetadataTableValidator: Error closing HoodieMetadataValidationContext, ignoring the error as the validation is successful.\r\norg.apache.hudi.exception.HoodieValidationException: Validation of record index content failed: 317900 keys (total 51082420) from the data table have wrong location in record index metadata.
