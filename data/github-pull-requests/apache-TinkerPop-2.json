parameterization which was added to gremlin-lang in 3.7 has a key limitation as a result of all variables directly resolving to literals as the script is parsed. As such, the existing parameterization does not allow for any optimizations from caching recurring query plans, as may be seen with gremlin-groovy. The primary benefits of the existing parameterization is to offer users additional flexibility and to increase similarity between gremlin-lang and gremlin-groovy.\r\n\r\nThis work extends parameterization beyond gremlin-lang to enable optimizations in cases of users executing repetitive query patterns. To accomplish this, a new class `GValue` is introduced which wraps a parameter name and value. Steps which will benefit from parameterization have been given overloads to accept `GValue`'s. Users can pass GValue's into their traversals to inject parameters. When using the new `DefaultVariableResolver`, the grammar will now resolve variables into GValue which are passed to the constructed traversal, instead of directly resolving them to literals. The old variable resolution behavior can still be obtained via the `DirectVariableResolver`.\r\n\r\nAs GValue has only been explicitly added in places where parameterization is expected to be useful, a corresponding change has been made to the grammar only allow variables in places which will take a

GitHub Action will use the <a href=\"https://github.com/codecov/wrapper\">Codecov Wrapper</a> to encapsulate the <a href=\"https://github.com/codecov/codecov-cli\">CLI</a>. This will help ensure that the Action gets updates quicker.</p>\n<h3>Migration Guide</h3>\n<p>The <code>v5</code> release also coincides with the opt-out feature for tokens for public repositories. In the <code>Global Upload Token</code> section of the settings page of an organization in codecov.io, you can set the ability for Codecov to receive a coverage reports from any source. This will allow contributors or other members of a repository to upload without needing access to the Codecov token. For more details see <a href=\"https://docs.codecov.com/docs/codecov-tokens#uploading-without-a-token\">how to upload without a token</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!WARNING]<br />\n<strong>The following

EOL 30 Apr 2022.</li>\n<li>Remove the minified UMD build from the package.</li>\n<li>Drop support for browsers that don't correctly implement const/let and default arguments, and no longer transpile the browser build to ES2015.</li>\n<li>Although in practice this is currently a noop since the resulting build does not change, the build will no longer transpiles future changes for Node.js 8.x targets, so semantically this is still a breaking change.</li>\n<li>Deep requiring specific algorithms of this library like require('uuid/v4'), which has been deprecated in uuid@7, is no longer supported.</li>\n<li>The default export, which used to be the v4() method but which was already discouraged in v3.x of this library, has been removed.</li>\n<li>Explicitly note that deep imports of the different uuid version functions are deprecated and no longer encouraged and that ECMAScript module named imports should be used instead. Emit a deprecation warning for people who deep-require the different algorithm variants.</li>\n<li>Remove builtin support for insecure random number generators in the browser. Users who want that will have to supply their own random number generator function.</li>\n<li>Remove support for generating v3 and v5 UUIDs in Node.js&lt;4.x</li>\n<li>Convert code base to ECMAScript Modules (ESM) and release CommonJS build for node and ESM build for browser bundlers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

EOL 30 Apr 2022.</li>\n<li>Remove the minified UMD build from the package.</li>\n<li>Drop support for browsers that don't correctly implement const/let and default arguments, and no longer transpile the browser build to ES2015.</li>\n<li>Although in practice this is currently a noop since the resulting build does not change, the build will no longer transpiles future changes for Node.js 8.x targets, so semantically this is still a breaking change.</li>\n<li>Deep requiring specific algorithms of this library like require('uuid/v4'), which has been deprecated in uuid@7, is no longer supported.</li>\n<li>The default export, which used to be the v4() method but which was already discouraged in v3.x of this library, has been removed.</li>\n<li>Explicitly note that deep imports of the different uuid version functions are deprecated and no longer encouraged and that ECMAScript module named imports should be used instead. Emit a deprecation warning for people who deep-require the different algorithm variants.</li>\n<li>Remove builtin support for insecure random number generators in the browser. Users who want that will have to supply their own random number generator function.</li>\n<li>Remove support for generating v3 and v5 UUIDs in Node.js&lt;4.x</li>\n<li>Convert code base to ECMAScript Modules (ESM) and release CommonJS build for node and ESM build for browser bundlers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>add parse/stringify/validate/version/NIL APIs (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/479\">#479</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/0e6c10ba1bf9517796ff23c052fc0468eedfd5f4\">0e6c10b</a>)</li>\n<li>add support for MAX uuid (new in RFC9562) (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/714\">#714</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/0385cd3f18ae9920678b2849932fa7a9d9aee7d0\">0385cd3</a>)</li>\n<li>add UMD build to npm package (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/357\">#357</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/4e75adf435196f28e3fbbe0185d654b5ded7ca2c\">4e75adf</a>)</li>\n<li>add various es module and CommonJS examples (<a href=\"https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/b238510bf352463521f74bab175a3af9b7a42555\">b238510</a>)</li>\n<li>enforce Conventional Commit style commit messages (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/282\">#282</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/0705cd5bae3ab07415294e5544901ffcf0ad4e23\">0705cd5</a>)</li>\n<li>ensure that docs are up-to-date in CI (<a href=\"https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/ee5e77db547474f5a8f23d6c857a6d399209986b\">ee5e77d</a>)</li>\n<li>hybrid CommonJS &amp; ECMAScript modules build (<a href=\"https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/a3f078faa0baff69ab41aed08e041f8f9c8993d0\">a3f078f</a>)</li>\n<li>improve performance of v1 string representation (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/453\">#453</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/0ee0b67c37846529c66089880414d29f3ae132d5\">0ee0b67</a>)</li>\n<li>improve v4 performance by reusing random number array (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/435\">#435</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/bf4af0d711b4d2ed03d1f74fd12ad0baa87dc79d\">bf4af0d</a>)</li>\n<li>optimize uuid.v1 by 1.3x uuid.v4 by 4.3x (430%) (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/597\">#597</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/3a033f6bab6bb3780ece6d645b902548043280bc\">3a033f6</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Similarly, `TraversalStrategyVisitorTest.testTraversalStrategy` assumes the deterministic order of keys stored in HashSet. \r\n\r\n### Proposed Fix\r\nThis pr proposes a simple fix by storing the configuration of subgraphStrategy in LinkedHashMap, and storing the reserved keys in LinkedHashSet. After this fix, all the six tests pass consistently. Alternatively, if maintaining Hashmap and Hashset is preferred, I could try to modify the test assertions using regular expression matches or custom comparators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-07T22:21:36Z","updated_at":"2024-11-29T23:08:19Z","closed_at":"2024-11-29T23:08:19Z","merged_at":"2024-11-29T23:08:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"cc74c844d19d2baa9eb13b49b3895d8d02187d1f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/2887/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/2887/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2887/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/aafb3635672e8be31d2be9cddde77e0cbe8469c5","head":{"label":"qz0610:fix-tests","ref":"fix-tests","sha":"aafb3635672e8be31d2be9cddde77e0cbe8469c5","user":{"login":"qz0610","id":101075497,"node_id":"U_kgDOBgZKKQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101075497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610","html_url":"https://github.com/qz0610","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":851925667,"node_id":"R_kgDOMsdaow","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"qz0610/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"qz0610","id":101075497,"node_id":"U_kgDOBgZKKQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101075497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610","html_url":"https://github.com/qz0610","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/qz0610/tinkerpop","description":"Apache

connection pooling to reflect having switched from long lived web socket connections to short lived http connections:\r\n- sped up obtaining a new connection by removing method-level synchronization of getAvailableConnection and introducing a separate set for available connections\r\n- introduced cleanup of idle connections to release resources\r\n- removed minSize since idle connections are now cleaned up and the pool can become empty if there is no traffic\r\n- increased maxSize default to 128\r\n- increased core pool size of ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor that is used for creating new connections to number of available processors\r\n- added logging to help troubleshoot connection related integration tests failures\r\n\r\nProfilingApplication throughput results of master-http prior
