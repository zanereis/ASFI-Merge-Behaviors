all, I open this PR want to confirm that I am doing the right thing.  there is so much work that needs to do, like unit test case, scenario test case，optimize the spring MVC match logic \r\nIn a distributed system, hundreds of services in the skywalking cluster, group endpoint name in the server by regex pattern configuration are very difficult for skywalking cluster maintainer, even impossible. using a group mechanism in the agent may be better. \r\nfor example, the servlet container has no path variable concept, and spring mvc achieves this feature.   if a request with a path variable is rejected by a servlet filter (like authenticate filter)，the endpoint can not reset by spring mvc interceptor. \r\n\r\nit will cause endpoint options in skywalking UI very hard to use (endpoint traffic), more cost for metric aggregation(especial endpoint 2 endpoint relations ), and more alarm window for alarm module (even oom in OAP server). \r\nwe can get the path mapping info when controller creating, and try to rename endpoint(use same logic like spring MVC path match) when sending to skywalking backend service. now I made the feature in an optional plugin.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-04T16:14:05Z","updated_at":"2021-05-26T08:59:17Z","closed_at":"2021-05-26T08:59:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6e10b196ef7e4074c55c8655f1f7c2b2a726ae65","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ascrutae","id":12436447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDM2NDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12436447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascrutae","html_url":"https://github.com/ascrutae","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascrutae/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascrutae/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascrutae/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascrutae/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascrutae/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascrutae/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascrutae/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascrutae/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascrutae/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kezhenxu94","id":15965696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTY1Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15965696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94","html_url":"https://github.com/kezhenxu94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"zifeihan","id":16839929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODM5OTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16839929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zifeihan","html_url":"https://github.com/zifeihan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zifeihan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zifeihan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zifeihan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zifeihan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zifeihan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zifeihan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zifeihan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zifeihan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zifeihan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1484785247,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDg0Nzg1MjQ3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/no%20update","name":"no

Fix MAL function would miss samples name after creating new samples.\r\n- [X] Add a unit test to verify that the fix works.\r\n- [X] Explain briefly why the bug exists and how to fix it.\r\n- [X] If this pull request closes/resolves/fixes an existing issue, replace the issue number. Closes #6857\r\n- [X] Update the [`CHANGES` log](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/CHANGES.md).\r\n\r\nWhen MAL do `aggregate` like `sum/max/min` or do `avg`/`histogram`, there used `InternalOps.newSample`.\r\nBut this function missed the samples name:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16773043/116363577-dd08b300-a835-11eb-9478-87db7d94b07c.png)\r\n\r\nThat is impacted the `rate/irate/increase` functions because when we do increase count we use sample `name` and `labels` \r\nas the `id` to separate the samples.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16773043/116364181-818af500-a836-11eb-9c24-b30070bba4ba.png)\r\n\r\nSo, in some scenario, for example:\r\n```yaml\r\n  - name: cpu_total_percentage\r\n    exp: (node_cpu_seconds_total * 100).tagNotEqual('mode' , 'idle').sum(['node_identifier_host_name']).rate('PT1M')\r\n  - name: disk_written\r\n    exp: node_disk_written_bytes_total.sum(['node_identifier_host_name']).rate('PT1M')\r\n```\r\nThese 2 expressions will make the samples have the same labels if the sample name missed, the `id` above would the same.\r\nThe cache and calculate of the value would incorrect, this caused issue #6857.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-28T07:50:09Z","updated_at":"2021-04-29T00:51:26Z","closed_at":"2021-04-28T15:09:58Z","merged_at":"2021-04-28T15:09:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"db1d655b47ff976586eb1ac5e63f5feb3275b6a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"hanahmily","id":1960537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjA1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1960537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily","html_url":"https://github.com/hanahmily","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":283421094,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODM0MjEwOTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":"Something
