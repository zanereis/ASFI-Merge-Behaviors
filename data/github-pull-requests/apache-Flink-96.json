in FineGrainedSlotManagerTestBase\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-28T09:23:24Z","updated_at":"2021-08-28T13:05:48Z","closed_at":"2021-07-29T06:07:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"138045e819c0c5e1eeb3e342ce6620d096464447","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16623/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16623/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/16623/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/02a3eddc2faee7667ec8b27f370db1b6f8aeaff0","head":{"label":"KarmaGYZ:FLINK-22891","ref":"FLINK-22891","sha":"02a3eddc2faee7667ec8b27f370db1b6f8aeaff0","user":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159165742,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTkxNjU3NDI=","name":"flink","full_name":"KarmaGYZ/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe pr aims to refactor the time indicator materialization, including:\r\n1. Move `time_indicator` materialize after `logical_rewrite` phase, which is closely before the physical optimization\r\n2. Refactor `RelTimeIndicatorConverter` to match `FlinkLogicalRel`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - Refactor `RelTimeIndicatorConverter` to match `FlinkLogicalRel`\r\n  - Refactor `RelTimeIndicatorConverter#visitWindowAggregate` because LogicalWindow and namedProperties should be updated after convert match_rowtime from timestamp (rowtime) to timestamp_ltz(rowtime)\r\n  - Update `LogicalWindowAggregateRuleBase#getOutAggregateGroupExpression` because after moving `time_indicator` materialize after `logical_rewrite` phase, `LogicalWindowAggregateRuleBase` should handle time indicator case\r\n  - Update updated xml for plan test which are expected because moving `time_indicator` materialize after `logical_rewrite` phase, which is closely before the physical optimization\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nExisted UT/IT\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

PR is cherry-picked from #16462.)\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently when comparing temporal type with invalid string literal, NullPointerException will be thrown as we'll first cast the string literal to the desired temporal type, resulting in a null value.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, when the string literal is not in a valid date/time/timestamp format, an exception with message \"String xxx is not a valid date/time/timestamp\" will be thrown, otherwise the comparison code will be generated as normal.\r\n\r\nThe comparison result will be null if either operand is null, and will be true/false if both operands are not null.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Fix NullPointerException when comparing temporal type with invalid string literal\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified by running the added tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, JDBC XA sink creates/uses a connection per transaction.\r\nThis is to support databases with a single transaction-per-connection drivers.\r\nHowever, it has an overhead and can lead to exceeding connection limits.\r\n\r\nThis change disables this feature by default and adds an option to enable it.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis is a trivial change without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? no\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-28T05:59:54Z","updated_at":"2021-08-28T13:09:46Z","closed_at":"2021-08-05T08:50:56Z","merged_at":"2021-08-05T08:50:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"0b4d17e7894fa0f3624f182e2222edff447cf5a8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278775149,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4Nzc1MTQ5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/JDBC","name":"component=Connectors/JDBC","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16615/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16615/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/16615/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e68ad4e39722b4ac9ac4eda6f61c5e2b3d180873","head":{"label":"rkhachatryan:f23437","ref":"f23437","sha":"e68ad4e39722b4ac9ac4eda6f61c5e2b3d180873","user":{"login":"rkhachatryan","id":3939322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzkzMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3939322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan","html_url":"https://github.com/rkhachatryan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222429887,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjI0Mjk4ODc=","name":"flink","full_name":"rkhachatryan/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rkhachatryan","id":3939322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzkzMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3939322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan","html_url":"https://github.com/rkhachatryan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rkhachatryan/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nFix source table with 'csv.disable-quote-character' = 'true' can not take effect in flink 1.12.\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.flink.shaded.jackson2.com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParseException: Unexpected character ('n' (code 110)): Expected separator ('\"' (code 34)) or end-of-line\r\n at [Source: (org.apache.flink.shaded.jackson2.com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.csv.impl.UTF8Reader); line: 1, column: 6]\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.jackson2.com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParser._constructError(JsonParser.java:1840)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.jackson2.com.fasterxml.jackson.core.base.ParserMinimalBase._reportError(ParserMinimalBase.java:712)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.jackson2.com.fasterxml.jackson.core.base.ParserMinimalBase._reportUnexpectedChar(ParserMinimalBase.java:637)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.jackson2.com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.csv.CsvParser._reportUnexpectedCsvChar(CsvParser.java:1254)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.jackson2.com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.csv.impl.CsvDecoder._nextQuotedString(CsvDecoder.java:867)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.jackson2.com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.csv.impl.CsvDecoder.nextString(CsvDecoder.java:630)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.jackson2.com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.csv.CsvParser._handleNextEntry(CsvParser.java:846)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.jackson2.com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.csv.CsvParser.nextFieldName(CsvParser.java:665)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.jackson2.com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.std.BaseNodeDeserializer.deserializeObject(JsonNodeDeserializer.java:249)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.jackson2.com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.std.JsonNodeDeserializer.deserialize(JsonNodeDeserializer.java:68)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.jackson2.com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.std.JsonNodeDeserializer.deserialize(JsonNodeDeserializer.java:15)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.jackson2.com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectReader._bindAndClose(ObjectReader.java:1719)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.shaded.jackson2.com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectReader.readValue(ObjectReader.java:1282)\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.formats.csv.CsvRowDataDeserializationSchema.deserialize(CsvRowDataDeserializationSchema.java:145)\r\n\t... 9 more\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nInvoke disableQuoteChar of CsvSchema when 'disable-quote-character' is enabled.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nIt can be verified in CsvFormatFactoryTest#testDeserializeWithDisableQuoteCharacter.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nEnsures that the `flink-table-planner` module is compilable when using Scala 1.12.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that we can remove it again before releasing 1.14 by dropping the affected legacy `ExpressionParser`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* In order to support compilation with ARM (e.g. Apple M1 chip), we need to bump our Protobuf dependency to version 3.17.3.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Updated com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java from 3.11.1 to 3.17.3\r\n- Hardcoded version for plugin protoc-jar-maven-plugin:protoc-jar-maven-plugin since that's not in sync with com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java to the latest available version\r\n- Updated NOTICE files to deal with new version number\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: yes\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): don't know\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFrom the fabric8 Kubernetes client [compatibility matrix](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client#compatibility-matrix), v4.9.2 is no longer supporting K8s 1.18.0 and above versions. So we need to bump the K8s client to the latest stable version v5.5.0.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we also find some known bugs in v4.9.2 and have to do some temporary fixes in Flink. They will be removed after this bumping the fabric8 K8s version.\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-kubernetes/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/kubernetes/kubeclient/FlinkKubeClientFactory.java#L97\r\n* https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-kubernetes/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/kubernetes/kubeclient/resources/KubernetesSharedInformer.java#L81\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Bump fabric8 Kubernetes client version to 5.5.0\r\n* Remove the unnecessary temporary fix for fabric8 Kubernetes client max concurrent requests\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis PR does not take any concrete behavior changes. So the existing tests are enough.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the materialization part for generalized incremental checkpoints [FLIP 158]. \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n1. materialization is triggered periodically, set up by\r\nPERIODIC_MATERIALIZATION_INTERVAL\r\nThe initial materialization delay equals PERIODIC_MATERIALIZATION_INTERVAL\r\n\r\n2. we allow a certain number of async uploading file failures, determined by \r\nMATERIALIZATION_MAX_ALLOWED_FAILURES\r\n- Within the # of max allowed failure, uploading will be cleaned up with the best effort and reuploading in the next materialization round\r\n- If materialization continuous failure # >= MATERIALIZATION_MAX_ALLOWED_FAILURES, materialization failure will cause task failure.\r\n\r\n3. There is one materialization ongoing at a time\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n1. Unit tests for all existing backends + checkpoint storage\r\n2. Will enable materialization tests in FLINK-23559\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nStep-by-step modernize **flink-runtime-web**, i.e. Flink UI.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nBump to the latest version of Angular and NG-Zorro.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-27T08:20:24Z","updated_at":"2021-11-01T09:43:40Z","closed_at":"2021-08-16T15:08:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8d837c0168c5d617caa7903e77f80e142e3ebf24","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273025479,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDI1NDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/WebFrontend","name":"component=Runtime/WebFrontend","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16603/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16603/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/16603/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/63a1ff7d978ee4a555997d7f7d071dafa6bd5e3e","head":{"label":"yangjunhan:build/runtime-web-bump-8","ref":"build/runtime-web-bump-8","sha":"63a1ff7d978ee4a555997d7f7d071dafa6bd5e3e","user":{"login":"yangjunhan","id":50307523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzA3NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50307523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan","html_url":"https://github.com/yangjunhan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":304250838,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDQyNTA4Mzg=","name":"flink","full_name":"yangjunhan/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yangjunhan","id":50307523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzA3NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50307523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan","html_url":"https://github.com/yangjunhan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yangjunhan/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe test `test_kubernetes_application_ha.sh` could fail because of timeout(30s) waiting for log `Restoring job 00000000000000000000000000000000 from Checkpoint`. I did not find any exceptions, potential bugs for Kubernetes HA and recovery process. It just seems that the JobManager started and recovered slowly. This PR will increase the timeout to 120s to make the test more stable.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Increase the timeout to make kubernetes application ha test more stable\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* Already covered by `test_kubernetes_application_ha.sh`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-27T06:04:24Z","updated_at":"2021-08-28T12:23:46Z","closed_at":"2021-07-28T08:49:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9abf723c3ac413c60dcc166f0d5590006ad5efa8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278776326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4Nzc2MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/Kubernetes","name":"component=Deployment/Kubernetes","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16602/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16602/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/16602/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/827ad0e60c7e9f6cdd80057ab1070577a6376887","head":{"label":"wangyang0918:FLINK-23418-k8s-e2e-timeout","ref":"FLINK-23418-k8s-e2e-timeout","sha":"827ad0e60c7e9f6cdd80057ab1070577a6376887","user":{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205999027,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU5OTkwMjc=","name":"flink","full_name":"wangyang0918/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR add a new option for PubSub source called :`withoutCheckpoint`, to disable checkpoint verification.\r\nThis is useful for  testing, and especially when using [Ververica platform](https://www.ververica.com/platform)-> Sql editor (they disable checkpointing for preview cluster)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - new option is added to `PubSubSource` called :`checkpointDisabled`, to disable checkpoint verification.\r\n  - default value is false, meaning current behaviour will remain until explicit change to `true`.\r\n  - If value set to `true`, the method `hasNoCheckpointingEnabled` will not raise error anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know) don't know\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): don't know\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: yes (checkpointing)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes, kind of, \r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not documented (can you help me where should I document it)\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-26T11:14:40Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T03:41:19Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"NicoK","id":213026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzAyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK","html_url":"https://github.com/NicoK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicoK/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1364415762,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzY0NDE1NzYy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/GoogleCloudPubSub","name":"component=Connectors/GoogleCloudPubSub","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16596/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16596/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/16596/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d9ccfb6ac3ed69fe564457b30cf33a51146275ab","head":{"label":"brachi-wernick:FLINK-23495-support-no-checkpoints","ref":"FLINK-23495-support-no-checkpoints","sha":"d9ccfb6ac3ed69fe564457b30cf33a51146275ab","user":{"login":"brachi-wernick","id":3658085,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTgwODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3658085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick","html_url":"https://github.com/brachi-wernick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":389582410,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODk1ODI0MTA=","name":"flink","full_name":"brachi-wernick/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brachi-wernick","id":3658085,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTgwODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3658085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick","html_url":"https://github.com/brachi-wernick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brachi-wernick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brachi-wernick/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis removes the deprecated `#connect` API and updates the documentation. The removal of the old descriptors has been split into a new sub-task.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Remove `#connect` from the entire stack.\r\n* Update all documentation using `#connect` to use either the new `TableDescriptor`, or SQL DDL directly.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature

For s3-hadoop some Hadoop-specific configuration is needed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider: com.amazonaws.auth.WebIdentityTokenCredentialsProvider\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Update presto-hive from 0.187 to 0.257\r\n* Update s3 aws from 1.11.788 to 1.11.951\r\n* Document a bit better how to determine exclusions for presto-hive.\r\n* Reorganize exclusions.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: yes\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-26T07:19:07Z","updated_at":"2021-08-28T13:08:43Z","closed_at":"2021-08-04T12:41:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b51f7296a993d46fdf3117b78df321fdc7e29bbb","assignee":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278672464,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4NjcyNDY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=FileSystems","name":"component=FileSystems","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16592/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16592/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/16592/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/b43f20faecbe64fe76491fabd38cf82072855f8a","head":{"label":"Airblader:FLINK-23487","ref":"FLINK-23487","sha":"b43f20faecbe64fe76491fabd38cf82072855f8a","user":{"login":"Airblader","id":2392216,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTIyMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2392216?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airblader","html_url":"https://github.com/Airblader","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airblader/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airblader/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airblader/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airblader/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airblader/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airblader/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airblader/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airblader/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airblader/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":330998864,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzA5OTg4NjQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"Airblader/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Airblader","id":2392216,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTIyMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2392216?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airblader","html_url":"https://github.com/Airblader","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airblader/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airblader/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airblader/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airblader/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airblader/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airblader/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airblader/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airblader/events{/pri

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWe want to be able to bring the entire topology with a single checkpoint/savepoint. In order to do that we must be able to call finish on all operators before such a checkpoint is triggered. The idea is to emit EndOfData, which once received, triggers finish()/endInput(). After such a sequence we can trigger a checkpoint/savepoint which meets the aforementioned criteria.\r\n\r\nThis PR reworks the `stop-with-savepoint --drain` a bit so that it works correctly with the EndOfData already. Moreover it stops the legacy sources before triggering the final savepoint, so that it includes all records.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nSee commit messages\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAll tests pass, especially around savepoints, such as e.g. SavepointITCase. Added a couple of additional tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Support column comment in Schema and ResolvedSchema*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Support column comment in Schema and ResolvedSchema\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests\r\n such as\r\n -  testSchemaResolution  in SchemaResolutionTest .\r\n -  testUnresolvedSchemaString  in SchemaResolutionTest .\r\n -  testResolvedSchemaString  in SchemaResolutionTest .\r\n \r\nI only made small change in SchemaResolutionTest. \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-25T10:38:02Z","updated_at":"2021-08-28T12:23:42Z","closed_at":"2021-07-28T08:19:59Z","merged_at":"2021-07-28T08:19:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"4f96ac4c7510f31b95c9a183eb556717c9140d87","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16588/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16588/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/16588/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/28774cb45a375dde25c18e73bbfd7afa684ee151","head":{"label":"hackergin:FLINK-22936","ref":"FLINK-22936","sha":"28774cb45a375dde25c18e73bbfd7afa684ee151","user":{"login":"hackergin","id":24229889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjI5ODg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24229889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin","html_url":"https://github.com/hackergin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":258399408,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTgzOTk0MDg=","name":"flink","full_name":"hackergin/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hackergin","id":24229889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjI5ODg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24229889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin","html_url":"https://github.com/hackergin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hackergin/flink","description":"Apache

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nwhen implements the LookupFunction In SQL that indirect extends (Async)TableFunction, we extract the output type class use ExtractionUtils#extractSimpleGeneric, this method will return empty when dealing with indirect extended subclasses. We need to fix this bug.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - change method ExtractionUtils#extractSimpleGeneric, traverse all the super classes to the base class until find the generic parameter in pos has real class type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added a unit Test which verified the static method result. （org.apache.flink.table.utils.ExtractionUtilsTest）\r\n  \r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? no\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-23T14:37:48Z","updated_at":"2022-02-11T03:44:58Z","closed_at":"2022-02-11T03:44:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"09f2145717dcf6c8f5e518d743e86fae6676a984","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16584/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16584/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/16584/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/597398ed8010c365dda03ccd590dce85e36eb7a8","head":{"label":"adiaixin:FLINK-23436-REBASE2","ref":"FLINK-23436-REBASE2","sha":"597398ed8010c365dda03ccd590dce85e36eb7a8","user":{"login":"adiaixin","id":12028321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI4MzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12028321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiaixin","html_url":"https://github.com/adiaixin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiaixin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiaixin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiaixin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiaixin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiaixin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiaixin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiaixin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiaixin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiaixin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":284585687,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODQ1ODU2ODc=","name":"flink","full_name":"adiaixin/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"adiaixin","id":12028321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI4MzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12028321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiaixin","html_url":"https://github.com/adiaixin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiaixin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiaixin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiaixin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiaixin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiaixin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiaixin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiaixin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiaixin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiaixin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/adiaixin/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nGuarantee the watching event handling order manually in KubernetesSharedInformer instead of depending on a lock.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as `KubernetesSharedInformerITCase`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-23T13:11:13Z","updated_at":"2021-08-28T12:21:46Z","closed_at":"2021-07-26T05:59:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a361981d967fdd9190b15c134f0334e6745f0c54","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278776326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4Nzc2MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/Kubernetes","name":"component=Deployment/Kubernetes","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16583/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16583/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/16583/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/93fbe85c4b7ff0faa3c3bcdd5a51a116349ec550","head":{"label":"yittg:fix-order","ref":"fix-order","sha":"93fbe85c4b7ff0faa3c3bcdd5a51a116349ec550","user":{"login":"yittg","id":4429171,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjkxNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4429171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg","html_url":"https://github.com/yittg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":192646939,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTI2NDY5Mzk=","name":"flink","full_name":"yittg/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yittg","id":4429171,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjkxNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4429171?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg","html_url":"https://github.com/yittg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yittg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yittg/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Fix a small typo issue in time.md, doc link: [https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.13/docs/concepts/time/](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.13/docs/concepts/time/)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n  - *Change `take a look a` to `take a look at` in time.md*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis introduces the config option `execution.shuffle-mode` which is an enum of values `ALL_EXCHANGES_BLOCKING`, `ALL_EXCHANGES_PIPELINED`, and `AUTOMATIC`.\r\n\r\nIt replaces `table.exec.shuffle-mode` and allows to influence the `GlobalStreamExchangeMode` for both DataStream API and Table API consistently.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Use `GlobalStreamExchangeMode.ALL_EDGES_BLOCKING` as new default for batch mode\r\n- Add `ShuffleMode` option\r\n- Refactor `StreamGraphGenerator` to pick up this option\r\n- Adjust table planner to pick up this option and deprecate `table.exec.shuffle-mode`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows: various tests added\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with

PR is cherry-picked from #16511)\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently `TIMESTAMPADD(MINUTE, 10, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)` will be deduced as `timestamp` type. However this should be `timestamp with local time zone` type. With this incorrect type, code generation will refuse to work.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue by copying and modifying the corresponding classes from Calcite.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Fix return value deduction of TIMESTAMPADD function\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified by running the added tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not

subsumption (requires FLINK-21504)\r\n - ~call `stateUsed` on materialization (requires FLINK-21357)~ - FLINK-23344\r\n - call `stateUsed` on upload from DFS Changelog Writer (requires rebase as FLINK-21353 is now merged)\r\n - implement `getStateChangeUsageTracker` by DFS `StateChangelogStorage` (requires rebase as FLINK-21353 is now merged)\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Added `TaskStateRegistryImplTest` unit tests\r\n- TBD: integration tests (after subsumption notification)\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  -

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nwhen implements the LookupFunction In SQL that indirect extends (Async)TableFunction, we extract the output type class use ExtractionUtils#extractSimpleGeneric, this method will return empty when dealing with indirect extended subclasses.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Remove the usage of the Yaml file in SQL Client. We have already removed the usage of the YAML in e2e before and replace with the sql file.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Delete all codes related to `Environment`*\r\n  - *Clean up the tests about loading and init with Yaml file*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / **not documented**)\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-22T06:25:42Z","updated_at":"2022-09-26T02:06:08Z","closed_at":"2021-07-26T12:04:34Z","merged_at":"2021-07-26T12:04:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"19a1a1ab927345b36f50ccb91bddfb21193acd4e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1333559280,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMzNTU5Mjgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Client","name":"component=TableSQL/Client","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16563/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16563/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/16563/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/46f301080a8f5c934539241c7390b81524bd13ea","head":{"label":"fsk119:rm-yaml-file","ref":"rm-yaml-file","sha":"46f301080a8f5c934539241c7390b81524bd13ea","user":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":270591305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzA1OTEzMDU=","name":"flink","full_name":"fsk119/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds support for [abfs](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-azure/abfs.html) to talk to ADLS Gen2 (Azure DataLake Gen2) storage accounts. These are newer storage account types that hierarchical namespaces, abfs takes advantage of this newer capability. Azure recommends using abfs for reading/writing to these newer storage accounts. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Upgrade the hadoop version to latest. Existing version that flink depends on doesn't have hadoop abfs implementation. \r\n- Added support for two new schemes (abfs:// and abfss://)\r\n- Added english documentation. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Ran existing tests to make sure there are no regressions\r\n- Added few trivial unit tests. File system implementations are really hard to test using unit tests. Existing filesystems unit tests seems to be super thin. \r\n- Tested abfs, abfss manually using a flink clusters on AKS using the instructions [here](https://github.com/srinipunuru/flink-playground/blob/master/abfs-support/README.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (**yes** / no / don't know) - Because of the upgrade of the hadoop version\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

usages of the `NodeCache` with a `TreeCache`.\r\n\r\nThe core issue is that the `NodeCache` tries to ensure that the parents to the observed node exist. This can result in curator exceptions that crash the TM if concurrently the path is being deleted. Originally I tried to create a modified `NodeCache` implementation, but got a bad feeling when it came to maintaining said class.\r\n\r\nI then looked at other curator caching recipes; the `PathChildrenCache` initially looked neat because it's very purpose is handling entire paths and not single nodes, but it has the same behavior as the `NodeCache` w.r.t. creating parents. \r\n\r\nThen I stumbled on the `TreeCache`, which after some experimenting turned out to be an incredibly flexible class. It _can_ create parent nodes, but its opt-in. It _can_ observe a node tree, but can also be configured to only consider a single node.\r\nEven the listener interface is superior, providing more information as to the node change (added/modified/removed) _and_ connection issues (which this PR makes no use of, but still, _pretty

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This PR implements the calculation of the subtask level throughput which doesn't take into account idle time during the calculation*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Implementaion of the EMA algorithm for calculation of throughput*\r\n  - *The periodic calculation of  throughput via mailbox*\r\n  - *Wrapper for the idle time measurement*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Unit tests for checking correctness of the throughput calculation*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nFixed small typ: scane to scan\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency):  no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no \r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no \r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper:  no \r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no \r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSet up MAPREDUCE_APPLICATION_CLASSPATH to YarnTaskExecutorRunner, to avoid \"ClassNotFoundException\" when accessing MapReduce classes\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nadd DEFAULT_MAPREDUCE_APPLICATION_CLASSPATH to  yarn container environment\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? ( no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-21T10:45:34Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T03:40:50Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272992926,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkyOTI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/YARN","name":"component=Deployment/YARN","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16552/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16552/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/16552/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/f37155567bd0accbd44972db3650eae9c5d893cf","head":{"label":"yuchuanchen:FLINK-23449","ref":"FLINK-23449","sha":"f37155567bd0accbd44972db3650eae9c5d893cf","user":{"login":"yuchuanchen","id":9213476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMTM0NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9213476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchuanchen","html_url":"https://github.com/yuchuanchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchuanchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchuanchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchuanchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchuanchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchuanchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchuanchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchuanchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchuanchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchuanchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":171795414,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE3OTU0MTQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"yuchuanchen/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yuchuanchen","id":9213476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMTM0NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9213476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchuanchen","html_url":"https://github.com/yuchuanchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchuanchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchuanchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchuanchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchuanchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchuanchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchuanchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchuanchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchuanchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchuanchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yuchuanchen/flink","description":"Apache

to preserve FileSystem info (backport PR#16542 to release-1.13)\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix an FileNotFoundException in State Processor API when working with savepoints on cloud storage\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nUse Path instead of a String Path.getPath() in StatePathExtractor to preserve FileSystem info such that FileCopyFunction can copy files even if they are on cloud storage.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nI've tested this fix with Azure blob storage and AWS S3.\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Manually create an S3 bucket or an Azure blob container\r\n- Configure a Flink cluster with s3-fs-presto or azure-fs-haoop plugin enabled\r\n- Start a Flink a job and create a savepoint on S3/azure\r\n- Use state processor API to transform the savepoint to a new one and store it in a new location on S3/azure\r\n- There should not FileNotFoundException\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n- Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n- The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with @Public(Evolving): no\r\n- The serializers:no\r\n- The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n- Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn,

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Remove the usage of the YAML file in SQL Client end to end tests.*\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-21T04:03:05Z","updated_at":"2022-09-26T02:06:03Z","closed_at":"2021-07-22T03:05:48Z","merged_at":"2021-07-22T03:05:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"367131670b6566d130be57d587d9437c106f636f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273164140,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY0MTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Tests","name":"component=Tests","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1333559280,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMzNTU5Mjgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Client","name":"component=TableSQL/Client","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16549/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16549/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/16549/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/46e3b1f7a9a2dd2f1be6997811bbcbbd07cf20be","head":{"label":"fsk119:sqlclient-e2e","ref":"sqlclient-e2e","sha":"46e3b1f7a9a2dd2f1be6997811bbcbbd07cf20be","user":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":270591305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzA1OTEzMDU=","name":"flink","full_name":"fsk119/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nTranslate the page of \"Elasticsearch Connector\" into Chinese\r\n\r\nThe page url is \"https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/zh/docs/connectors/datastream/elasticsearch/\".\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nTranslate \"flink/docs/content.zh/docs/connectors/datastream/elasticsearch.md\"\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* Flink is still using org.apache.httpcomponents.httpclient:4.5.3 and org.apache.httpcomponents.httpclient:4.5.9. Those versions are impacted by CVE-2020-13956 (though Flink is not impacted by it). The latest available version is 4.5.13\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Updated httpclient dependencies from 4.5.3 and 4.5.9 to 4.5.13\r\n  - Updated NOTICE files to deal with new version number\r\n  \r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): don't know\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Added the throughput meter for measurement the subtask level throughput for incoming data*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Added classes for calculating of the throughput*\r\n  - *Added scheduler for start the throughput calculation every period of time*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Tests for StreamTask*\r\n  - *Tests for throughput algorithms*\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

to preserve FileSystem info\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix an FileNotFoundException in State Processor API when working with savepoints on cloud storage\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Use Path instead of a String Path.getPath() in StatePathExtractor to preserve FileSystem info such that FileCopyFunction can copy files even if they are on cloud storage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nI've tested this fix with Azure blob storage and AWS S3. \r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Manually create an S3 bucket or an Azure blob container\r\n- Configure a Flink cluster with s3-fs-presto or azure-fs-haoop plugin enabled\r\n- Start a Flink a job and create a savepoint on S3/azure\r\n- Use state processor API to transform the savepoint to a new one and store it in a new location on S3/azure\r\n- There should not FileNotFoundException\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCollect sink has a batch size which is currently not configurable. By the user request in FLINK-23352 we're making it configurable in this PR to support user with super large row size.\r\n\r\nNote that these configuration are only available for table APIs. As we cannot read user config in data stream API, data stream users will have to write their own Java code to create collect sink explicitly if they want to configure these.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Add configuration for batch size and socket timeout of collect sink\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified by running the added tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This pull request is the second part of optimizing the deployment of tasks. In this pull request, we propose to distribute the cached ShuffleDescriptors via the blob server if their overall size has exceeded the threshold. For more details please check FLINK-23218. The first part of the optimization is located at #16314.*\r\n\r\n*In this pull request we remove the cache from blob server on JobManager once it's no longer required. To remove the cache from the blob cache located on TaskManager, please check #16498.*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *The cached ShuffleDescriptors are stored in the blob server if its size exceeded the threshold.*\r\n  - *The cached ShuffleDescriptors will be removed from the blob server once it's no longer used on JobManager.*\r\n  - *TaskManagers can retrieve the ShuffleDescriptors from the blob cache.*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - *Added unit tests to test the ShuffleDescriptors are cached and removed correctly.*\r\n  - *Added unit tests to verify that deleting files on blob server works as expected.*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running an end-to-end test. The job has two JobVertices. One is source, while the other is sink. The parallelism is 8k and 16k. They are connected with an all-to-all edge. Both streaming mode and batch mode are tested.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis refactors some enum classes that are used for more or less the same purpose but in different parts of the stack with different values. It should reduce confusion and collisions with API classes.\r\n\r\nThe new naming is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDataExchangeMode (for network stack, remains as it is)\r\n\r\nShuffleMode -> StreamExchangeMode (belongs to *stream* graph and influences the data *exchange*)\r\n\r\nGlobalDataExchangeMode -> GlobalStreamExchangeMode (belongs to *stream* graph and influences the data *exchange* but globally)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn docs and API we will expose the word \"shuffle\" also for shuffle service etc. Thus, we will add a new `ShuffleMode` enum according to FLIP-134 for the API. The API enum class will follow in the next PR.\r\n\r\nThe word \"exchange\" is used internally for declaring shuffles in graphs.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nUse the term \"exchange mode\" consistently.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-19T16:02:23Z","updated_at":"2021-09-23T18:08:12Z","closed_at":"2021-07-21T13:41:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e6029d4a1fb12da8bbb5730cdf33b684ffb9e3c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273055469,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDU1NDY5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/DataStream","name":"component=API/DataStream","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16536/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/16536/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/16536/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/c8ecae2fd07bc9e2d36db1a2c2a49a8d0c59a924","head":{"label":"twalthr:FLINK-23402","ref":"FLINK-23402","sha":"c8ecae2fd07bc9e2d36db1a2c2a49a8d0c59a924","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20658760,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY1ODc2MA==","name":"flink","full_name":"twalthr/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?
