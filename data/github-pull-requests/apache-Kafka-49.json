`NoSuchMethodError` is thrown if an application tries to call a specified method of a class (either static or instance), and that class no longer has a definition of that method. Normally, this error is caught by the compiler; this error can only occur at run time if the definition of a class has incompatibly changed.\r\n- `NoSuchMethodException` is thrown when trying to reflectively access a method that does not exist.\r\n- Both the `SourceTaskContext::transactionContext` and `SinkTaskContext::errantRecordReporter` methods use `NoSuchMethodError` in the example code

String format specifier from %s to %d for multiple int/long type variables. The ticket mentioned that using %s to format int/long data type might potentially lead to locale-sensitive handling issue. However, as far as I can see, all these variables have whole integer values, where as locale-sensitive issues may happen at values with separators.

Summary\r\n\r\nThe Reflections library has a race condition that causes it to sometimes throw an NPE. This NPE crashes the connect worker on startup, both in live environments and in tests, and causes those tests to be flaky. This PR uses reflection to patch the library and eliminate the race condition. This is done instead of upstreaming the patch or forking the library because the library itself is unmaintained and should be phased out.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can consider upgrading the library to a version which has patched this bug: #14029 \r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nThe Reflections library makes use of a data structure `Store` to store the results of scanning for later querying. The scanner writes to the store during `Reflections#scan()` via the `SubTypesScanner`. The store is later queried by `Reflections#getSubTypesOf`.\r\n\r\nDue to the slow speed of reflectively discovering all classes on the classpath and plugin.path, the Reflections library is used with a parallel executor, increasing the scanning speed. Unfortunately the parallel mode of the library has some bugs, one of which have already been patched via the InternalReflections subclass.\r\n\r\nThe parallel mode causes the Store to receive concurrent writes. The javadoc for the class does not specify that it is or isn't thread-safe, but due to the use of ConcurrentHashMap and the support for parallel scanning in Reflections, the class seems intended to be thread-safe.\r\n\r\n## Symptoms\r\n\r\nThe failure appears as the following stack trace.\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n    at java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap.get(ConcurrentHashMap.java:936)\r\n    at org.reflections.Store.getAllIncluding(Store.java:82)\r\n    at org.reflections.Store.getAll(Store.java:93)\r\n    at org.reflections.Reflections.getSubTypesOf(Reflections.java:404)\r\n    at org.apache.kafka.connect.runtime.isolation.DelegatingClassLoader.getPluginDesc(DelegatingClassLoader.java:355)\r\n    at org.apache.kafka.connect.runtime.isolation.DelegatingClassLoader.scanPluginPath(DelegatingClassLoader.java:340)\r\n    at org.apache.kafka.connect.runtime.isolation.DelegatingClassLoader.scanUrlsAndAddPlugins(DelegatingClassLoader.java:268)\r\n    at org.apache.kafka.connect.runtime.isolation.DelegatingClassLoader.initPluginLoader(DelegatingClassLoader.java:216)\r\n    at org.apache.kafka.connect.runtime.isolation.DelegatingClassLoader.initLoaders(DelegatingClassLoader.java:209)\r\n    at org.apache.kafka.connect.runtime.isolation.Plugins.<init>(Plugins.java:61)\r\n    at org.apache.kafka.connect.cli.ConnectDistributed.startConnect(ConnectDistributed.java:91)\r\n```\r\nThe stack trace refers to the old location of this code, but the failure persists in it's new location. The line numbers inside of the Reflections library are still accurate, since we haven't upgraded the version of this library in several years.\r\n\r\n## Diagnosis\r\n\r\nFrom the stacktrace, the NPE is caused by the argument of `ConcurrentHashMap#get(String)` being null. Tracing backwards, this value is ultimately read from `Store#storeMap`, meaning it contains a null in the innermost Collection. Also, it contains this null after all of the concurrent scanning has finished (see `Reflections#scan` where it waits for all of the submitted futures) so there are no writes racing with the reads. **The `Store#storeMap` contains a null at the end of scanning**.\r\n\r\nAnalyzing the data flow into the `Store#storeMap`, we can see that there is only one method which writes to it: `Store#put(String, String, String)`, where the last argument is added into the innermost collection. This method is called in various places: \r\n* `Reflections#expandSuperTypes` always non-null, and access is single-threaded\r\n* `Store#merge` (not used) null iff already null in the other Store, and access is single-threaded\r\n* `XmlSerializer#read` (not used) null iff null in the XML file, and access is single-threaded\r\n* `AbstractScanner#put` always non-null, **but the method is called concurrently**\r\n\r\nBecause the argument appears to be non-null on all active code-paths, it doesn't appear that the null could be coming from a caller. Because there are no null values upon entering the method, and there are when exiting, I believe the method itself must be introducing a null. The only interesting property of this method is that it is called concurrently, so there could be a concurrency bug.\r\n\r\nFollowing the hypothesis that this is due to concurrency, I looked for potentially non-thread-safe stuff in this method implementation:\r\n```\r\n    public boolean put(String index, String key, String value) {\r\n        return storeMap.computeIfAbsent(index, s -> new ConcurrentHashMap<>())\r\n                .computeIfAbsent(key, s -> new ArrayList<>())\r\n                .add(value);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe innermost Collection turns out to be a non-thread-safe ArrayList instance. From the ArrayList javadoc:\r\n\r\n```\r\n* <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>\r\n * If multiple threads access an {@code ArrayList} instance concurrently,\r\n * and at least one of the threads modifies the list structurally, it\r\n * <i>must</i> be synchronized externally.  (A structural modification is\r\n * any operation that adds or deletes one or more elements, or explicitly\r\n * resizes the backing array; merely setting the value of an element is not\r\n * a structural modification.)  This is typically accomplished by\r\n * synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the list.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this specific usage pattern, the `ArrayList#add()` is not synchronized, and structurally modifies the list. Once the `ConcurrentHashMap#computeIfAbsent` calls complete, there is no synchronization between the different threads operating on the returned Collection instance, and the racing writes can cause unexpected behavior. I found references online which indicate that **one symptom of concurrent use of an ArrayList is the appearance of nulls when none were explicitly inserted**, the effect we were seeing in the `Store#storeMap` contents.\r\n\r\n## Reflective fix\r\n\r\nThe Store class is not final, so we can subclass it to override behaviors, and then inject the custom store into the existing InternalReflections class used for the existing fix. Unfortunately the `Store#storeMap` instance variable is private, meaning that we can't simply override the `put` method. I elected to use reflection to make the field visible and override the single `put` method, because patching the behavior without reflection required overriding every read method, essentially copying the whole class. If the reflective accesses fail, the InternalStore falls back to the Store behavior, re-introducing the race condition.\r\n\r\nRather than replacing the ArrayList, I chose to use Collections.synchronizedList to make it synchronized. I plan on running some manual performance tests to see how this impacts the scanning time, and we can evaluate changing the collection to something more performant.\r\n\r\n## Backport\r\n\r\nThis change is targeted at the ReflectionScanner on trunk, but I can easily re-write it to target the DelegatingLoader on <= 3.5. The bug has been present ever since the scanning was made parallel in #4561 so there are a lot of affected branches that could benefit from this patch, but the severity may not warrant any backporting.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

[KIP-875](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-875%3A+First-class+offsets+support+in+Kafka+Connect)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nImplements the new `alterOffsets` method in all three MM2 connectors. The only connector that makes use of the Connect framework-managed offsets at runtime is the `MirrorSourceConnector`, but since the other two connectors also emit offsets with their records, we also allow users to add/remove offsets for them as well, as long as the offsets match the format of the ones that are emitted by the connectors.\r\n\r\n### Integration testing\r\nAn integration test case is added (or really, augmented) that focuses primarily on the `MirrorSourceConnector`. This case piggybacks off of the existing `MirrorConnectorsExactlyOnceIntegrationTest::testReplication` test case, which is done for a few reasons:\r\n- Every new case added to the `MirrorConnectorsIntegrationBaseTest` is run by that class and all of its subclasses (of which there are currently five), which can lead to bloat in testing runtime\r\n- Graceful shutdown of MM2 tasks may not always occur in a timely fashion, which can cause them to emit stale offsets after they are supposed to have been stopped; running with exactly-once support eliminates this risk\r\n- Some subclasses of the `MirrorConnectorsIntegrationBaseTest` (specifically, the `MirrorConnectorsIntegrationTransactionsTest` suite) cause unpredictable behavior with offsets that can make it harder to verify an exact number of records in a replicated topic due to, e.g., control records\r\n\r\nStill, this is a little hacky. Happy to change things up if we think it's worth the work to find something cleaner.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

externally modify source connector offsets via the `PATCH /offsets` endpoint (introduced in [KIP-875](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-875%3A+First-class+offsets+support+in+Kafka+Connect)), type mismatches can occur between offsets passed to `SourceConnector::alterOffsets` and the offsets that are retrieved by connectors / tasks via an instance of `OffsetStorageReader` after the offsets have been modified. In order to prevent this type mismatch that could lead to subtle bugs in connectors, we could serialize + deserialize the offsets using the worker's internal JSON converter before invoking `SourceConnector::alterOffsets`.\r\n\r\n- I've also added a small unit test, verified that the existing offsets API related integration tests are passing, and tested this patch out manually with the `FileStreamSourceConnector`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-12T17:45:14Z","updated_at":"2023-07-14T16:14:04Z","closed_at":"2023-07-14T16:14:04Z","merged_at":"2023-07-14T16:14:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"2b19b7325aac0449de15970b4710a83a51ae29ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14003/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14003/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/14003/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/d1b8b186a8e85d49f70126eefafc886aae3210af","head":{"label":"yashmayya:KAFKA-15182","ref":"KAFKA-15182","sha":"d1b8b186a8e85d49f70126eefafc886aae3210af","user":{"login":"yashmayya","id":23502577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTAyNTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23502577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya","html_url":"https://github.com/yashmayya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":364165183,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjQxNjUxODM=","name":"kafka","full_name":"yashmayya/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yashmayya","id":23502577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTAyNTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23502577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya","html_url":"https://github.com/yashmayya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yashmayya/kafka","description":"Mirror

PR addresses a few issues I noticed with https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12561. To provide some context, https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12561 provided a mechanism to allow successive revoking rebalances as long as those successive rebalances happened after an exponential backoff timer set after 1 successive revoking rebalance. However, there were some things I noticed while doing some testing which need fixing. These are :\r\n\r\n1. [This](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12561/files#diff-e24067b121eb960feebfa099bd9c30382e330eaf5db39302a9d7a50e29b3acb4R446) condition checks if there are lost assignments and exits only if there are no lost assignments and the previous round did not have revocations. Consider a case when a connector or a few connectors are deleted and that leads to load balancing revocations. That would mean that the `revokedInPrevious` flag would be set to true post that. But, on the follow up rebalance, when there are no lost assignments, the condition `lostAssignments.isEmpty() && !revokedInPrevious` would no longer be true because `revokedInPrevious` would be true. This typically culminates in printing this line `No worker seems to have departed the group during the rebalance....` which doesn't make sense. Ideally we should exit this condition as soon as lost assignments are empty. Note that this change as such is harmless but this line's presence can seem very confusing. This can be checked in the logs as follows:\r\n\r\nLog lines after connector deletions:\r\n```\r\n2023-07-12 13:35:30,531] DEBUG [Worker clientId=connect-1, groupId=connect-cluster] Member configs:

Instead now it has been moved to the beginning of the rebalance start loop. That makes the changes a lot easier to reason about with no loss of functionality that the original PR aimed to solved.\r\n\r\n3) There was also an inconsistency in the flag and the counter being used for unsetting the revocations state. Over [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/14000/files#diff-e24067b121eb960feebfa099bd9c30382e330eaf5db39302a9d7a50e29b3acb4L335) only the flag is being unset but at a couple of other places, the counter is also reset. IMO both should be done as we are signifying that this round has no revoking rebalance. This PR addresses that concern as well.\r\n\r\n4) Some general refactoring to move the revoking rebalance unsetting to a separate method.\r\n\r\n5) Modified one of the tests. Note that only of the tests needed modifications which was failing due to 3 IMO. Other tests worked w/o any changes.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-12T11:35:33Z","updated_at":"2025-01-27T03:36:47Z","closed_at":"2025-01-27T03:36:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"464b979abde1ba889fc2e9b331b2d5cc76bd64f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

from:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static <K, V> RangeQuery<K, V> withRange(final K lower, final K upper) {\r\n    return new RangeQuery<>(Optional.of(lower),

Optional.ofNullable(upper));\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTesting strategy: \r\n\r\nSince null values can now be entered in `RangeQuery`s in order to receive full scans, I changed the logic defining `query` starting at [line 1085](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/streams/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/integration/IQv2StoreIntegrationTest.java#L1085) in `IQv2StoreIntegrationTest.java`

RangeQuery.withUpperBound(upper.get());\r\n        } else {\r\n            query = RangeQuery.withNoBounds();\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\nquery = RangeQuery.withRange(lower.orElse(null), upper.orElse(null));\r\n```\r\nbecause different combinations of `isPresent()` in the bounds is no longer necessary.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

want to discuss the topics that were previously discussed in the [PR](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2552).\r\nIn my opinion, using `.invalid` instead of `.local` would be more appropriate.\r\nThe reason is that `.invalid` aligns better with the intended meaning we are using in the tests.\r\n`.local` is a domain reserved for Multicast DNS usage and does not match the current purpose according to [RFC6762](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6762.html#section-3).\r\n[Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207511) actually uses the `.local` domain for its intended purpose and provides guidance in that regard.\r\nSince `.invalid` seems to align with our intended purpose, it would be better to use this domain.\r\n[RFC6761](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6761.html#section-6.4)\r\n[RFC2606](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2606#section-2)\r\n\r\nRegarding the name collision issue with the `.invalid` domain mentioned in the [comment](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2552#issuecomment-280829672), it is likely a problem with older versions of JDK.\r\nAs seen in the [JDK BUG System](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8058932), the .invalid domain performs the functionality of an invalid domain correctly.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I believe that we should use a domain name that

commit does the changes discussed in the KIP-917. Mainly, changes the `RemoteStorageManager` interface in order to return `CustomMetadata` and then ensures these custom metadata are stored, propagated, (de-)serialized correctly along with the standard metadata throughout the whole lifecycle. It introduces the `remote.log.metadata.custom.metadata.max.size` to limit the custom metadata size acceptable by the broker and stop uploading in case a piece of metadata exceeds this limit.\r\n\r\nOn testing:\r\n1. `RemoteLogManagerTest` checks the case when a piece of custom metadata is larger than the configured limit.\r\n2. `RemoteLogSegmentMetadataTest` checks if `createWithUpdates` works correctly, including custom metadata.\r\n3. `RemoteLogSegmentMetadataTransformTest`, `RemoteLogSegmentMetadataSnapshotTransformTest`, and `RemoteLogSegmentMetadataUpdateTransformTest` were added to test the corresponding class (de-)serialization, including custom metadata.\r\n4. `FileBasedRemoteLogMetadataCacheTest` checks if custom metadata are being correctly saved and loaded to a file (indirectly, via `equals`).\r\n5. `RemoteLogManagerConfigTest` checks if the configuration setting is handled correctly.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

ClasspathHelper.forJavaClassPath disregards all intermediate classloaders between the AppClassLoader and the DelegatingClassLoader, when those classloaders may contain plugins.\r\n\r\nInstead, plugins in those intermediate classloaders should be discoverable, for parity with the ServiceLoaderScanner.\r\nThis behavior is tested by adding two assertions to the existing `PluginsTest.assertClassLoaderReadsVersionFromResource` which already sets up a classloader hierarchy that replicates this situation.\r\n\r\nOnce this bug is fixed however, the `PluginsTest.pluginClassLoaderReadVersionFromResourceExistingInParentAndChild` fails for a different reason: the Plugins class begins to load the wrong copy of the ReadVersionFromResource plugin.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the plugin in both the parent loader and the plugin path forces the Plugins infrastructure to make a decision about which to load, when previously it always loaded the only copy visible, the one in the plugin.path. By default, it will prefer classpath plugins when the versions of plugins are equal, causing it to pick the parent copy of the plugin, which fails the test. To tweak the load order, make the ReadVersionFromResource plugin versioned, such that the \"2.0.0\" version is preferred, and is loaded during the test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

the ServiceLoaderScanner, a companion to the ReflectionScanner which does not use reflection to discover plugins.\r\n\r\nThis will be utilized later in the Plugins class for the configurable-discovery-mode startup scanning, and in the connect-plugin-path script for manifest generation. In this PR, the PluginScannerTest is parameterized to ensure that the ServiceLoaderScanner has parity on the TestPlugins. This required adding manifests for the valid TestPlugins.\r\n\r\nAlso fixes a bug where the ServiceLoader handles plugin LinkageErrors differently than Reflections. To summarize:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n* Reflections WARN logs LinkageError internally\r\n* ServiceLoader propagates LinkageError and kills the worker\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n* Reflections behaves the same as before\r\n* JREs with ServiceLoader implementations that make progress before throwing LinkageError:\r\n    * PluginScanner will typically log one error per unique error message, potentially up to 100 errors.\r\n    * If there are >100 consecutive plugins failing with LinkageError, PluginScanner propagates the LinkageError and kills the worker.\r\n* JREs with ServiceLoader implementations that do not make progress before throwing a LinkageError:\r\n    * PluginScanner will typically log a single error, potentially up to 100 errors.\r\n    * PluginScanner will propagate the LinkageError and kills the worker.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

JIRA\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15149\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nFixes a bug where we don't send UMR and LISR requests in dual-write mode when there are new partitions created/added. By mutating `changedPartitions` the code later on in `MigrationPropagator` does not see there are changed partitions and so does not send LISR requests when it should. This is reproducible by running the enhanced version of `ZkMigrationIntegrationTest.testNewAndChangedTopicsInDualWrite` that is updated as part of this PR. So the fix is to create a copy of the partitions metadata so we can mutate it but just locally. This approach of creating a copy is done in other places in the class already, such as here https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/metadata/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/metadata/migration/KRaftMigrationZkWriter.java#L186.\r\n\r\nThere are other options to make sure the code in `KRaftMigrationDriver` can't make side effects that affect other components. For example it'd be possible to enhance `TopicDelta` to create the copy. But this is not consistent with the accessors in other places in the `image` package. Or `TopicDelta` could return an immutable copy using something like `Collections.unmodifiableMap(changedTopics)` but this is problematic because the code in `KRaftMigrationDriver` really does need to mutate the collection and so would have to create a copy anyway. \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nEnhances `ZkMigrationIntegrationTest.testNewAndChangedTopicsInDualWrite` to check the admin client returns the partition increase.

PR fixes two kinds of bugs in the new(ish) rack-aware part of the sticky assignment algorithm:\r\n\r\nFirst, when reassigning \"owned partitions\" to their previous owners, we now have to take the rack placement into account and might not immediately assign a previously-owned partition to its old consumer during this phase. There is a small chance this partition will be assigned to its previous owner during a later stage of the assignment, but if it's not then by definition it has been \"revoked\" and must be removed from the assignment during the adjustment phase of the CooperativeStickyAssignor according to the cooperative protocol. We need to make sure any partitions removed in this way end up in the \"partitionsTransferringOwnership\".\r\n\r\nSecond, the sticky algorithm works in part by keeping track of how many consumers are still \"unfilled\" when they are at the \"minQuota\", meaning we may need to assign one more partition to get to the expected number of consumers at the \"maxQuota\". During the rack-aware round-robin assignment phase, we were not properly clearing the set of unfilled & minQuota consumers once we reached the expected number of \"maxQuota\" consumers (since by definition that means no more minQuota consumers need to or can be given any more partitions since that would bump them up to maxQuota and exceed the expected count). This bug would result in the entire assignment being failed due to a correctness check at the end which verifies that the \"unfilled members\" set is empty before returning the assignment. An IllegalStateException would be thrown, failing the rebalancing and sending the group into an endless rebalancing loop until/unless it was lucky enough to produce a new assignment that didn't hit this

we see a large number of tests suddenly fail in CI. I encountered at least one case where this could be explained.\r\n\r\nTest run: https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Kafka/job/kafka-pr/job/PR-13953/2 \r\n\r\n### why do we have cascading failures?\r\nSequence of events:\r\n1. Some test leaks (does not close properly) the thread `controller-event-thread`\r\n2. This leak is caught at `@AfterAll` method of QuorumTestHarnessScala at https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/701f924352da1225a881f0f78f19ddf51485030a/core/src/test/scala/integration/kafka/server/QuorumTestHarness.scala#L446 \r\n3. The above leads to an assertion failure but does not kill the threads.\r\n4. Other tests that run after it by the same gradle process and before execution check for existing threads all fail due to these leaked threads at https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/701f924352da1225a881f0f78f19ddf51485030a/core/src/test/scala/integration/kafka/server/QuorumTestHarness.scala#L438\r\n5. This leads to a cascading failure\r\n\r\n### what specifically failed in this scenario\r\nIn the scenario that I looked into, the following things occurred:\r\n\r\n1. A ConsumerBounceTest#testConsumptionWithBrokerFailures() fails for unknown reason. I have created a JIRA for it - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15146\r\n```\r\nGradle Test Run :core:integrationTest > Gradle Test Executor 177 > ConsumerBounceTest > testConsumptionWithBrokerFailures() FAILED\r\n    org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.CommitFailedException: Offset commit cannot be completed since the consumer is not part of an active group for auto partition assignment; it is likely that the consumer was kicked out of the group.\r\n        at app//org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.internals.ConsumerCoordinator.sendOffsetCommitRequest(ConsumerCoordinator.java:1351)\r\n        at app//org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.internals.ConsumerCoordinator.commitOffsetsSync(ConsumerCoordinator.java:1188)\r\n        at app//org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer.commitSync(KafkaConsumer.java:1518)\r\n        at app//org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer.commitSync(KafkaConsumer.java:1417)\r\n        at app//org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer.commitSync(KafkaConsumer.java:1374)\r\n        at app//kafka.api.ConsumerBounceTest.consumeWithBrokerFailures(ConsumerBounceTest.scala:109)\r\n        at app//kafka.api.ConsumerBounceTest.testConsumptionWithBrokerFailures(ConsumerBounceTest.scala:81)\r\n```\r\n2. This test has a bug which leads to leak of `daemon-bounce-broker` thread. This leaked thread along with `controller-event-thread` show up in the trace below.\r\n```\r\nGradle Test Run :core:integrationTest > Gradle Test Executor 177 > ConsumerBounceTest > executionError FAILED\r\n    org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: Found 3 unexpected threads during @AfterAll: `controller-event-thread,daemon-bounce-broker-EventThread,Test worker-EventThread` ==> expected: <true> but was: <false>\r\n        at app//org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertionFailureBuilder.build(AssertionFailureBuilder.java:151)\r\n``` \r\n3. All tests run by `Gradle Test Executor 177` after this fail with an error:\r\n```\r\nGradle Test Run :core:integrationTest > Gradle Test Executor 177 > PlaintextConsumerTest > initializationError FAILED\r\n    org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: Found 3 unexpected threads during @BeforeAll: `controller-event-thread,daemon-bounce-broker-EventThread,Test worker-EventThread` ==> expected: <true> but was: <false>\r\n        at app//org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertionFailureBuilder.build(AssertionFailureBuilder.java:151)\r\n        at app//org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertionFailureBuilder.buildAndThrow(AssertionFailureBuilder.java:132)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### what does this PR change?\r\nThis changes fixes the leak of `daemon-bounce-broker` thread. It **does not** fix the leak of `controller-event-thread` which is the root cause of failure in `@AfterAll`. Hence, although this will not fix the flaky problems, but it will be a step in the right direction to prevent thread leaks from impacting tests.\r\n\r\n### Note to reviewers\r\nI would suggest to use \"hide whitespaces\" while reviewing since most of the changes in this PR are simply adding code inside try/finally block.","created_at":"2023-07-04T16:48:22Z","updated_at":"2023-07-14T08:22:22Z","closed_at":"2023-07-14T08:22:14Z","merged_at":"2023-07-14T08:22:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"4960a5ebe90c44b8d0616d328e022dac5067395b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1257747426,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjU3NzQ3NDI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/tests","name":"tests","color":"cfff60","default":false,"description":"Test

the send operation is retried for the remaining records in the batch. There is a bug in the logic for computing the remaining records in a batch which causes records that are filtered out by the task's transformation chain to be re-processed. This will also result in the SourceTask::commitRecord method being called twice for the same record, which can cause certain types of source connectors to fail.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15091:\r\n\r\n> The Javadocs for SourceTask::commit state that the method should:\r\n> \r\n> Commit the offsets, up to the offsets that have been returned by [poll()](https://kafka.apache.org/34/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/source/SourceTask.html#poll()).\r\n> \r\n> However, this is obviously incorrect given how the Connect runtime (when not configured with exactly-once support for source connectors) performs polling and offset commits on separate threads. There's also some extensive discussion on the semantics of that method in [KAFKA-5716](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-5716) where it's made clear that altering the behavior of the runtime to align with the documented semantics of that method is not a viable option.\r\n> \r\n> We should update the Javadocs for this method to state that it does not have anything to do with the offsets returned from SourceTask:poll and is instead just a general, periodically-invoked hook to let the task know that an offset commit has taken place (but with no guarantees as to which offsets have been committed and which ones correspond to still-in-flight records).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

Motivation\r\nThis PR is inspired by https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13913#discussion_r1248010145\r\n\r\nThis is the hint of `removeAll` method in `Set`:\r\n_This implementation determines which is the smaller of this set and the specified collection, by invoking the size method on each. If this set has fewer elements, then the implementation iterates over this set, checking each element returned by the iterator in turn to see if it is contained in the specified collection. If it is so contained, it is removed from this set with the iterator's remove method. If the specified collection has fewer elements, then the implementation iterates over the specified collection, removing from this set each element returned by the iterator, using this set's remove method._\r\n\r\nThat's said, assume that M is the number of elements in the set and N is the number of elements in the List, if the type of the specified collection is `List`, and M<=N, then the time complexity of `removeAll` is O(MN) (because the time complexity of searching in List is O(N)), on the contrary, if N<M, it will search in `Set`, the time complexity is O(N).\r\n\r\nIn `MirrorCheckpointConnector`, `refreshConsumerGroups` method is repeatedly called in a daemon thread. There are two `removeAll` in this method. From a logical point of view, when this method is called in one round, when the number of groups in the source cluster simply increases or decreases, the two `removeAll` execution strategies will always hit the O(MN) situation mentioned above. \r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nTherefore, it is better to change all the variables here to Set type to avoid this \"low performance\".\r\n\r\nThis PR has passed the unit test.","created_at":"2023-07-01T09:04:01Z","updated_at":"2023-07-10T23:09:45Z","closed_at":"2023-07-10T21:35:46Z","merged_at":"2023-07-10T21:35:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"51bc41031b91b16ffcbd95832e8a20a00d3b6f81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4511886370,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABDO3sIg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/mirror-maker-2","name":"mirror-maker-2","color":"1282B2","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13946/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13946/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13946/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/ebcdae1bcee6fc149bbe3c4a9220e2e959e59fbb","head":{"label":"hudeqi:list_to_set","ref":"list_to_set","sha":"ebcdae1bcee6fc149bbe3c4a9220e2e959e59fbb","user":{"login":"hudeqi","id":16536770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTM2Nzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16536770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi","html_url":"https://github.com/hudeqi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":271168921,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzExNjg5MjE=","name":"kafka","full_name":"hudeqi/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hudeqi","id":16536770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTM2Nzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16536770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi","html_url":"https://github.com/hudeqi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hudeqi/kafka","description":"Mirror
