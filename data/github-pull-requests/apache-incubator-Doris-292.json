Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nThis pr is to reduce the probability of OOM.\r\n\r\n1. Previously, process memory statistics were refreshed every 1 second, including `/proc/meminfo`, `/proc/self/status`, `metrics of tcmalloc and jemalloc`, consumption of each type of `mem tracker`, this refresh frequency is very Slow, making it impossible to respond in time before OOM.\r\nNow when the process is about to exceed the limit and the system memory available is insufficient, the refresh frequency will be accelerated, which will not affect performance.\r\n\r\n2. Fixed thread catch bad_alloc, which will also help avoid OOM\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\nWhen running q18 of tpch100, some errors were thrown:\r\n```\r\ndoris_be: /mnt/disk2/gaoxin/ws/doris/be/src/vec/common/pod_array.h:337: T& doris::vectorized::PODArray<T, initial_bytes, TAllocator, pad_right_, pad_left_>::operator[](ssize_t) [with T = unsigned char; long unsigned int initial_bytes = 4096; TAllocator = Allocator<false>; long unsigned int pad_right_ = 15; long unsigned int pad_left_ = 16; ssize_t = long int]: Assertion `(n >= (static_cast<ssize_t>(pad_left_) ? -1 : 0)) && (n <= static_cast<ssize_t>(this->size()))' failed.\r\n7# doris::vectorized::ColumnSelectVector::set_run_length_null_map(std::vector<unsigned short, std::allocator<unsigned short> > const&, unsigned long, doris::vectorized::PODArray<unsigned char, 4096ul, Allocator<false, false>, 15ul, 16ul>*) at /mnt/disk2/gaoxin/ws/doris/be/src/vec/exec/format/parquet/parquet_common.cpp:118\r\n8# doris::vectorized::ScalarColumnReader::_read_values(unsigned long, COW<doris::vectorized::IColumn>::immutable_ptr<doris::vectorized::IColumn>&, std::shared_ptr<doris::vectorized::IDataType const>&, doris::vectorized::ColumnSelectVector&) at /mnt/disk2/gaoxin/ws/doris/be/src/vec/exec/format/parquet/vparquet_column_reader.cpp:177\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe run length of null map is saved as `uint16_t`. Previously, the run length of null map was limited by `batch_size` in the `ParquetReader`, by setting `batch_size = std::min(batch_size, (size_t)USHRT_MAX)`. It works well when the batch size is less than `USHRT_MAX`.\r\nHowever, [Lazy read](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/13917) will merge empty batches until reading a non-empty batch or reaching the EOF of a row group, so the `batch_size` may be greater than `USHRT_MAX` in non-predicate columns.\r\nIn addition, even if the `batch_size` does not exceed `USHRT_MAX`, the adjacent batches may also make the run  length exceed the `USHRT_MAX` in `ColumnSelectVector::get_next_run`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-24T11:58:08Z","updated_at":"2022-12-20T07:28:52Z","closed_at":"2022-11-25T04:22:19Z","merged_at":"2022-11-25T04:22:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"25de068a050ce5bff08467464a6e810efd202315","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nProblem:\r\nWe got following error frequently while `SELECT xxx INTO OUTFILE`:\r\n`ERROR 1064 (HY000): RpcException, msg: Fail to write to broker, broker:TNetworkAddress(hostname=a.b.c.d, port=8111) failed:write() send(): Broken pipe`\r\n\r\nReason:\r\n1. we cache broker thrift client in BE;\r\n2. thrift client check connect `isOpen` only return cached flag, not care the real socket is opened or closed;\r\n3. after we get client from cache, the socket may already closed, then `pwrite` will failed.\r\n\r\nHow to fix:\r\nOther interfaces such as open and close, will reopen and retry again, but `pwrite` do not retry.\r\nAs there are write offset inside `pwrite`, and the broker(server) side also will check the write offset, it is safe to retry `pwrite`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n4. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n5. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n6. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n7. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nin #14482, we implement the feature to keep specific number of meta with same name in catalog recycle bin.\r\nBut it will cause meta replay bug.\r\nBecause every time we drop db/table/partition, it will try to erase a certain number of meta with same name.\r\nAnd when replay \"drop\" edit log, it will do same thing. But the number of meta to erase it based on current config value,\r\nnot persist in edit log, so it will cause inconsistency with \"drop\" and \"replay drop\".\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I move the \"erase meta with same name\" logic to the daemon thread of catalog recycle bin.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nProblem desc:\r\nWhile we call `SELECT xxx INTO OUTFILE`,  if we output data file success, we also write an empty `SUCCESS` file.\r\nBut now the problem is:\r\n1. if we write data file failed, we also write out an empty `SUCCESS` file;\r\n2. if we write data file success, we write out the empty `SUCCESS` file twice;\r\n\r\nWhy the problem:\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/5489, we refractor _close_file_writer, but not change the caller.\r\nSo we will create `SUCCESS` file once inside `close` function, and the other call while we deconstruct `FileResultWriter`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n4. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n5. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n6. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n7. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-24T09:41:58Z","updated_at":"2022-11-28T07:46:42Z","closed_at":"2022-11-28T07:46:42Z","merged_at":"2022-11-28T07:46:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"73a600fba8381aeebbf886c00abda3c5896fd630","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/14550/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/14550/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/14550/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/statuses/cefb14804ff75dcc29e21ed46815d31f0e58dcea","head":{"label":"cambyzju:fix-1124","ref":"fix-1124","sha":"cefb14804ff75dcc29e21ed46815d31f0e58dcea","user":{"login":"cambyzju","id":10771715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzcxNzE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10771715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cambyzju","html_url":"https://github.com/cambyzju","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cambyzju/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cambyzju/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cambyzju/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cambyzju/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cambyzju/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cambyzju/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cambyzju/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cambyzju/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cambyzju/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":442372052,"node_id":"R_kgDOGl4P1A","name":"incubator-doris","full_name":"cambyzju/incubator-doris","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cambyzju","id":10771715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzcxNzE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10771715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cambyzju","html_url":"https://github.com/cambyzju","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cambyzju/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cambyzju/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cambyzju/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cambyzju/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cambyzju/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cambyzju/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cambyzju/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cambyzju/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cambyzju/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cambyzju/incubator-doris","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nPreviously, we use \"Date\" type for `cooldownTime` in StoragePolicy.\r\nBut the serialization method of Date type in Gson is different in java8 and java11, which may cause inconsistent meta error.\r\n\r\nThis PR use Long to save `cooldownTime`.\r\nAnd notice that in FE, the cooldownTime is saved in milliseconds, and in BE, it is saved in seconds.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\nI add `jdbc catalog` for doris multi-catalog feature.\r\nCurrently, the `jdbc catalog` only supports `MYSQL` DBMS.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n1. support for `postgre` DB\r\n2. Support for other databases.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nFor `jdbc catalog`, we can create catalog like:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE CATALOG jdbc4 PROPERTIES (\r\n    \"type\"=\"jdbc\",\r\n    \"jdbc.user\"=\"root\",\r\n    \"jdbc.password\"=\"123456\",\r\n    \"jdbc.jdbc_url\" = \"jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:13396/demo?yearIsDateType=false\",\r\n    \"jdbc.driver_url\" = \"file:/mnt/disk2/ftw/tools/jar/mysql-connector-java-5.1.47/mysql-connector-java-5.1.47.jar\",\r\n    \"jdbc.driver_class\" = \"com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\"\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n`yearIsDateType` is a param of jdbc:\r\nIf yearIsDateType configuration property is set to false, then the returned object type is java.sql.Short. If set to true (the default), then the returned object is of type java.sql.Date with the date set to January 1st, at midnight.\r\nTo compat with mysql, we force the use of `yearIsDateType=false` in `FE`. if user sets `yearIsDateType=true`, doris FE will force to change `yearIsDateType=false`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n3. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n5. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n6. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-23T12:03:43Z","updated_at":"2023-02-27T06:52:00Z","closed_at":"2022-11-30T03:28:09Z","merged_at":"2022-11-30T03:28:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"9272680d00e7c349555351351287a88e17bf7740","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1691596842,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjkxNTk2ODQy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/area/load","name":"area/load","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #14517 \r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nThis action is used to obtain the table structure information of the specified table.\r\n```\r\ncurl -X GET -u xxx:xxx http://fe_host:http_port/api/{db}/{table}/_schema\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut for Non-OLAP table, this action can not work such as `view`. For example:\r\n```\r\n{\"msg\":\"Error\",\"code\":1,\"data\":\"errCode = 7, detailMessage = table type is not OLAP, tableName=xxx, type=VIEW\",\"count\":0}\r\n```\r\nThis patch is to support request the table schema of Non-OLAP table through this action.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

of source file.\r\n\r\n4.\r\nAdd a temp property \"use_new_load_scan_node\" of broker load to make regression test happy.\r\nSo that we can use new load scan node for a certain job and avoid setting global FE config.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.
