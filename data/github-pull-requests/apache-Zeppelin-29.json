So we need to clear the cache by removing `zeppelin-web/bower_components` in caching list in `.travis.yml`. \r\n\r\nLet's see the master branch's CI turns to green light :)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of

Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\r\n* Does this needs documentation? no\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-07T03:06:24Z","updated_at":"2017-03-07T07:36:30Z","closed_at":"2017-03-07T05:04:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8d218b0754ec6a32bcc474fb9220e86a2b3a95e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2102/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2102/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2102/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/05c802c4ab51a6292616c8369afa9cb8cd05d72b","head":{"label":"AhyoungRyu:makeCIHappy","ref":"makeCIHappy","sha":"05c802c4ab51a6292616c8369afa9cb8cd05d72b","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44792338,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDc5MjMzOA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"AhyoungRyu/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

Spec\r\n\r\n`AdvancedTransformation` requires `spec` which includes axis and parameter details for charts.\r\n\r\n- Let's create 2 sub-charts called `simple-line` and `step-line`.\r\n- Each sub chart can have different `axis` and `parameter` depending on their requirements.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  constructor(targetEl, config) {\r\n    super(targetEl, config)\r\n\r\n    const spec = {\r\n      charts:

|\r\n|`dimension` | `single` | Axis can contains only 1 column |\r\n|`dimension` | `multiple` | Axis can contains multiple columns |\r\n|`axisType` | `key` | Column(s) in this axis will be used as `key` like in `PivotTransformation`. These columns will be served in `column.key` |\r\n|`axisType` | `aggregator` | Column(s) in this axis will be used as `value` like in `PivotTransformation`. These columns will be served in `column.aggregator` |\r\n|`axisType` | `group` | Column(s) in this axis will be used as `group` like in `PivotTransformation`. These columns will be served in `column.group` |\r\n|`axisType` | (string) | Any string value can be used here. These columns will be served in `column.custom` |\r\n|`maxAxisCount` | (int) | The maximum column count that this axis can contains. (unlimited if `undefined`) |\r\n|`valueType` | (string) | Describe the value type just for annotation |\r\n\r\nHere is an example.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n          axis: {\r\n            'xAxis': { dimension: 'multiple', axisType: 'key',  },\r\n            'yAxis': { dimension: 'multiple', axisType: 'aggregator'},\r\n            'category': { dimension: 'multiple', axisType: 'group', maxAxisCount: 2, valueType: 'string', },\r\n          },\r\n```\r\n\r\n####  API Details: Parameter Spec\r\n\r\n\r\n| Field Name | Available Values (type) | Description |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n|`valueType` | `string` | Parameter which has string value |\r\n|`valueType` | `int` | Parameter which has int value |\r\n|`valueType` | `float` | Parameter which has float value |\r\n|`valueType` | `boolean` | Parameter which has boolean value used with `checkbox` widget usually |\r\n|`valueType` | `JSON` | Parameter which has JSON value used with `textarea` widget usually. `defaultValue` should be `\"\"` (empty string). This ||`defaultValue` | (any) | Default value of this parameter. `JSON` type should have `\"\"` (empty string) |\r\n|`description` | (string) | Description of this parameter. This value will be parsed as HTML for pretty output |\r\n|`widget` | `input` |  Use [input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) widget.

The return value will depend on the transformation method type. \r\n\r\n```js\r\n    const spec = {\r\n      charts: {\r\n        'simple': {\r\n          /** default value of `transform.method` is the flatten cube.  */\r\n          axis: { ... },\r\n          parameter: { ... }\r\n        },\r\n\r\n        'cube-group': {\r\n          transform: { method: 'cube', },\r\n          axis: { ... },\r\n          parameter: { ... },\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        'no-group': {\r\n          transform: { method: 'raw', },\r\n          axis: { ... },\r\n          parameter: { ... },\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n| Field Name | Available Values (type) | Description |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n|`method` | `object` |  designed for [amcharts: serial](https://www.amcharts.com/demos/date-based-data/) | \r\n|`method` | `array` | designed for [highcharts: column](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/demo/column-basic/) |\r\n|`method` | `drill-down` | designed for [highcharts: drill-down](http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/demo/column-drilldown/) |\r\n|`method` | `raw` | will return the original `tableData.rows` | \r\n\r\nWhatever you specified as `transform.method`, the `transformer` value will be always function for lazy computation. \r\n\r\n```js\r\n// advanced-transformation.util#getTransformer\r\n\r\n  if (transformSpec.method === 'raw') {\r\n    transformer = () => { return rows; }\r\n  } else if (transformSpec.method === 'array') {\r\n    transformer = () => {\r\n      ...\r\n      return { ... }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Feature Details: Automatic parameter parsing\r\n\r\nAdvanced transformation will parse parameter values automatically based on their type: `int`, `float`, `string`, `JSON`\r\n\r\n- See also `advanced-transformation-util.js#parseParameter`\r\n\r\n#### Feature Details: re-initialize the whole configuration based on spec hash\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// advanced-transformation-util#initializeConfig\r\n\r\n  const currentVersion = JSON.stringify(spec)\r\n  if (!config.spec || !config.spec.version || config.spec.version !== currentVersion) {\r\n    spec.version = currentVersion\r\n    // reset config...\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Feature Details: Shared Axes\r\n\r\nIf you set `sharedAxis` to `true` in chart specification, then these charts will share their axes. (default is `false`)\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    const spec = {\r\n      charts: {\r\n        'column': {\r\n          transform: { method: 'array', },\r\n          sharedAxis: true,\r\n          axis: { ... },\r\n          parameter: { ... },\r\n        },\r\n\r\n        'stacked': {\r\n          transform: { method: 'array', },\r\n          sharedAxis: true,\r\n          axis: { ... }\r\n          parameter: { ... },\r\n        },\r\n```\r\n\r\n![sharedaxis](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4968473/24207116/6999ad8a-0f63-11e7-8b61-273b712612fc.gif)\r\n\r\n#### API Details: Usage in Visualization#render()\r\n\r\nLet's assume that we want to create 2 sub-charts called `basic` and `no-group`.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/1ambda/zeppelin-ultimate-line-chart (an practical example)\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  drawBasicChart(parameter, column, transformer) { \r\n    const { ... } = transformer()\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  drawNoGroupChart(parameter, column, transformer) { \r\n    const { ... } = transformer()\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render(data) {\r\n    const { chart, parameter, column, transformer, } = data\r\n\r\n    if (chart === 'basic') {\r\n      this.drawBasicChart(parameter, column, transformer)\r\n    } else if (chart === 'no-group') {\r\n      this.drawNoGroupChart(parameter, column, transformer)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Feature]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\nNONE\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\n[ZEPPELIN-2217](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2217)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\n1.

What is this PR for?\r\nWhen deploying Zeppelin in private Cloud or within closed networks, it happens that Maven Central isn't directly reachable, so we want to configure our own proxy and do not have to wait for minutes long timeouts when importing external libraries. It is anyhow worth to let user configure maven central repo instead of hardcoding the URL.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nOutline the steps to test the PR here.\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?\r\n* Does this needs documentation?\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-03T10:45:49Z","updated_at":"2017-03-17T16:50:55Z","closed_at":"2017-03-17T15:58:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"06ca960ab5c001708e2b36dc344ed6ee889d0800","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2093/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2093/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2093/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/af9accc0768a0818b90f3b0ec0e9b0505eaef27f","head":{"label":"andreaTP:mavenRepo","ref":"mavenRepo","sha":"af9accc0768a0818b90f3b0ec0e9b0505eaef27f","user":{"login":"andreaTP","id":5792097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3OTIwOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5792097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaTP","html_url":"https://github.com/andreaTP","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaTP/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaTP/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaTP/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaTP/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaTP/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaTP/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaTP/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaTP/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaTP/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83691136,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzY5MTEzNg==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"andreaTP/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andreaTP","id":5792097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3OTIwOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5792097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaTP","html_url":"https://github.com/andreaTP","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaTP/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaTP/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaTP/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaTP/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaTP/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaTP/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaTP/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaTP/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andreaTP/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andreaTP/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nWhen deploying Zeppelin in private Cloud or within closed networks, it happens that Maven Central isn't directly reachable, so we want to configure our own proxy and do not have to wait for minutes long timeouts when importing external libraries. It is anyhow worth to let user configure maven central repo instead of hardcoding the URL.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nOutline the steps to test the PR here.\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?\r\n* Does this needs

What is this PR for?\r\nUser with insufficient privileges can still restore files by renaming files in/out of Trash\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix]\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* [ZEPPELIN-2167](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2167)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n - Create a notebook \"test_nb\" as bob.\r\n - Delete the notebook\r\n - Login as mary and try restoring \"test_nb\" from Trash folder. The system correctly complains of insufficient privileges.\r\n - Open the \"test_nb\" notebook from Trash folder. The notebook opens with title \"~Trash/test_nb\".\r\n - Edit the title and remove the prefix \"~Trash\".\r\n\r\nIf you now look at the list of notebooks there is no file \"test_nb\" in Trash.\r\nInterestingly when you try and delete the recently moved file from Trash it complains that mary does not have privileges to delete it. Edit the title of that notebook to \"~Trash/test_nb\" and it goes back to Trash folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? N/A\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? N/A\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

It would be better to use `PYSPARK_PYTHON` and `PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON`  which is what spark use officially.  So that user can define their own python exec in interpreter setting for different version of python rather than defining them `zeppelin-env.sh` which is shared globally. \r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[ Improvement ]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2195\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nTested it manually. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\npom variables such as `${scala.version}` are not replaced to value when you do `mvn install`.\r\nThis makes leaf poms to look for this value in parent pom, which is always `2.10.5` for `${scala.version}` and it causes scala library dependency conflict. For example, zeppelin-flink_2.11 will have scala 2.10.5 as dependency.\r\nThis PR fixes this problem by using maven flatten plugin.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-2139](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2139)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n```\r\n$ ./dev/change_scala_version.sh 2.11\r\n$ mvn clean install -pl 'zeppelin-server,zeppelin-zengine,zeppelin-interpreter,flink' -am -DskipRat -DskipTests -Pscala-2.11\r\n```\r\nOpen `~/.m2/repository/org/apache/zeppelin/zeppelin-flink_2.11/0.8.0-SNAPSHOT/zeppelin-flink_2.11-0.8.0-SNAPSHOT.pom` file and see if scala related libraries dependency version is set to 2.11.7\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\r\n* Does this needs documentation? no\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-23T09:44:12Z","updated_at":"2017-03-07T05:06:02Z","closed_at":"2017-03-07T05:06:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"37645cd87af484475f8497136bd17ae6c36ab517","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2059/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2059/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2059/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/62d852a75c0261fad645b85ca8a98843c01158b8","head":{"label":"minahlee:ZEPPELIN-2139","ref":"ZEPPELIN-2139","sha":"62d852a75c0261fad645b85ca8a98843c01158b8","user":{"login":"minahlee","id":8503346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDMzNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8503346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee","html_url":"https://github.com/minahlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33116265,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzExNjI2NQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"minahlee/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"minahlee","id":8503346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDMzNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8503346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee","html_url":"https://github.com/minahlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/minahlee/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nAdding endpoint in NotebookRepoRestApi to trigger reload and broadcast of the note list.\r\nSending a GET request to /api/notebook-repositories/reload will trigger a reload of the note list, just like the reload button does on the homepage.\r\nQ: If you think this endpoint belongs to another API (NotebookRestApi?), let me know.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n<https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2114>\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n0. add (or remove) a note in the notebook repository\r\n1. curl -X GET http://HOST:PORT/api/notebook-repository/reload\r\n2. verify that you the note list in Zeppelin's home page now contains (or does not contain anymore) the note.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? NO\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? NO\r\n* Does this needs documentation? NotebookRepoRestApi does not have documentation yet. Could add it in another PR if needed.\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-20T15:42:51Z","updated_at":"2017-02-27T11:45:51Z","closed_at":"2017-02-27T11:45:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"72e9546c4463d9e7ea1ad12e295d64592496fdfd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2043/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2043/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2043/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/b1d741a661fe9f6755f33f308107cdf1cd6675bc","head":{"label":"Remilito:ZEPPELIN-2114","ref":"ZEPPELIN-2114","sha":"b1d741a661fe9f6755f33f308107cdf1cd6675bc","user":{"login":"Remilito","id":8293897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTM4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8293897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito","html_url":"https://github.com/Remilito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":81946614,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTk0NjYxNA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"Remilito/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Remilito","id":8293897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTM4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8293897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito","html_url":"https://github.com/Remilito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Remilito/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\n* Make Helium pkgs sortable\r\nFor now, we have 3 types of Helium packages: `VISUALIZATION`, `SPELL` and `APPLICATION`.\r\n`VISUALIZATION` and `SPELL` type of pkgs can be published [NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). Likewise, `APPLICATION` type pkg can be registered in [Maven central repository](http://search.maven.org/). \r\nBut all available Helium packages are not sorted and shown in random order in Helium menu.\r\nTo do this, I put \"NPM Packages\" & \"Maven Artifacts\" button at top-right corner of Helium menu. \r\n\r\n* Introduce \"INTERPRETER\" type\r\nAs a first step of [ZEPPELIN-1993: Install interpreter from Helium menu](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1993), I added `INTERPRETER` type as a new Helium pkg type. Like [ZEPPELIN-1973](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1973) did, we can retrieve Maven artifact(which has `zeppelin-interpreter` as its dependency) info and save it to Helium online registry as well. \r\nFor more detailed explanation, please see [ZEPPELIN-1993](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1993) and [ZEPPELIN-2110](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2110)'s description.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* [ZEPPELIN-2109](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2109) : Make Helium packages sortable in Helium menu\r\n* [ZEPPELIN-2110](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2110) : List community & 3rd party interpreter registered at Maven central repo in Helium menu \r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nTo see how `INTERPRETER` type can be shown in Helium menu,\r\n\r\n1. Replace temporarily [ZeppelinConfiguration.java#L46](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/conf/ZeppelinConfiguration.java#L46) with [this url](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AhyoungRyu/spark-notebook-example/master/helium-test.json)\r\n\r\n2. Build \\w below command and restart\r\n```\r\n $ mvn clean package -DskipTests -pl 'zeppelin-zengine, zeppelin-server, zeppelin-interpreter'\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Start web dev server under `ZEPPELIN_HOME/zeppelin-web` and browse `localhost:9000`\r\n```\r\n$ yarn run dev:helium\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Go to Helium menu\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n - How's it look?\r\n![record](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/23219279/02fc234e-f962-11e6-86a9-30e7dc0953aa.gif)\r\n\r\n -

What is this PR for?\r\nAdding endpoint in NotebookRepoRestApi to trigger reload and broadcast of the note list.\r\nSending a GET request to /api/notebook-repositories/reload will trigger a reload of the note list, just like the reload button does on the homepage.\r\nQ: If you think this endpoint belongs to another API (NotebookRestApi?), let me know.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n<https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2114>\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n0. add (or remove) a note in the notebook repository\r\n1. curl -X GET http://HOST:PORT/api/notebook-repository/reload\r\n2. verify that you the note list in Zeppelin's home page now contains (or does not contain anymore) the note.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? NO\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? NO\r\n* Does this needs documentation? NotebookRepoRestApi does not have documentation yet. Could add it in another PR if needed.\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-15T16:59:15Z","updated_at":"2017-02-20T14:44:33Z","closed_at":"2017-02-20T14:41:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"245dbebdf83e39abe0feebc35cb06ac97a9d83d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2023/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2023/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2023/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/e380fe4c75827e7f17c0d8e9a9909bf4de25d6f4","head":{"label":"Remilito:ZEPPELIN-2114","ref":"ZEPPELIN-2114","sha":"e380fe4c75827e7f17c0d8e9a9909bf4de25d6f4","user":{"login":"Remilito","id":8293897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTM4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8293897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito","html_url":"https://github.com/Remilito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":81946614,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTk0NjYxNA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"Remilito/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Remilito","id":8293897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTM4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8293897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito","html_url":"https://github.com/Remilito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Remilito/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nAdding endpoint in NotebookRepoRestApi to trigger reload and broadcast of the note list.\r\nSending a GET request to /api/notebook-repositories/reload will trigger a reload of

it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n<https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2114>\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n0. add (or remove) a note in the notebook repository\r\n1. curl -x GET http://HOST:PORT/api/notebook-repository/reload\r\n2. verify that you the note list in Zeppelin's home page now contains (or does not contain anymore) the note.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? NO\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? NO\r\n* Does this needs documentation? NotebookRepoRestApi does not have documentation yet. Could add it in another PR if needed.\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-14T14:02:56Z","updated_at":"2017-02-15T14:36:22Z","closed_at":"2017-02-15T14:36:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb8a70b4d1672f0da07c3c9d8ae32d26c638f13a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2018/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2018/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2018/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/c610d18dc0623944005e36794bf81c870dabd24e","head":{"label":"Remilito:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"c610d18dc0623944005e36794bf81c870dabd24e","user":{"login":"Remilito","id":8293897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTM4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8293897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito","html_url":"https://github.com/Remilito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":81946614,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTk0NjYxNA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"Remilito/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Remilito","id":8293897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTM4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8293897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito","html_url":"https://github.com/Remilito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remilito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Remilito/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nPySparkInterpreter (and PySparkInterpreterMatplotlibTest, SparkInterpreterTest, SparkSqlInterpreterTest) test does not terminate SparkInterpreter after test end.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, keeping SparkInterpreter alive was designed to prevent create/destroy SparkInterpreter multiple times in various tests, because it takes some time.\r\n\r\nHowever, that is somehow misbehaving and getting problems like\r\n\r\n1. starting another SparkInterpreter before one SparkInterpreter terminates\r\n2. Does not finish PySparkInterpreter process explicitly cause py4j client somehow creates a lot of connection attempt, that consumes all capacity of systems port open, and make next SparkInterpreter start fail.\r\n\r\nThis PR terminates SparkInterpreter after test class finishes, to prevent above behavior.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nHot Fix\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Terminate SparkInterpreter after each test class\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1746\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nCI becomes green\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\r\n* Does this needs documentation? no\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-13T23:30:32Z","updated_at":"2017-02-14T09:19:31Z","closed_at":"2017-02-14T09:19:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1b9362b6d841a2a63b77bc973dd84b83b0f4a0b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2017/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2017/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2017/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/e6ba4e1414b6cedaddbcfbd251e721a9d8e91cc4","head":{"label":"Leemoonsoo:ZEPPELIN-1746","ref":"ZEPPELIN-1746","sha":"e6ba4e1414b6cedaddbcfbd251e721a9d8e91cc4","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32886931,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjg4NjkzMQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"Leemoonsoo/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\n`testSchedulePoolUsage()` test checks that jobs can be executed several times in a row using a cron expression.\r\n\r\nIt failed sometimes when it checked job completion by monitoring `job.dateFinished` and then tried to assert that `job.status` is `FINISHED`. It was not always true because `job.status` is changed after `job.dateFinished`.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] We need to catch job completion by checking `job.status` instead of `job.dateFinished`.\r\n* [ ] It is better to catch job completion by adding job status change listener instead of using `Thread.sleep(..)` in a test method.\r\n* [ ] We can make this test simpler by removing a check that a job will not run after a cron expressin is removed.

OOM error from spark\r\nRestarting of interpreter will not help. The only recovery is restarting zeppelin server\r\nI have not enumerated all the cases in which sc can go down. There might be other cases.\r\nIn this PR, restarting interpreter automatically\r\n\r\nEdit: Restart of interpreter works fine.

What is this PR for?\r\nCurrently there is no link to go back to [zeppelin.apache.org](https://zeppelin.apache.org) in each docs site.

And linked [production_url](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/docs/_config.yml#L34) and [BASE_PATH](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/docs/_config.yml#L62) to each of them.
