Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- _(replace with a link to AIRFLOW-X)_\n\nPer Apache guidelines you need to create a [Jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/).\n\nTesting Done:\n- Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please\n  specify why you think this is not required. We like to improve our\n  coverage so a non existing test is even a better reason to include one.\n\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\n- Your PR's title must reference an issue on \n  [Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \n  For example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \n  issue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\n- Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \n  Summarized as follows:\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\n  4.

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-509\n\nPer Apache guidelines you need to create a [Jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/).\n\nTesting Done:\n- Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please\n  specify why you think this is not required. We like to improve our\n  coverage so a non existing test is even a better reason to include one.\n\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\n- Your PR's title must reference an issue on \n  [Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \n  For example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \n  issue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\n- Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \n  Summarized as follows:\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs.

return fractional seconds.

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-499\n\nPer Apache guidelines you need to create a [Jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/).\n\nTesting Done:\n- Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please\n  specify why you think this is not required. We like to improve our\n  coverage so a non existing test is even a better reason to include one.\n\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\n- Your PR's title must reference an issue on \n  [Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \n  For example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \n  issue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\n- Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \n  Summarized as follows:\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how\n","created_at":"2016-09-09T16:45:55Z","updated_at":"2016-12-22T19:28:17Z","closed_at":"2016-10-16T21:43:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"435bfb5e8e49b11305777baced77faa2cedacdea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1787/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1787/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1787/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/09079cf3c4338afaa4827a951aaff7ae11f1192c","head":{"label":"aedoran:master","ref":"master","sha":"09079cf3c4338afaa4827a951aaff7ae11f1192c","user":{"login":"aedoran","id":653573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MzU3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/653573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aedoran","html_url":"https://github.com/aedoran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aedoran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aedoran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aedoran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aedoran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aedoran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aedoran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aedoran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aedoran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aedoran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67748869,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Nzc0ODg2OQ==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"aedoran/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aedoran","id":653573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MzU3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/653573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aedoran","html_url":"https://github.com/aedoran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aedoran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aedoran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aedoran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aedoran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aedoran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aedoran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aedoran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aedoran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aedoran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aedoran/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- AIRFLOW-489\n\nPer Apache guidelines you need to create a [Jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/).\n\nTesting Done:\n- to be added\n\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\n- Your PR's title must reference an issue on \n  [Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \n  For example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \n  issue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\n- Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \n  Summarized as follows:\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how\n     This implements a framework for API calls to Airflow. Currently\n     all access is done by cli or web ui. Especially in the context\n     of the cli this raises security concerns which can be alleviated\n     with a secured API call over the wire.\n\nSecondly integration with other systems is a bit harder if you have\nto call a cli. For public facing endpoints JSON is used.\n\nAs an example the trigger_dag functionality is now made into a\nAPI call.\n\nBackwards compat is retained by switching to a LocalClient.\n- Docs and tests to be added\n- Kerberos integration works\n","created_at":"2016-09-06T15:16:57Z","updated_at":"2016-11-28T19:23:02Z","closed_at":"2016-11-27T19:14:14Z","merged_at":"2016-11-27T19:14:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"d5ac6bd9d0257683d8b2d0b200a513b2f43ce5dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1783/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1783/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1783/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/d5ac6bd9d0257683d8b2d0b200a513b2f43ce5dc","head":{"label":"bolkedebruin:api_v3","ref":"api_v3","sha":"d5ac6bd9d0257683d8b2d0b200a513b2f43ce5dc","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38505714,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODUwNTcxNA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"bolkedebruin/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin/airflow","description":"AirFlow

on Apache release `1.7.2`, which is actually soon after `1.7.1_6`, plus some cherry picking around apache licensing requirements. \n\nVersion number used to be maintained in two files (setup.py and airflow.**init**), that's because setup.py can't import the package to figure out the version if the package isn't installed yet... that is not the case anymore by introducing a `airflow.version` module.\n\nThe first commit will be cherry picked into the `1.7.2` release, and the second one starts using `dev` releases `1.7.2.dev0` to help identify when people are making their own builds off master. Version numbers for dev releases can be bumped at any

public GCS tests yet.\n\nAdds support for the new autodetect parameter when loading BigQuery tables. This will attempt to generate schemas-on-read when working with CSV and JSON files, so no explicit schema has to be passed.\n\ncc @criccomini @alexvanboxel this has only one small change that is _potentially_ not backwards compatible -- the order of `source_uris` and `schema_fields` is reversed in the `run_load()` method of `BigQueryHook`, because source_uris is required but schema_fields now has a default (None). This will impact you if you're calling the hook's `run_load()` directly with positional arguments, but it won't affect anyone using Operators because all arguments are passed by

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-435\n\nOne of the scheduler default values may make it look like it's not scheduling as fast as it should, so changing the default so that it processes DAG definition files as fast as possible.\n\nTesting Done:\n- Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please\n  specify why you think this is not required. We like to improve our\n  coverage so a non existing test is even a better reason to include one.\n\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\n- Your PR's title must reference an issue on \n  [Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \n  For example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \n  issue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\n- Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \n  Summarized as follows:\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how\n","created_at":"2016-08-25T01:14:30Z","updated_at":"2016-11-15T23:40:20Z","closed_at":"2016-11-15T23:40:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"86b20b8fae1091c961497b531a3c2b281035c34b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1761/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1761/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1761/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/6ef2b221535491ee444c5f65aebaa34fe557fd6c","head":{"label":"plypaul:plypaul_set_default_file_refresh_rate","ref":"plypaul_set_default_file_refresh_rate","sha":"6ef2b221535491ee444c5f65aebaa34fe557fd6c","user":{"login":"plypaul","id":5704934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDQ5MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5704934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul","html_url":"https://github.com/plypaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":56650292,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NjY1MDI5Mg==","name":"airflow","full_name":"plypaul/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"plypaul","id":5704934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDQ5MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5704934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul","html_url":"https://github.com/plypaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/plypaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/plypaul/airflow","description":"Airflow

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-409\n\nThis PR avoids the pattern of:\n\n```\nlogging.getLogger().handlers = []  # Blow away existing root handlers.\nlogging.basicConfig(...)  # Install a simple stream handler to standard error/out.\n```\n\nAnd instead calls `addHandler` as appropriate.  This also avoids changing the root logger's log level and only modifies handler log levels.\n\nTesting Done:\n- Added unit tests.\n- Tested out CLI commands to verify logging still functioned.\n","created_at":"2016-08-17T21:51:26Z","updated_at":"2016-12-06T14:54:01Z","closed_at":"2016-12-06T14:54:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4e79ea57bce0285887de30afff78faef02321850","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1745/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1745/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1745/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/f80bcfe167eaa1a3c71f6edfacc1003f73da0dee","head":{"label":"mtdewulf:airflow-409-replace_loggers","ref":"airflow-409-replace_loggers","sha":"f80bcfe167eaa1a3c71f6edfacc1003f73da0dee","user":{"login":"mtdewulf","id":3631601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MzE2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3631601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdewulf","html_url":"https://github.com/mtdewulf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdewulf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdewulf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdewulf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdewulf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdewulf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdewulf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdewulf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdewulf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdewulf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":64488715,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NDQ4ODcxNQ==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"mtdewulf/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mtdewulf","id":3631601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MzE2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3631601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdewulf","html_url":"https://github.com/mtdewulf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdewulf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdewulf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdewulf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdewulf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdewulf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdewulf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdewulf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdewulf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtdewulf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mtdewulf/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

guidelines you need to create a [Jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/).\n\nTesting Done:\n- Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please\n  specify why you think this is not required. We like to improve our\n  coverage so a non existing test is even a better reason to include one.\n\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\n- Your PR's title must reference an issue on \n  [Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \n  For example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \n  issue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\n- Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \n  Summarized as follows:\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how\n     `scheduler_interval` =>

adding a new connection\n- deleting connection(s)\n- listing existing connections\n\nOriginally intend to wait after REST API is introduced, but given that will take some time to streamline, I think it would benefit the community to support this via cli for now.\n","created_at":"2016-08-14T22:19:08Z","updated_at":"2016-10-06T03:34:15Z","closed_at":"2016-10-06T03:34:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"70133ab95be244b467c62b393fbe6bfbb2a274f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1734/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1734/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1734/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/afa46ecd1efa16d69412aea70ec1ef274970905c","head":{"label":"jgao54:add_connection_to_cli","ref":"add_connection_to_cli","sha":"afa46ecd1efa16d69412aea70ec1ef274970905c","user":{"login":"jgao54","id":17896160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk2MTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17896160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54","html_url":"https://github.com/jgao54","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54232830,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDIzMjgzMA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"jgao54/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jgao54","id":17896160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk2MTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17896160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54","html_url":"https://github.com/jgao54","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgao54/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jgao54/airflow","description":"Airflow

--local`) now handles SIGTERM and SIGINT properly by propagating them to its children (which is an `airflow run` command).\n- `airflow worker` now runs celery as a subprocess instead of directly\n- `airflow worker` now handles SIGINT and SIGTERM; there was code previously to catch them but it was never called because celery installs its own signal handlers\n- `airflow worker` handles SIGINT/SIGTERM by sending SIGTERM to `airflow run` commands\n#### Testing Done\n- [ ] Run airflow worker, wait for it to receive tasks, then send sigterm to it\n- [ ] Run airflow worker, wait for it

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-329\n\nTesting Done:\n- Added a unit test to core tests, tests that dag_stats table is appropriately updated after dagrun creation and state change\n  -Added sanity check for '/dag_stats' and '/task_stats' API endpoints\n\nRenamed 'Recent Statuses' to 'Recent Tasks'. Created 'DAG Stats' column. Created a cache table dag_stats to hold data for 'DAG Stats' column with dirty bit for each row. Upon dagrun creation, state change, or deletion via web UI, appropriate rows will have dirty set to true and then dirty rows will be refreshed with up to date data. Upon execution of `airflow webserver` command, all rows in dag_stat will be dirtied and cleaned.\n\nAPI endpoints in views.py have also been changed. '/dag_stats' has been renamed to '/task_stats', and endpoint reused for the 'DAG Stats'

accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-149\r\n\r\nHere is the original PR with Max's LGTM: https://github.com/aoen/incubator-airflow/pull/1\r\nSince then I have made some fixes but this PR is essentially the same. It could definitely use more\r\neyes as there are likely still issues.\r\n\r\n**Goals**\r\n- Simplify, consolidate, and make consistent the logic of whether or not a task should be run\r\n- Provide a view/better logging that gives insight into why a task instance is not currently running\r\n  (no more viewing the scheduler logs to find out why a task instance isn't running for the majority\r\n  of cases):\r\n  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1592778/17637621/aa669f5e-6099-11e6-81c2-d988d2073aac.png)\r\n\r\n**Notable Functional Changes**\r\n- Webserver view + task_failing_deps CLI command to explain why a given task instance isn't being\r\n  run by the scheduler\r\n- Running a backfill in the command line and running a task in the UI will now display detailed\r\n  error messages based on which dependencies were not met for a task instead of appearing to succeed\r\n  but actually failing silently\r\n- Maximum task concurrency and pools are now respected by backfills\r\n- Backfill now has the equivalent of the old force flag to run even for successful tasks\r\n  This will break one use case:\r\n  Using pools to restrict some resource on airflow executors themselves (rather than an externa\r\n  l resource like a DB), e.g. some task uses 60% of cpu on a worker so we restrict that task's pool\r\n  size to 1 to prevent two of the tasks from running on the same host. When backfilling a task of\r\n  this type, now the backfill will wait on the pool to have slots open up before running the task\r\n  even though we don't need to do this if backfilling on a different host outside of the pool. I\r\n  think breaking this use case is OK since the use case is a hack due to not having a proper\r\n  resource isolation solution (e.g. mesos should be used in this case instead).\r\n- To make things less confusing for users, there is now a \"ignore all dependencies\" option for\r\n  running tasks, \"ignore dependencies\" has been renamed to \"ignore task dependencies\", and \"force\"\r\n  has been renamed to \"ignore task instance state\". The new \"Ignore all dependencies\" flag will\r\n  ignore the following:\r\n  - task instance's pool being full\r\n  - execution date for a task instance being in the future\r\n  - a task instance being in the retry waiting period\r\n  - the task instance's task ending prior to the task instance's execution date\r\n  - task instance is already queued\r\n  - task instance has already completed\r\n  - task instance is in the shutdown state\r\n  - WILL NOT IGNORE task instance is already running\r\n- SLA miss emails will now include all tasks that did not finish for a particular DAG run, even if\r\n  the tasks didn't run because depends_on_past was not met for a task\r\n- Tasks with pools won't get queued automatically the first time they reach a worker; if\r\n  they are ready to run they will be run immediately\r\n- Running a task via the UI or via the command line (backfill/run commands) will now log why a task\r\n  could not get run if one if it's dependencies isn't met. For tasks kicked off via the web UI this\r\n  means that tasks don't silently fail to get queued despite a successful message in the UI.\r\n- Queuing a task into a pool that doesn't exist will now get stopped in the scheduler instead of a\r\n  worker\r\n\r\n**TODO**\r\n- Fix test that is failing for mysql/postgres (not sure that it is related)\r\n\r\n**Follow Up Items**\r\n- Update the docs to reference the new explainer views/CLI command\r\n\r\n**Testing Done**\r\n- New unit tests\r\n- Running in airbnb production for 2 days (will have been more by the time this is merged)\r\n- Make sure blocked deps are all shown in UI, including dagrun doesn't exist dep\r\n- Logs look good\r\n- Make sure ui throws error when ti_deps aren't met when you try to schedule a task\r\n- No delay/load issues\r\n- Test celery worker starting a task via the UI with various flags (on Bronze), and make sure the\r\n  task actually completed by checking start_date changed\r\n- Run a task that has already succeeded in the UI and make sure it's state gets changed\r\n  (including in the UI)\r\n- Make sure can backfill overtop of failed tasks\r\n- Make sure tasks still get queued when e.g. concurrency is reached or pool is reached (can test one\r\n  don't have to test both)\r\n- Make sure backfill flags still work (because they aren't passed to tasks anymore right?)\r\n  -a, --include_adhoc Include dags with the adhoc parameter.\r\n  -i, --ignore_dependencies\r\n  Skip upstream tasks, run only the tasks matching the\r\n  regexp. Only works in conjunction with task_regex\r\n  -I, --ignore_first_depends_on_past\r\n- Test airflow backfill and run commands with some flags\r\n- Tasks that should have been deadlocked are still deadlocked after this change.\r\n- Made sure that the right failing dependencies were shown on the task instance page.\r\n- Tested new CLI command by running it\r\n- Ui still works with all the various force flag combos (ignore_task_deps especially)\r\n- Backfill before a task's start date should work\r\n- Make sure that for the TI pop up dialog in tree view all buttons that are links work\r\n- Make sure logs aren't too crazy (logging a lot more e.g. in scheduler)\r\n\r\n**Future Work**\r\n- Add ignore_ti_state flag to airflow backfill command to be consistent with UI/airflow run command.\r\n- Show one more dagrun in the tree view (even when that dagrun's execution date hasn't occurred yet) so that users can see why task instances in the next dagrun are blocked. I wanted to include this in the first release but it's non-trivial to do (one way to solve this is to generate DAG runs before their execution date occurs). You can still view a non-existent task instance by passing the right query parameters to the task instance page, or by querying via the new command-line command.\r\n- Break down failed dependency explanations better (e.g. if the trigger rules requiring all upstream task successes fails, indicate the specific upstream tasks that failed)\r\n- Make failing dependencies for task instances more visible to users (e.g. asynchronously display failing dependencies when mousing over a task instance in the tree view).\r\n- Parallelize task instance dependency checking.\r\n- Don't pass around the ignore_x_deps type flags (e.g. ignore_all_deps), instead create a set of DependencyContext object at the first place the flags are initialized and pass this context down\r\n- Can add some more tips to fix a failing dependency in the new view that shows failed task instance dependencies (e.g. for \"depends_on_past\" when the last task state is failing we can give the tip to get this task to succeed, or even provide a button to clear it right from that view)\r\n- Additional task instance dependencies, e.g. DAG does not parse, there are no schedulers running (a task can't get scheduled until a

big UX improvements to the PR tool:\n\nAIRFLOW-423: commit messages are automatically wrapped at 50 characters. Paragraph breaks and tab indents are preserved. The first line of the commit is NOT forced to be 72 characters because handling this on subsequent lines is challenging. This is also deployed throughout the PR tool to make long status messages prettier.\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-423\n\nAIRFLOW-424: this commit fixes a number of whitespace and formatting issues. It’s only contribution to functionality is that the JIRA resolution process is a little clearer.\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-424\n\nAIRFLOW-426: I think this one is pretty cool. If the PR author mentions a JIRA issue anywhere in their PR (including on GitHub or buried in a commit), then the PR tool will automatically add it to the PR title. It even catches misformatted ones. So if the 20th commit mentions “AIRFLOW   - -426” somewhere in its body, you’ll still get “[AIRFLOW-426]” in the squash commit subject. \n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-426\n\nAIRFLOW-427: You can now run the PR tool from anywhere (previously you had to be `cd`'d to the Airflow git repo or set an env

a dag fails to parse and a user tries to run it e.g. via the command line airflow will give an error \"dag_id not found\" which is not clear since it sounds like the dag is completely missing rather than it just failing to parse. The message should be made clearer to address this possibility.\n\nThe longer term fix is to not display exceptions with tracebacks to users like this but catch and give an error message.\n\nPlease
