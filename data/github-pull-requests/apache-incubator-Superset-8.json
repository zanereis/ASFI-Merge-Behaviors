This re-adds that imported context with the same changes made to the query_context as made to the imported charts themselves to ensure they point at the right data source.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nMove `getRelevantDataMask` and `getAllActiveFilters` calls from Dashboard's `mapStateToProps` to a selector. \r\n\r\nOn a very large dashboard (300+ charts, 40+ filters) those calls delayed the dashboard loading time by over 3 seconds. After this change, they are negligible. Please keep in mind that you likely won't reproduce that delay on a dashboard from sample data, it only occurs on very large ones.\r\n\r\nSidenote - my key takeaway from this is that we really need to optimize our redux selectors with `createSelector` from redux toolkit more often. Plenty of our selectors have quite complex code that is mostly running unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore - you can see that there's a 3.2s load event task, which really consists of thousands of `getRelevantDataMask` calls:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a41921d1-87c9-47a8-8756-5c3f2536d74d)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/399104ac-6b32-4621-bf82-219cd34671fe)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ebbac1b-9b00-413b-8c74-f42e13d0c057)\r\n\r\nAfter

SUMMARY\r\nThe issue of the grid table being over-rendered every time the tab is changed is caused by the mapping of `orderedColumns`. To prevent this over-rendering, this commit modified the code to use `useMemo` and `React.memo`, ensuring that the same properties from the previous tab are passed to avoid unnecessary re-renders.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nlocally perf check\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes the date picker for custom start date in time comparison section so users can click the `x` to delete the date and select a new one. Currently it shows `Invalid date` and the whole date picker gets NaN values.\r\n\r\nWhen the user clicks the `x` the control panel shows the error like we do for other fields and the chart cannot be created/updated because the button is disabled.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR is related to Discussion: #30629 by Spens\r\n\r\n#### Motivation\r\nWe have adopted the tagging functionality and it is working quite well for us for dashboards and and charts. Our use case and process requires us to build dashboards on a development server, export the dashboards, commit the YAMLs to source control, and finally import the ZIPs to our production server. We would like the tags we assign on the development server to be captured in the export so they are replicated to our production server.\r\n\r\n#### Proposed Change\r\nUI elements are not affected by this change. All changes are related to updated logic/processing of the existing export and import functionality.\r\n\r\nOnly tags of type \"custom\" are exported. Other tags that exist but are not exported are \"type\" and \"owner\".\r\n\r\nExport Logic\r\nWhen an object (Dashboard/Chart) is exported, a new parameter is added to the exported YAML file. The parameter is \"tags\" and the value is an array of tag names. Here is an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nslice_name: Vaccine Candidates per Approach & Stage\r\ndescription: null\r\ntags:\r\n  - CovidTag\r\n  - Items that start with the letter V\r\n  - Superset Example Data\r\ncertified_by: null\r\n```\r\n\r\n...\r\nBecause tags have additional information (for example, a description), a new file is needed to hold this information. The file is called \"tags.yaml\" and lives in the top level of the zip file. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndashboard_export_20241017T025146.zip\r\n  charts (folder)\r\n  dashboards (folder)\r\n  databases (folder)\r\n  datasets (folder)\r\n  metadata.yaml (file)\r\n  tags.yaml (file)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe format of the tags.yaml file is an array of tags\r\n\r\n```\r\ntags:\r\n- tag_name: CovidTag\r\n  description: Everything related to Covid\r\n- tag_name: Items that start with the letter V\r\n  description: Just for fun, tag Vanilla, Vikings, and anything that starts with V\r\n- tag_name: Superset Example Data\r\n  description: Native example data included with Superset\r\n```\r\n\r\nImport Logic\r\nWhen an object is imported, the code checks to see if any tags included in the import file.\r\nIf yes, the tag is created if it does not already exist then the tag is assigned to the imported object. If the tag already exists, it is just assigned with no changes to the tag.\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\n1. A tag can only be created if the user doing the import has permission to create tags. Otherwise the tagging is ignored.\r\n2. A created tag picks up the current time as the \"created_on\" and \"changed_on\" properties for the tag\r\n3. A created tag picks up the current user as the \"created_by_fk\" and \"changed_by_fk\"\r\n4. A created tag picks up the description from the tags.yaml file described above\r\n5. If a tag already exists, the description is not updated (for consistency with other export/import behavior - for example, if you import a dashboard and the chart included in the zip already exists, Superset does not update that existing chart)\r\nExisting Superset behavior: When importing objects that already exist, the user is prompted whether it is ok to overwrite. If no, the import process aborts. If yes, the old object is replaced with the new object.\r\n\r\nTo be consistent with this behavior, when importing an object and specifying \"overwrite\", old tags that are no longer specified with the object are removed, new tags that didn't originally exist are created, old tags that still remain in the new set of tags are retained (descriptions are not updated for example)\r\n1. It is important to note that in this proposal, imported tags are not added to existing tags\r\nThis is intentional because for the use case of trying to mirror the settings and properties from one system to another, you must have the ability to remove tags from the target system. Otherwise, for example, if you rename a tag, the new name would get added and the old name would stick around which is not the desired behavior.\r\n\r\nThank you to anyone taking the time to read and comment!\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

#29877\r\n\r\nFixes #30370\r\n\r\n\r\nThe `createAxisTitleControl` and `createAxisControl` functions use the `visibility` prop to hide controls. This caused an issue where controls with duplicate names were stashed from the form data if one of them had `visibility` set to `false` and was rendered later than the visible one.\r\n\r\n#### Solution\r\nTo resolve this, I introduced a new prop `disableStash`, to the `Control` component, which prevents stashing for the control where it is applied.\r\nAdditionally, I set the `resetOnHide` prop to `false` to prevent the axis titles from disappearing on the chart when changing the orientation.\r\n\r\n#### Hidden prop bug\r\nInitially, I considered replacing `visibility` with a `hidden` prop in the Bar chart controls. However, this approach led to issues with refreshing hidden control values and I decided to keep the `visibility` prop for a less invasive change.\r\nWhile working with the `hidden` prop, I discovered a bug where `{...restProps}` overwrote the `hidden` prop's intended value, so `() => false` value was hiding the control. I plan to address this in a separate issue. The first commit reflects this initial approach, but I reverted it in the following commit to keep this PR focused on the `visibility` prop and `disableStash` solution.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79d349fd-d86d-4320-be88-9b74e3ce7e76\r\n\r\n#### After\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51013344-3e61-474a-9795-312c8f5f51fa\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThe main ECharts series chart tooltips aren't sorting correctly. This is due to the tooltip keys being populated from `Object.keys` from an object that was originally an array, which of course doesn't have a guaranteed sort order. This issue appears to have been there for a very long time: I treid to hunt it down with Blame, and I stopped searching when I got to three years ago where the code had already changed considerably, but the same bug seemed to be there.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the bug, DRYs the code as the same logic is also needed in Mixed Timeseries chart, and adds simple tests for the new util. Naturally a full `transformProps` integration test would be preferable here, but it felt like too much added code for such a small fix. Also, the util test looks concise enough for people to understand what it's used for.\r\n\r\nP.S. In the screenshots below please excuse my awful theme colors (I have those in my devenv to remind myself of the importance of theming work)\r\n\r\nP.P.S. I suggest reviewing with hidden whitespace changes, as the changes are mostly that.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNotice how \"Tooltip sort by metric\" is working as expected (biggest metric values are on the bottom due to stacking):\r\n<img width=\"856\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/777edb2c-a43c-467d-8914-723397a5a1f5\">\r\n\r\nAlso sorting series by \"Category name\" works as expected (this can be seen comparing the tooltip colors vs the bars):\r\n<img width=\"855\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/092f2f3c-8da6-4a99-a5d7-e66d0b84a420\">\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nCurrently \"Tooltip sort by metric\" doesn't do anything (metric values are not monotonically growing):\r\n<img width=\"858\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58979041-2a55-4755-86ef-ade3aed12ea3\">\r\nWhen not sorting by metric, the series sort order isn't reflected in the tooltip order (the order is not the same in tooltip as on the bars):\r\n<img width=\"863\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6787f9d-41b7-4563-bdc4-b6fbdda668c4\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a bar/line chart with a dimension to sort by\r\n2. Try changing the series sort order to see if it's reflected in the tooltip\r\n3. Try toggling \"Tooltip sort by metric\" control\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

#30669 \r\nchore(accessibility): improve form control for 'Show x entries' in table charts\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses an accessibility issue in the table charts component of Apache Superset. The 'Show x entries' dropdown lacked proper form control labeling, which is essential for screen reader users. The label has been updated to ensure that it provides a clear and descriptive indication of its purpose, improving the overall accessibility of the feature. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n![Per page superset](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c02d7d35-c6e4-412d-8c07-187a75398e3a)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Navigate to a table chart in Apache Superset.\r\n2. Locate the 'Show x entries' dropdown.\r\n3. Use a screen reader (e.g., NVDA or VoiceOver) to navigate to the dropdown.\r\n4. Verify that the screen reader announces the label correctly as \"Show [number] entries,\" where [number] is the selected value.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: Fixes #30669\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ]

href=\"https://redirect.github.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/762\">#762</a> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/763\">#763</a>)</li>\n<li>update node support matrix (only support node 16-20) (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/750\">#750</a>)</li>\n<li>This library always aims at supporting one EOLed LTS release which by this time now is 12.x which has reached EOL 30 Apr 2022.</li>\n<li>Remove the minified UMD build from the package.</li>\n<li>Drop support for browsers that don't correctly implement const/let and default arguments, and no longer transpile the browser build to ES2015.</li>\n<li>Although in practice this is currently a noop since the resulting build does not change, the build will no longer transpiles future changes for Node.js 8.x targets, so semantically this is still a breaking change.</li>\n<li>Deep requiring specific algorithms of this library like require('uuid/v4'), which has been deprecated in uuid@7, is no longer supported.</li>\n<li>The default export, which used to be the v4() method but which was already discouraged in v3.x of this library, has been removed.</li>\n<li>Explicitly note that deep imports of the different uuid version functions are deprecated and no longer encouraged and that ECMAScript module named imports should be used instead. Emit a deprecation warning for people who deep-require the different algorithm variants.</li>\n<li>Remove builtin support for insecure random number generators in the browser. Users who want that will have to supply their own random number generator function.</li>\n<li>Remove support for generating v3 and v5 UUIDs in Node.js&lt;4.x</li>\n<li>Convert code base to ECMAScript Modules (ESM) and release CommonJS build for node and ESM build for browser bundlers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>add parse/stringify/validate/version/NIL APIs (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/479\">#479</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/0e6c10ba1bf9517796ff23c052fc0468eedfd5f4\">0e6c10b</a>)</li>\n<li>add support for MAX uuid (new in RFC9562) (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/714\">#714</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/0385cd3f18ae9920678b2849932fa7a9d9aee7d0\">0385cd3</a>)</li>\n<li>add UMD build to npm package (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/357\">#357</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/4e75adf435196f28e3fbbe0185d654b5ded7ca2c\">4e75adf</a>)</li>\n<li>add various es module and CommonJS examples (<a href=\"https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/b238510bf352463521f74bab175a3af9b7a42555\">b238510</a>)</li>\n<li>enforce Conventional Commit style commit messages (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/282\">#282</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/0705cd5bae3ab07415294e5544901ffcf0ad4e23\">0705cd5</a>)</li>\n<li>ensure that docs are up-to-date in CI (<a href=\"https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/ee5e77db547474f5a8f23d6c857a6d399209986b\">ee5e77d</a>)</li>\n<li>hybrid CommonJS &amp; ECMAScript modules build (<a href=\"https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/a3f078faa0baff69ab41aed08e041f8f9c8993d0\">a3f078f</a>)</li>\n<li>improve performance of v1 string representation (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/453\">#453</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/0ee0b67c37846529c66089880414d29f3ae132d5\">0ee0b67</a>)</li>\n<li>improve v4 performance by reusing random number array (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/435\">#435</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/bf4af0d711b4d2ed03d1f74fd12ad0baa87dc79d\">bf4af0d</a>)</li>\n<li>optimize uuid.v1 by 1.3x uuid.v4 by 4.3x (430%) (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/597\">#597</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/commit/3a033f6bab6bb3780ece6d645b902548043280bc\">3a033f6</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nPR https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/29187 introduced a new endpoint for generating dashboard screenshots and PR https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/29272 made this endpoint mandatory for the frontend. However, Celery should be an optional dependency in Superset and the endpoint is dependent on Celery to work. This PR makes **Celery optional** for generating dashboard screenshots by:\r\n\r\n- **Reintroducing the previous download screenshot functionality**:  \r\n  This update enables dashboards to be downloaded directly from the browser, without using the dedicated API endpoint. This approach has known CORS limitations but will work for most cases where Celery isn't configured.\r\n\r\n- **Adding two new feature flags**:\r\n  - **`ENABLE_DASHBOARD_SCREENSHOT_ENDPOINTS`**:  \r\n    Controls whether the API endpoint that caches and retrieves dashboard screenshots via a webdriver is enabled, allowing this functionality to be decoupled from the UI. This flag is set to `False` by default.\r\n  \r\n  - **`ENABLE_DASHBOARD_DOWNLOAD_WEBDRIVER_SCREENSHOT`**:  \r\n    Controls whether the UI’s download functionality uses webdriver-based screenshot generation. This flag is also `False` by default and it is dependent on `ENABLE_DASHBOARD_SCREENSHOT_ENDPOINTS`.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/30645\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Enter a Dashboard\r\n2. Download a PDF or Image screenshot via the Dashboard menu\r\n3. The screenshot should download normally \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR adds static resource configuration to the Nginx setup in the Docker directory. The changes include specifying a static directory in nginx.conf to serve frontend assets with caching enabled. This update helps improve resource loading times and serves assets directly from the designated directory, making the Nginx configuration more aligned with application needs.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nTo manually verify these changes:\r\n\r\n\t1.\tStop the current docker-compose service.\r\n\t2.\tModify the nginx.conf file as specified:\r\n\t•\tAdd a /static alias pointing to the frontend source directory with caching enabled.\r\n\t3.\tRestart docker-compose:\r\n\t•\tdocker compose up\r\n        4. Check that static resources are served correctly under /static.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are
