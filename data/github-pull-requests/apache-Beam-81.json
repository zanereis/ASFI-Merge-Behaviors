There have been many improvements,\nhighlights are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Annotations of the main namespace are essentially complete. Upstream\nis a moving target, so there will likely be further improvements,\nbut the major work is done. This is probably the most user visible\nenhancement in this release.</li>\n<li>A preliminary version of the proposed Array-API is provided. This is\na step in creating a standard collection of functions that can be\nused across application such as CuPy and JAX.</li>\n<li>NumPy now has a DLPack backend. DLPack provides a common interchange\nformat for array (tensor) data.</li>\n<li>New methods for <code>quantile</code>, <code>percentile</code>, and related functions. The\nnew methods provide a complete set of the methods commonly found in\nthe literature.</li>\n<li>A new configurable allocator for use by downstream projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are in addition to the ongoing work to provide SIMD support for\ncommonly used functions, improvements to F2PY, and better documentation.</p>\n<p>The Python versions supported in this release are 3.8-3.10, Python 3.7\nhas been dropped. Note that 32 bit wheels are only provided for Python\n3.8 and 3.9 on Windows, all other wheels are 64 bits on account of\nUbuntu, Fedora, and other Linux distributions dropping 32 bit support.\nAll 64 bit wheels are also linked with 64 bit integer OpenBLAS, which should fix\nthe occasional problems encountered by folks using truly huge arrays.</p>\n<h2>Expired deprecations</h2>\n<h3>Deprecated numeric style dtype strings have been removed</h3>\n<p>Using the strings <code>&quot;Bytes0&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Datetime64&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Str0&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Uint32&quot;</code>,\nand <code>&quot;Uint64&quot;</code> as a dtype will now raise a <code>TypeError</code>.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19539\">gh-19539</a>)</p>\n<h3>Expired deprecations for <code>loads</code>, <code>ndfromtxt</code>, and <code>mafromtxt</code> in npyio</h3>\n<p><code>numpy.loads</code> was deprecated in v1.15, with the recommendation that\nusers use <code>pickle.loads</code> instead. <code>ndfromtxt</code> and <code>mafromtxt</code> were both\ndeprecated in v1.17 - users should use <code>numpy.genfromtxt</code> instead with\nthe appropriate value for the <code>usemask</code> parameter.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19615\">gh-19615</a>)</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

(11/23/2022): the final implementation was merged - https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/23413\r\n\r\nThis is a prototype implementation of https://s.apache.org/easy-multi-language\r\n\r\nThis adds:\r\n* Support for dynamically discovering and registering SchemaTransforms in the Java expansion service.\r\n* Support for dynamically discovering registered SchemaTransforms from the Python side.\r\n* Support for using SchemaTransforms in Python pipelines.\r\n\r\nEnd-to-end tested this by running a pipeline that writes to Kafka using a SchemaTransform-based Kafka Write implementation. Also updated kafka.py to dynamically discover the identifier of the Kafka Write transform using the new transform discovery API.\r\n\r\n\r\nWIP (do not merge)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

NOT MERGE`\r\n\r\nAs part of the issue [21106](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/21106), @elink21 and I have implemented the self-hosted runners for the Ubuntu and Windows operating systems. \r\n\r\nIn this PR you will find the following changes: \r\n\r\n* Updates in workflows to `runs-on` self-hosted runners (Ubuntu and Windows)\r\n* Docker and Kubernetes files to reproduce the environment of the Ubuntu runners in local and in Google Kubernetes Engine\r\n* Scripts for the Windows runners implementation on GCP Compute Engine (VMs)\r\n* Cloud Function scripts\r\n* Detailed documentation in README files \r\n\r\nNote: We will rely on GitHub-hosted runners for MacOS builds until a straightforward implementation approach comes out.\r\n\r\n[PR#16511

Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The options <code>skip-stale-issue-message</code> and <code>skip-stale-pr-message</code> were removed. Instead, setting the options <code>stale-issue-message</code> and <code>stale-pr-message</code> will be enough to let the stale workflow add a comment. If the options are unset, a comment will not be added which was the equivalent of setting <code>skip-stale-issue-message</code> to <code>true</code>.</li>\n<li>The <code>operations-per-run</code> option will be more effective. After migrating, you could face a failed-fast process workflow if you let the default value (30) or set it to a small number.

Instead, setting the options <code>stale-issue-message</code> and <code>stale-pr-message</code> will be enough to let the stale workflow add a comment. If the options are unset, a comment will not be added which was the equivalent of setting <code>skip-stale-issue-message</code> to <code>true</code>.</li>\n<li>The <code>operations-per-run</code> option will be more effective. After migrating, you could face a failed-fast process workflow if you let the default value (30) or set it to a small number. In that case, you will see a warning at the end of the logs (if enabled) indicating that the workflow was stopped sooner to avoid consuming too much API calls.

href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-node/releases\">actions/setup-node's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Add support for asdf format and update actions/cache version to 3.0.0</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we updated <code>actions/cache</code> package as the new version contains fixes for <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/526\">caching error handling</a>. Moreover, we added support for asdf format as Node.js version file <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/373\">actions/setup-node#373</a>. Besides, we introduced new output <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/534\">node-version</a> and added <code>npm-shrinkwrap.json</code> to dependency file patterns: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/439\">actions/setup-node#439</a></p>\n<h2>Update actions/cache version to 2.0.2</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we updated <code>actions/cache</code> package as the new version contains fixes related to GHES 3.5 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/460\">actions/setup-node#460</a>)</p>\n<h2>v3.0.0</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we changed version of the runtime Node.js for the setup-node action and updated package-lock.json file to  v2.</p>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>With the update to Node 16 in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/414\">actions/setup-node#414</a>, all scripts will now be run with Node 16 rather than Node 12.</li>\n<li>We removed deprecated <code>version</code> input (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/424\">actions/setup-node#424</a>). Please use <code>node-version</code> input instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fix logic of error handling for npm warning and uncaught exception</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we fix logic of error handling related to caching (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/358\">actions/setup-node#358</a>) and (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/pull/359\">actions/setup-node#359</a>).</p>\n<p>In the previous behaviour we relied on <code>stderr</code> output to throw error. The warning messages from package managers can be written to the stderr's output. For now the action will throw an error only if exit code differs from zero. Besides, we add logic to сatch and log unhandled exceptions.</p>\n<h2>Adding Node.js version file support</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we add the <code>node-version-file</code> input and update <code>actions/cache</code> dependency to the latest version.</p>\n<h2>Adding Node.js version file support</h2>\n<p>The new input (<code>node-version-file</code>) provides functionality to specify the path to the file containing Node.js's version with such behaviour:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the file does not exist the action will throw an error.</li>\n<li>If you specify both <code>node-version</code> and <code>node-version-file</code> inputs, the action will use value from the <code>node-version</code> input and throw the following warning: <code>Both node-version and node-version-file inputs are specified, only node-version will be used</code>.</li>\n<li>For now the action does not support all of the variety of values for Node.js version files. The action can handle values according to the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-node#supported-version-syntax\">documentation</a> and values with <code>v</code> prefix (<code>v14</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>steps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n  - name: Setup node from node version file\n    uses: actions/setup-node@v2\n    with:\n      node-version-file: '.nvmrc'\n  - run: npm install\n  - run: npm test\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Update actions/cache dependency to 1.0.8 version.</h2>\n<p>We updated actions/cache dependency to the latest version (1.0.8). For more information please refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/packages/cache/RELEASES.md\">toolkit/cache</a>.</p>\n<h2>Add &quot;cache-hit&quot; output</h2>\n<p>This release introduces a new output: <code>cache-hit</code> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/issues/327\">#327</a>).</p>\n<p>The <code>cache-hit</code> output contains boolean value indicating that an exact match was found for the key. It shows that the action uses already existing cache or not. The output is available only if cache is enabled.</p>\n<h2>Support caching for mono repos and repositories with complex structure</h2>\n<p>This release introduces dependency caching support for mono repos and repositories with complex structure (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-node/issues/305\">#305</a>).</p>\n<p>By default, the action searches for the dependency file (<code>package-lock.json</code> or <code>yarn.lock</code>) in the repository root. Use the <code>cache-dependency-path</code> input for cases when multiple dependency files are used, or they are located in different subdirectories. This input supports wildcards or a list of file names for caching multiple dependencies.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-go/releases\">actions/setup-go's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Update actions/cache version to 3.0.0</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we updated <code>actions/cache</code> package as the new version contains fixes for <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-go/pull/238\">caching error handling</a></p>\n<h2>v3.0.0</h2>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default runtime to node16 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-go/pull/192\">actions/setup-go#192</a>)</li>\n<li>Update <code>package-lock.json</code> file version to 2 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-go/pull/193\">actions/setup-go#193</a>) and <code>@types/node</code> to 16.11.25 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-go/pull/194\">actions/setup-go#194</a>)</li>\n<li>Remove the <code>stable</code> input and fix SemVer notation (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-go/pull/195\">actions/setup-go#195</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<p>With the update to Node 16, all scripts will now be run with Node 16 rather than Node 12.</p>\n<p>This new major release removes the <code>stable</code> input, so there is no need to specify additional input to use pre-release versions. This release also corrects the pre-release versions syntax to satisfy the SemVer notation (1.18.0-beta1 -&gt; 1.18.0-beta.1, 1.18.0-rc1 -&gt; 1.18.0-rc.1).</p>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>steps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n  - uses: actions/setup-go@v3\n    with:\n      go-version: '1.18.0-rc.1' \n  - run: go version\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Add check-latest input</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we add the <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-go/pull/186\">check-latest</a> input. If <code>check-latest</code> is set to <code>true</code>, the action first checks if the cached version is the latest one. If the locally cached version is not the most up-to-date, a Go version will then be downloaded from <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/go-versions\">go-versions</a> repository. By default <code>check-latest</code> is set to <code>false</code>.\nExample of usage:</p>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>steps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n  - uses: actions/setup-go@v2\n    with:\n      go-version: '1.16'\n      check-latest: true\n  - run: go version\n</code></pre>\n<p>Moreover, we updated <code>@actions/core</code> from <code>1.2.6</code> to <code>1.6.0</code></p>\n<h2>v2.1.5</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we updated <code>matchers.json</code>  to improve the problem matcher pattern. For more information please refer to this <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-go/pull/98\">pull request</a></p>\n<h2>v2.1.4</h2>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix extractor selection on windows by <a href=\"https://github.com/paulcacheux\"><code>@​paulcacheux</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-go/pull/141\">actions/setup-go#141</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>New Contributors</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/paulcacheux\"><code>@​paulcacheux</code></a> made their first contribution in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/setup-go/pull/141\">actions/setup-go#141</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-go/compare/v2.1.3...v2.1.4\">https://github.com/actions/setup-go/compare/v2.1.3...v2.1.4</a></p>\n<h2>v2.1.3</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated communication with runner to use environment files rather then workflow commands</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
