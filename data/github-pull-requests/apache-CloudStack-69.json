@DaanHoogland and @bhaisaab \n\nI have fixed the packaging under the test directory.\n\nAll the tests classes had the package declaration pointing to a location that did not exist. For Maven it was fine, because it used a --sourcepath during build. However, when using an IDE it was complaining. Despite the IDE fact, it's not nice to have differences between source directory and package declaration.\n\nIn addition, I also renamed the package from \"com.cloud.hypervisor.xenserver.resource.wrapper.citrix\" to \"com.cloud.hypervisor.xenserver.resource.wrapper.xenbase\" \n\nUsual tests have been executed with the following

for the ability to disable a storage pool for provisioning of new volumes. Following changes are implemented\n1. Disable or enable a pool with the updateStoragePool api. A new 'enabled' parameter added for the same.\n2. When a pool is disabled the state of the pool is updated to 'Disabled' in the db. On enabling it is updated back to 'Up'. Alert is raised when a pool is disabled or enabled.\n3. Updated other storage providers to also honor the disabled state.\n4. A disabled pool is skipped by allocators for provisioning of new volumes.\n5. Since the allocators skip a disabled pool for provisioning of volumes, the volumes are also not listed as a destination for volume migration.\n6.

guys,\n\nThis PR has the following goodies:\n- Tomcat built by maven project (currently set to 8.0.22);\n- Java 8 support on tomcat :)\n- Fixed sluggish page reload times for client webapp;\n- Fixed some issues and merged differences in the tomcat startup scripts in centos 6 and 7\n- Fixed issue with cloudstack-setup-management script in centos 7\n- Fixed duplication of static files in management rpm\n- Synced sudoers config and fixed error running keytool in ubuntu \n\nSome advantages of packing tomcat (while not getting rid of it completely ;) ):\n- Control the tomcat version that is actually run across all users by just setting the version on the tomcat module's pom.xml\n- Remove dependencies on different packages for tomcat in different distros (a change in the OS provided package will break setup, like what just happened with CentOS 7.0 vs 7.1).\n- Remove necessity of maintaining different configuration files for distros running different versions of tomcat\n- Extend out of the box functionality for more distros :)\n","created_at":"2015-05-08T00:36:33Z","updated_at":"2015-06-08T21:37:04Z","closed_at":"2015-06-08T21:37:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f79d033fe5afa4087df163174038b9fb2d53c67b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/238/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/238/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/238/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/ca62977633d9238ae7fec65161962731a95b2fe4","head":{"label":"rsafonseca:fixpackaging","ref":"fixpackaging","sha":"ca62977633d9238ae7fec65161962731a95b2fe4","user":{"login":"rsafonseca","id":12141667,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQxNjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12141667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca","html_url":"https://github.com/rsafonseca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34946700,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk0NjcwMA==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"rsafonseca/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rsafonseca","id":12141667,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQxNjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12141667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca","html_url":"https://github.com/rsafonseca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rsafonseca/cloudstack","description":"Mirror
