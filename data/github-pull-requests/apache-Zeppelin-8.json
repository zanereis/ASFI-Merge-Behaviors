What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nI wanted to generate the `docs` site on my Mac, and found a bunch of old dependencies that needed updating.

What is this PR for?\r\nZeppelin uses GitHub Action to complete Continuous integration (CI). Specifically, it has three workflows: `core.yaml`, `frontend.yaml` and `rat.yaml`. However, It is currently not possible to verify the functions of zeppelin in the k8s environment in these workflows.\r\n\r\nThis PR utilizes **Minikube** as the k8s environment for CI testing. Specifically, it defines a new GitHub Action workflow: `k8s_ci_tests.yaml`.

What is this PR for?\r\nCurrently, users can build a smaller docker image of zeppelin interpreter by modifying the Dockerfile in `scripts/docker/zeppelin-interpreter`. But I think a more ideal way is that user can use a shell script to build the docker image (something like `docker-image-tool.sh` in Apache Spark) and specify the interpreters they want.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n```\r\nUsage: ./Dockerfile_gen.sh [options] [command]\r\nThis script outputs a Dockerfile for building the zeppelin image that contains some specific interpreters.\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n  -i interpreter        (Optional) A comma-separated list of interpreter directory names (under /path/to/zeppelin/interpreter/)\r\n                        that need to be add into the docker image.\r\n                        By default, it will add the spark interpreter.\r\n  -c conda yaml file    (Optional) Specify the conda yaml file that manages python and R packages. By default, it will not install\r\n                        python and R packages through conda.\r\n  -v zeppelin version   (Optional) Specify the version of zeppelin. By default, the version is \"0.9.0\".\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n  - Output the Dockerfile for building the zeppelin image that contains spark and python interpreter.\r\n    ./Dockerfile_gen.sh -i spark,python\r\n\r\n  - Output the Dockerfile for building the zeppelin image that contains spark and python interpreter and specify the\r\n    conda yaml file \"python3.yaml\"\r\n    ./Dockerfile_gen.sh -i spark,python -c python3.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample generated Dockerfile:\r\n```\r\n# Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\r\n# contributor license agreements.

What is this PR for?\r\nCurrently, when zeppelin server is running outside of k8s cluster, users cannot access the spark UI directly from the web page of Zeppelin. So this PR creates ingress resource in `k8s/interpreter/100-interpreter-spec.yaml` and enables the `SPARK JOB` button to jump directly to the URL defined by ingress.\r\n\r\nIf user does not specify the property `zeppelin.spark.uiWebUrl`, it will be automatically generated according to the template: `{{PORT}}-{{SERVICE_NAME}}.{{SERVICE_DOMAIN}}`, which is also the URL that the `SPARK JOB` button points to. So this PR also configured the ingress.host by this URL.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a property `zeppelin.k8s.spark.useIngress` to let user choose whether to create ingress. \r\nExample usage:\r\n```\r\nzeppelin.k8s.spark.useIngress true\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5445>\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* CI pass and manually tested\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\nCurrently, if zeppelin is running under k8s mode and the zeppelin server is running inside the k8s cluster, it will start the interpreter pod under the namespace specified in `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/namespace`. But if zeppelin-server is running **outside of kubernetes cluster**, it will use the config `zeppelin.k8s.namespace` to start the interpreter pod under the given namespace. However, this approach will cause users to only set a **global namespace**.\r\n\r\nHence, this PR allows user to set a set **separate namespace** for the interpreter in the interpreter settings:\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n```\r\n%spark.conf\r\nzeppelin.k8s.interpreter.namespace spark\r\n```\r\nThe spark interpreter pod will be created under the namespace: `spark`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n%python.conf\r\nzeppelin.k8s.interpreter.namespace python\r\n```\r\nThe python interpreter pod will be created under the namespace: `python`.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5442>\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* CI pass and manually tested\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\nCurrently, users cannot set the service account for the interpreter pod under k8s mode. And there is no service account defined in the pod `spec` in `k8s/interpreter/100-interpreter-spec.yaml`. According to the documentation of Kubernetes (<https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/>):\r\n> When you create a pod, if you do not specify a service account, it is automatically assigned the **default** service account in the same namespace.\r\n\r\n, which means that currently the interpreter pod can only use the default service account.\r\n\r\nIn order to allow users to directly set the service account for the interpreter pod in the interpreter settings, this PR adds a k8s template property, named `zeppelin.k8s.interpreter.serviceAccount`.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n```\r\n%spark.conf\r\nzeppelin.k8s.interpreter.serviceAccount yourServiceAccount\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the `k8s/interpreter/100-interpreter-spec.yaml` creates a **role binding** when using the spark interpreter. It was originally directly bound to the default service account. This PR makes it bind to the service account set by user.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5444>\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* CI pass and manually tested\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\nCurrently, the interpreter pod created by `k8s/interpreter/100-interpreter-spec.yaml` cannot set the `imagePullPolicy` for both the zeppelin image and the spark image (When using the spark interpreter, the spark image needs to be set for the init container).\r\n\r\nSo this PR adds two properties:\r\n* `zeppelin.k8s.interpreter.container.imagePullPolicy`, to set the pull policy of the zeppelin image.\r\n* `zeppelin.k8s.spark.container.imagePullPolicy`, to set the pull policy of the spark image.\r\n\r\nUsers can set these two properties directly in the interpreter settings, such as:\r\n```\r\n%spark.conf\r\nzeppelin.k8s.interpreter.container.imagePullPolicy Always\r\nzeppelin.k8s.spark.container.imagePullPolicy Always\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5456>\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* CI pass and manually tested\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-12T06:49:03Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T05:30:45Z","closed_at":"2021-07-21T05:30:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2499c6e807e71e41abc12a483a9ef668bb5838ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4171/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4171/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4171/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/07678f33fb0b6dcb7689ea989e8427ec765c707a","head":{"label":"rickchengx:ZEPPELIN-5456","ref":"ZEPPELIN-5456","sha":"07678f33fb0b6dcb7689ea989e8427ec765c707a","user":{"login":"rickchengx","id":38122586,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTIyNTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38122586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx","html_url":"https://github.com/rickchengx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":383684661,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODM2ODQ2NjE=","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"rickchengx/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rickchengx","id":38122586,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTIyNTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38122586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx","html_url":"https://github.com/rickchengx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rickchengx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rickchengx/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

What is this PR for?\r\nWhen Zeppelin is creating the interpreter pod, it may need to pull the image from the **private repository**. However, the current `k8s/interpreter/100-interpreter-spec.yaml` file does not support setting the config `imagePullSecrets`. \r\n\r\nSo this PR adds a property named: `zeppelin.k8s.interpreter.imagePullSecrets`, which allows users to set the **comma-separated list of Kubernetes secrets**. So that the interpreter pod can pull the image from the private repository.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\n%spark.conf\r\nzeppelin.k8s.interpreter.imagePullSecrets mysecret1,mysecret2,mysecret3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5360>\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* CI pass and manually tested\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThis is to support scala 2.12 of flink interpreter. Here's the main changes:\r\n\r\n1. Copy `FlinkILoop`, `FlinkShell`, `ScalaShellEnvironment`, `ScalaShellStreamEnvironment` & `JarHelper` from flink project. The reason is that currently flink scala shell only support scala 2.11, we need to copy it here and do some hack work to support scala 2.12\r\n2. Introduce 2 modules: `flink-scala-2.11`  & `flink-scala-2.12` , each of them will build one interpreter jar, and FlinkInterpreterLauncher will choose the right interpreter jar based on the current scala version of flink.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[ Feature ]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5339\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* CI pass\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

fix  InterpreterSettingManager init error  then init again \r\n### What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThis problem is because\r\n   The loadFromFile() method of the InterpreterSettingManager class during initialization\r\n    (This method is mainly to load all interpreters and dependency processing) It is found that newly added  interpreter is configured with dependent jar packages ,The InterpreterSetting class will start the thread to do interpreter dependency processing, and then trigger the` interpreterSettingManager.saveToFile()` operation. Save the interpreter.json file. This operation is time-consuming. At the same time, the main thread then executes saveToFile();  this time there is a thread synchronization problem\r\n      There is a high probability that the main thread exception  and after this
