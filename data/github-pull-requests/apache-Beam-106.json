if an input bundle of elements had 5000 elements and batch size was 500, GroupIntoBatches would emit 10 times and the flushes would be performed sequentially.  Since the underlying BQ insertAll now parallelizes rpcs when limits are exceeded, we unbatch and reuse the dofn used for viafinalization.  GroupIntoBatches is still beneficial to only flush once there is enough elements for a batch or timeout.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is a fix for IllegalArgumentException that happens during reading of a numeric column. The issue is following: say you have a numeric field with precision 15 and scale 2. When JdbcIO reads values they might have smaller precision, say 6. I loosen the check so if the precision and the scale are less or equal than defined for a column we allow it.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is a fix for IllegalArgumentException that happens during reading of a numeric column. The issue is following: say you have a numeric field with precision 15 and scale 2. When JdbcIO reads values they might have smaller precision, say 6. I loosen the check so if the precision and the scale are less or equal than defined for a column we allow it.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR is porting BEAM-12225 (https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/14743) (AWS SDK v1) to the SDK v2.\r\n\r\nBeam currently uses AWS DescribeStream API to list Kinesis shards. There are few problems with it:\r\n\r\n- it is deprecated as per AWS documentation\r\n- it is slow, as it requires additional validation of listed shards (it returns all of them, including closed ones, so GetShardIterator calls are required)\r\n- it has low transaction limit per second (per account)\r\n- AWS changed the behaviour of GetShardIterator (it returns iterator for closed shards) and because of that Beam might read too old data, leading to increase in costs and delay\r\n\r\nUse of ListShards API eliminates problems mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

was [noted](https://lists.apache.org/thread/mrrq04nhkfm5j60y4t92bhnjk15t3dts) that the GoSDK examples (which aren't automatically run at the moment) were breaking due to not having their types and funcs registered, which became more of a requirement at some point in the past.\r\n\r\nThis PR registers all types and funcs used in the pipeline w/beam so that they can get looked up by workers easily.\r\n\r\nTested manually on Flink 1.13 and Spark 3 in loopback mode. All examples now run successfullly.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is already the support for startReadTime using SDF when the Kafka version is supported.\r\nI want to add the support for stopReadTIme so we can extract messages from Kafka only up to a point in time and then the task will be finished.\r\nOne use case: when you want to only re-process (re-read) a period of time for a Kafka topic in your pipeline.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n - [x]

tinkered around with the built-in Boto3-based S3 integration in the Python SDK, since it turned out to be rather inefficient, which comes mostly from the fact that it creates a new range request for each chunk (inefficient even with `Connection: Keep-Alive`) and also relies on huge 16MB buffers (which isn't always optimal for latency in general or client apps which do their own buffering).\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the Boto3 client to keep track of a previously opened HTTP stream instead of creating a new connection/range request for each read.\r\n\r\nThis implementation is more cache efficient also for the server, since it allocates only one long-lived stream for the whole S3 object instead of requesting a new range with each read.\r\n\r\nHere are a few benchmarks for reading a WARC file from our Ceph cluster and iterating all records with FastWARC. For comparison I chose the default buffer size (16MB) and a much smaller one (65536 bytes, FastWARC's default internal buffer size).\r\n\r\n    old:\r\n      5518.28 records/s (large buffer)\r\n       760.86 records/s (small buffer)\r\n\r\n    new:\r\n      6156.54 records/s (large buffer)\r\n      9292.72 records/s (small buffer)\r\n\r\nWith a small buffer, it's about 1.7x faster, with the large buffer it's still a bit faster, but not much, because the overhead of allocating and discarding large byte strings starts kicking in. Old version with a small buffer is slower by more than 12x.\r\n\r\nThe new S3 client also has a new optional constructor parameter for setting an initial offset. I don't know how else to expose this functionality, but it's way more efficient than opening a stream from the start and then seeking to the desired position. This is meant mainly for use cases where you implement your own `FileBasedSource`. Unfortunately, `FileBasedSource.open_file()` provides no interface for opening a file at a certain initial offset, but you can work around it by constructing your own `Client` and `S3IO` instances for `s3://` URLs.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: There is no issue report for this, so I can't put it in the title and I also don't know whom to ping for review.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is almost 2000 lines long. This change breaks up the file into logical groupings:\r\n* FhirIOSearch -> Move FhirIO.Search into this, and move the FhirSearchParameters in\r\n* FhirIORead -> Move FhirIO.Read here\r\n* FhirIOWrite -> Move FhirIO.Write, FhirIO.Import and FhirIO.ExecuteBundles into here. Additionally make ExecuteBundles implement FhirIOWrite, cleaning up some excess code.\r\n\r\nAlso renamed all occurrences of FHIR messages -> FHIR resources & fixed some incorrect references to Hl7v2 in comments. Messages are an Hl7v2 concept, and are different from resources. (In Hl7v2, messages are stateless. FHIR resources are stateful).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Log the operation status + increment counters, not just # of success/failures.\r\n- Polling every 500ms is excessive, 15 seconds should be enough for expected time for an operation to complete.\r\n- Remove unsupported content structure for FHIR imports:\r\nFhirIO.Import specifically formats input JSON into NDJSON (even for pretty input) and then writes multiple resources to a single file. Therefore, only RESOURCE or BUNDLE content type can be specified. There is no functionality lost here, as pretty JSON can still be passed as input and will be transformed before the import operation begins.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

 Add Neo4jIO (initial code drop)\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds a basic but fully functional IO connector for graph database Neo4j. \r\nI'd be happy to continue as a project contributor to maintain this code in the future.  I already signed an Apache ICLA (mcasters@apache.org) for my work on Apache Hop.  This work is also sponsored by and donated by Neo4j.\r\n\r\nSince it's not possible to run the Neo4j graph database embedded on Java8 (11 is required) I used the test class to test the driver configuration code and the integration test class to test against a Neo4j docker container that is spun up for this purpose.  A Direct runner is used there.\r\n\r\nI have no idea who would be the ideal reviewer for this PR but I'll send a mail to dev to ask for volunteers.\r\n\r\nAdditional testing was done outside of this contribution on GCP Dataflow but I unfortunately have no idea how I can integrate this with the Apache Beam codebase.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

The problem \r\n\r\nWhen calling to\r\n```\r\ncollection.apply(SqlTransform.query(query))\r\n```\r\nThere are cases that a query can have some errors for a small amount of events in the collection, for example UDF can produce runtime error when it gets some invalid input data.\r\nCurrent behaviour is that query is failed and records are retried forever, and huge pipeline can have backlog just because 1-2 invalid events.\r\nWe need an option to send failed rows to some DLQ and continue processing the rest of the data.\r\n\r\n### The solution:\r\n\r\nAdded an option to send transformer that get the failed rows with their error and can handler them, sending to PubSub  DLQ, failed error table, logs etc..\r\n\r\n```\r\n        input.apply(SqlTransform.query(query)\r\n                .withErrorsTransformer(new  BeamSqlErrorTransformer())\r\n                .registerUdf(\"func1\", Func1.class)\r\n                .registerUdf(\"func2\",
