am working with image data that does not fit well into uint8.  Given that I am working with 100k-1M images, I need a data iterator that is fast, such as the ImageIter.  I have been looking into extending the ImageIter to use other types besides uint8 for reading data.  It appears that after the initial read, there is no problem with container type.\r\nI've tried writing a new iter in python (using python reads), and they are still slow.\r\n\r\nSo I've turned my attention to extending mxnet's imdecode function to work with uint16 in addition to uint8. This PR is a sketch, if there is interest I will continue.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of issues remaining, just as [mshadow has no uint16 type](https://github.com/dmlc/mshadow/blob/a9d70f06b791f42277ccd76a50d571495de9ca66/mshadow/base.h#L264-L270) (to replace `mshadow::kUint8`).\r\n\r\nI am open to comments on my approach. An alternative would be to allow I/O from CV mat files, which can store any format.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-05T18:05:18Z","updated_at":"2017-03-09T18:17:12Z","closed_at":"2017-03-09T18:17:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e99c8615bb07ad7efcb3f10059491ae231d1c778","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/5261/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/5261/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5261/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/f9f91e67c1dfc3ac3eeded69466212a1c55b2047","head":{"label":"jmerkow:image-io-u16","ref":"image-io-u16","sha":"f9f91e67c1dfc3ac3eeded69466212a1c55b2047","user":{"login":"jmerkow","id":5933681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzM2ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5933681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmerkow","html_url":"https://github.com/jmerkow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmerkow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmerkow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmerkow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmerkow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmerkow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmerkow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmerkow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmerkow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmerkow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":75320505,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NTMyMDUwNQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"jmerkow/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jmerkow","id":5933681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzM2ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5933681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmerkow","html_url":"https://github.com/jmerkow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmerkow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmerkow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmerkow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmerkow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmerkow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmerkow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmerkow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmerkow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmerkow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jmerkow/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

installed.","created_at":"2017-03-05T04:58:22Z","updated_at":"2017-05-20T19:01:35Z","closed_at":"2017-03-22T03:55:51Z","merged_at":"2017-03-22T03:55:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"21b2da07f6ff10669b7649860b913e17e6184708","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/5251/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/5251/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5251/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/e86cbd0229e2e5f5aedd3d7f221f1161193a26c3","head":{"label":"conopt:cpp-package","ref":"cpp-package","sha":"e86cbd0229e2e5f5aedd3d7f221f1161193a26c3","user":{"login":"conopt","id":2595911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTU5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/conopt","html_url":"https://github.com/conopt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conopt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conopt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conopt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conopt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conopt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conopt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conopt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conopt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conopt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59493958,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTQ5Mzk1OA==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"conopt/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"conopt","id":2595911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTU5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/conopt","html_url":"https://github.com/conopt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conopt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conopt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conopt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conopt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conopt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conopt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conopt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conopt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conopt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/conopt/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

important functionality to Caffe converter. TL;DR - it now supports ResNet models from the original ResNet git repository. They were verified to achieve test-error within 10^-4 of original Caffe model. Reshape layer support was also added. BatchNorm is now supported along with Scale layer in the sense that is usually used in Caffe (BatchNorm normalizes and Scale takes care of the beta/gamma parameters). At the momemnt Scale is only supported in this manner (i.e., it checks that it always follows a BatchNorm layer).","created_at":"2017-02-27T18:04:33Z","updated_at":"2017-07-28T19:08:58Z","closed_at":"2017-03-02T22:06:00Z","merged_at":"2017-03-02T22:06:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"b4e8743101294cf7e37510ebe4cdfd0238520156","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/5164/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/5164/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5164/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/1ee91160527a700744899a72798f7228c51ba70f","head":{"label":"nirbenz:caffe_converter_changes","ref":"caffe_converter_changes","sha":"1ee91160527a700744899a72798f7228c51ba70f","user":{"login":"nirbenz","id":4930255,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzAyNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4930255?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz","html_url":"https://github.com/nirbenz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83311852,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzMxMTg1Mg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"nirbenz/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nirbenz","id":4930255,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzAyNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4930255?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz","html_url":"https://github.com/nirbenz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nirbenz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nirbenz/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

refactor api/python/ndarray.md \r\n\r\nThe refactor consists\r\n\r\n1. operators that should be deprecated are removed from the summary list, including\r\n\r\n```\r\ntrue_divide\r\nconcatenate\r\nidentity\r\nimdecode\r\nargmax_channel\r\nbroadcast_*\r\nchoose_element_0index\r\nfill_element_0index\r\nonehot_encode\r\nCrop\r\nSequence* // we should keep SequenceLast and SequenceMask, but I did not figure out how to use them.\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. we are agreed to use lower cases for array operators, so several alias are added.\r\n\r\n```\r\nElementWiseSum  -> add_n\r\nReshape -> reshape\r\nFlatten -> flatten\r\nSliceChannel -> split\r\nSwapAxis ->swapaxes\r\nbroadcast_axis -> broadcast_axes\r\nPad -> pad \r\nConcat -> concat \r\n```\r\n\r\n3. bug fix for `rint` and `fix`. \r\n\r\n4. updated mxnet.css\r\n\r\n## discussion to make the arguments be more consistent\r\n\r\nFor example, we used several input names including\r\n\r\n```\r\nlhs and rhs\r\nsrc\r\na\r\ndata\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe can use either 1) `data`, or `data0`, `data1` for multi-input, or 2) `a`, `b` to stay the same with numpy\r\n\r\nAlso we used `axis`, `axes`, `dim` to refer to dimensions. Suggest to use `axis` for single dimension and `axes` for multi-dimensions. \r\n\r\nsome additional changes include `ret_typ` -> `ret_type` or `rtype` for `topk`.\r\n\r\n## TODOs for next PRs\r\n\r\n1. comments for neural network layers\r\n2. improve `symbol.md`

#5099 on the handling of weight decay.\r\n\r\nWeight clipping is necessary to train WassersteinGAN.

WassersteinGAN are typically trained with RMSProp.\r\n\r\nThis pull request obsoletes #5116 and introduces the uncentered version of

\r\n\r\n(Together with NNVM PR https://github.com/dmlc/nnvm/pull/105) \r\n\r\n\r\nFound some inefficiency in the system and made a few changes related to memory allocation in MXNet: \r\n\r\n1.  In the bucketing module, `curr_module` is passed in as the `shared_module`, but instead the module with default_bucket_key should be passed. [Link](https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/mxnet/blob/memory/python/mxnet/module/bucketing_module.py#L214).  \r\n2.  When the memory pool of the default bucket module doesn't hold sufficient memory for other bucket to bind, extra NDArrays are allocated. But these NDArrays are not added back to the pool.  [Link](https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/mxnet/blob/memory/src/executor/graph_executor.cc#L517)\r\n3.  While matching new memory required to the existing memory slots in the pool, the new memory list is not sorted based on size, which could result in small memory blocks occupying a big one. \r\n4. The `NNVM_EXEC_MATCH_RANGE` variable has impact on the result of memory planning. Instead of letting the user to choose it, the backend could just try different values and choose the best one to automate the process. Some users are not even aware of this variable. [Link](https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/nnvm/blob/memory/src/pass/plan_memory.cc#L299)\r\n\r\nFixing 1 and 2 reduce the memory quite a lot, while 3 and 4 bring marginal reduction if 1 and 2 are
