a Reporting Task, it re-schedules the @OnScheduled task instead of looping and calling Thread.sleep. As it was, the single-threaded Process Scheduler was, when calling ProcessScheduler.unschedule(), the unschedule task was not executing because the schedule task was using the only thread.

basic approach here is that I removed all references to Avro schemas/fields and replaced them with NiFi Record API concepts. This allows us to not have to switch back and forth, since Avro is not the de facto standard for schemas or flow file content (although we are still fairly tightly coupled to Avro schemas, but that's a different issue :) )\r\n\r\nI'll comment in the PR on various parts of the code to note the \"real\" changes to fix the reported issue.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with NIFI-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install at the root nifi folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the LICENSE file, including the main LICENSE file under nifi-assembly?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the NOTICE file, including the main NOTICE file found under nifi-assembly?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added .displayName in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

screenshots illustrate before and after for this fix:\r\n\r\nThe left one is the patched one, right one is the released one ver 1.7.1.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1107620/46198490-8d913c00-c347-11e8-82d9-729346673e53.png)\r\n\r\nBoth can receive logs

service.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1107620/46198507-9eda4880-c347-11e8-9b1c-93d3769deebf.png)\r\n\r\nRestarting services generated 2 more logs. Both processors were able to get these. However, from this point, no further logs can be consumed. Need to restart processors manually to recover. That is the issue this patch trying to address.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1107620/46198525-a6015680-c347-11e8-8c1c-8085abc88689.png)\r\n\r\nThe updated processor automatically reconnect after seeing no new logs for the configured time period.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1107620/46198536-ae599180-c347-11e8-9258-988ae4dc061c.png)\r\n\r\nThen, logs written after reconnection can be delivered successfully. See the current version misses that.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1107620/46198557-b6b1cc80-c347-11e8-93e9-d7aa6e49e90b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis commit also contains following refactoring:\r\n- Catch URISyntaxException inside subscribe when constructing provenance\r\nURI as it does not affect the core responsibility of this processor.\r\nEven if it fails to be a proper URI, if the query works for consuming\r\nlogs, the processor should proceed forward.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

refer to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-5585 for a description of use-cases for offloading nodes.\r\n\r\nA node can be offloaded by first disconnecting it using the cluster node table's \"Disconnect\" icon, and then clicking on the \"Offload\" icon.\r\n\r\nSome things that still need to be done in this PR:\r\n- [x] Integration into the Toolkit CLI for requesting the offload of a node\r\n- [x] Unit/integration tests need to be added\r\n- [x] Offloaded nodes that are reconnected need to restore the partitioner used before the node was offloaded\r\n- [x] Upgrading FontAwesome from 4.6.1 to 4.7.0 to use the fa-upload icon for the \"Offload\" operation\r\n- [ ] [**deferred to future release after 1.8.0**] On the offloaded node's UI, the status should represent its state.  Currently, a node that is offloading or is offloaded will show as \"Disconnected\" on the node's
