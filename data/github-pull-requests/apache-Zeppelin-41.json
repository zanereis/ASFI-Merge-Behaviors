One is  [**Authentication**](https://zeppelin.incubator.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT/security/authentication.html) and the other is [**Shiro Authentication**](https://zeppelin.incubator.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT/manual/shiroauthentication.html). As a user, it's little bit confused. So I changed the category of `shiroauthentication.md` file from `manual` to `security` and also changed the name of `Authentication` to `Authentication for NGINX`. Please see the below screenshot images :)\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### Todos\n- [x] - Add `conf/shiro.ini` file to `.gitignore` \n- [x] - Update `zeppelin-login.png` screenshot image file in `shiroauthentication.md`\n- [x] - Change the category of `shiroauthentication.md` file from `manual` -> `security`\n- [x] - Change `Authentication` -> `Authentication for NGINX`  \n### What is the Jira issue?\n### How should this be tested?\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n1.

No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\n\nInterpreters listed `/#/interpreter` here are slightly difficult to find, also the list that shows up for adding an interpreter is not sorted which adds effort to find the desired interpreter and the add it.\nIMO the list should be sorted and searchable.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Improvement]\n### Todos\n- [x] - Interpreter list sorted.\n- [x] - Interpreters should be searchable.\n### What is the Jira issue?\n- [ZEPPELIN-858](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-858)\n### How should this be tested?\n\nNavigate to URL `/#/interpreter` \n- the interpreters listed should be sorted\n- click on add interpreter, the interpreter drop down in \"Create new interpreter\" should also be sorted\n- the search box should search interpreters that are already listed\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-05-18 at 10 32 55 am\"

What is this PR for?\n\nAdding a python 2 &3 interpreter. It's a basic implementation (no py4j for example), with a java ProcessBuilder object used to instantiate a python REPL. \n\nThe interpreter doesn't bring it own python binary but uses the python specified by python.path configutation. Thus, you can still use your specific installed python modules (scikit-learn, matplotlib...) and the interpreter is able to work with python 2 & 3 without change.\n\nI had a python helper  function (zeppelin_show() ) to easily display matplotlib graph as SVG.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Feature]\n### Todos\n- [x] - Code review\n- [x] - Improve bootstrap.py : choose available helper functions and their names\n- [x] - Unit / IT tests ?\n- [x] documentation updates needed, that @AhyoungRyu pointed out \n- [X] LICENSE needs to be updated to include all non-apache licensed dependencies (i.e AFAIK Py4j is BSD ) in bin-license\n- [x]  double-check that code formatting conforms project style guide\n- [x]  the branch need to be rebased on latest master.\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-502](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-502?jql=project%20%3D%20ZEPPELIN%20AND%20text%20~%20%22python%22)\n### How should this be tested?\n1. In interpreter screen, in Python section, specify in python.path the python binary you want to use\n2. In a paragraph, you can use the interpreter with **_%python_**. Calling help() will describe you the interpreter functionnalities.\n3. Install py4j (pip install py4j) if you want to use input form\n### Screenshots\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12515751/14936724/5108fb60-0ef4-11e6-93ea-232a037f7957.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12515751/14943716/98a75c4a-0fe0-11e6-9d4b-e10c39d53a15.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12515751/14936715/0eec90de-0ef4-11e6-811b-7ebe46f0d279.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12515751/14943722/b89b7824-0fe0-11e6-9c73-c12f7372d487.png)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? Yes, only bin-license (py4j)\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation? Yes\n","created_at":"2016-04-30T14:58:48Z","updated_at":"2016-05-31T14:34:48Z","closed_at":"2016-05-31T14:34:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bea4bf35d1e89b3e07df064d2151f77de4dc8518","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/869/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/869/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/869/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/80b6e756161b8293c92be07ff4ba6a91a321a7b6","head":{"label":"HerveRiviere:PR_interpreter_python","ref":"PR_interpreter_python","sha":"80b6e756161b8293c92be07ff4ba6a91a321a7b6","user":{"login":"HerveRiviere","id":7195546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerveRiviere","html_url":"https://github.com/HerveRiviere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerveRiviere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerveRiviere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerveRiviere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerveRiviere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerveRiviere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerveRiviere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerveRiviere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerveRiviere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerveRiviere/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":56181318,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NjE4MTMxOA==","name":"incubator-zeppelin-python-interpreter","full_name":"HerveRiviere/incubator-zeppelin-python-interpreter","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HerveRiviere","id":7195546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerveRiviere","html_url":"https://github.com/HerveRiviere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerveRiviere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerveRiviere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerveRiviere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerveRiviere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerveRiviere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerveRiviere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerveRiviere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerveRiviere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerveRiviere/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HerveRiviere/incubator-zeppelin-python-interpreter","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nThe purpose of this pull request is to allow users to use their own credentials to authenticate with data sources.\nIt contains the following:\n- web UI and rest API to let users input their credentials\n- changes to AuthenticationInfo to add data source credentials\n- changes to Paragraph to set data source credentials in AuthenticationInfo\n- changes to HiveInterpreter to use the user credentials and simplification to use a new connection for every query. We made this change since we found an issue with closed vertica connections. Since we are using HiveInterpreter for analytics, the cost of creating a new connection is small compared to query execution. We don't have to merge this change into master.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nFeature\n### Todos\n- [x] - Save user credentials in a file\n- [x] - Do not persist AuthenticationInfo in paragraph since it contains sensitive information\n- [ ] - Add tests\n- [ ] - Add documentation\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-828](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-828)\n### How should this be tested?\n1. In conf/shiro.ini, use /*\\* = authc\n2. Login to Zeppelin\n3. Enter credentials for a data source\n4. Check if the interpreter is using the correct credentials\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\nhttps://gfycat.com/LiquidGentleKatydid\n### Questions:\n- Does this needs documentation? Yes.\n","created_at":"2016-04-27T21:18:32Z","updated_at":"2016-06-02T22:24:49Z","closed_at":"2016-06-02T22:24:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9320bf204023986c2b2b790f0586b9add769a7e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/860/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/860/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/860/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/f6d8de3fe8b6842a16a2e9e95b483c1f9fbf0193","head":{"label":"prasadwagle:ZEPPELIN-828","ref":"ZEPPELIN-828","sha":"f6d8de3fe8b6842a16a2e9e95b483c1f9fbf0193","user":{"login":"prasadwagle","id":870829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDgyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/870829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle","html_url":"https://github.com/prasadwagle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45803838,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTgwMzgzOA==","name":"incubator-zeppelin","full_name":"prasadwagle/incubator-zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"prasadwagle","id":870829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDgyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/870829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle","html_url":"https://github.com/prasadwagle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/prasadwagle/incubator-zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nThis pull request is supposed to fix ZEPPELIN-815. The issue is that one cannot stop Zeppelin by sending a signal, because it starts the runner in a sub shell. The pull request starts the runner in the same process as the `zeppelin.sh`, making it react to signals.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### Todos\n\nNone\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-815\n### How should this be tested?\n- Start `zeppelin.sh`\n- Get PID of the `zeppelin.sh` process\n- Send SIGINT (`kill -SIGINT <pid>`) to the `zeppelin.sh` process\n- Observe that Zeppelin is stopped\n### Screenshots\n\nnone\n### Questions:\n- What is the reason to put an exec into a sub shell in the first place?\n","created_at":"2016-04-19T18:12:19Z","updated_at":"2016-04-23T02:51:49Z","closed_at":"2016-04-23T02:51:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c4fd0fc1cbac42a675dc74cd47286320d1f07819","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/844/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/844/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/844/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/45896d2a9bc1f798aae2985c5345102f8a47f739","head":{"label":"FRosner:ZEPPELIN-815","ref":"ZEPPELIN-815","sha":"45896d2a9bc1f798aae2985c5345102f8a47f739","user":{"login":"FRosner","id":3427394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjczOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3427394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner","html_url":"https://github.com/FRosner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":56618213,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NjYxODIxMw==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"FRosner/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"FRosner","id":3427394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjczOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3427394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner","html_url":"https://github.com/FRosner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/FRosner/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nThis PR implements pluggable Application Framework.\n\nHere's summary of the change.\n\n**Applicaiton**\n\nBase class of user application. User application should extends `org.apache.zeppelin.helium.Application`.\n\nIt looks like\n\n``` java\npublic abstract class Application {\n\n  /**\n   * When application loaded\n   * @params context Application context\n   */\n  public Application(ApplicationContext context) {\n    this.context = context;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * This method can be invoked multiple times before unload(),\n   * Invoked just after application loaded or when paragraph output is updated\n   * @param args Required resources from paragraph\n   */\n  public abstract void run(ResourceSet args)\n      throws ApplicationException, IOException;\n\n\n  /**\n   * this method is invoked just before application is removed\n   */\n  public abstract void unload() throws ApplicationException;\n}\n```\n\n**HeliumPackage**\n\n`org.apache.zeppelin.helium.HeliumPackage` keeps information of application package.\nPackage informations includes\n\n```\n{\n  type : \"APPLICATION\",                            // type of this package\n  name : \"zeppelin.app\",                           // application name. [organizationName].[appName] format\n  description : \"App description\",                 // description\n  artifact : \"groupId:artifactId:version\",         // artifact name for maven repository\n  className : \"org.apache.zeppelin.helium.MyApp\",  // application class that extends org.apache.zeppelin.helium.Application\n  resources : [[]],                                // required resource\n  icon : '<i class=\"fa fa-clock-o\"></i>'           // icon\n}\n```\n\n`resources` field defines what kind of data this application requires, from ResourcePool.\n\"resourceName\" and \":className\" works in the array.\ninner array combines each resourceName, :className with 'AND'\nouter array combines inner array with 'OR'.\n\nFor example,\n\n```\nresources : [\n    [ \"name1\", \":java.util.Date\"],\n    [ \"name1\", \"name2\"]\n]\n```\n\nThen Zeppelin searches ResourcePool, first for resource name \"name1\" and resource type \"java.util.Date\" from resourcePool then resource name \"name1\" and \"name2\".\n\nOnce resources are found, they'll be passed to `Application.run()` method\n\n**Package Registry**\n\n`org.apache.zeppelin.helium.HeliumRegistry` provides list of available HeliumPackages.\nCurrently `HeliumLocalRegistry` is implemented and it provides list by reading HeliumPackage json files under ./helium directory in the file system. Later there will be some class like `HeliumOnlineRegistry'  which reads available package from a community managed online central registry.\n\n**Development mode**\n`org.apache.zeppelin.interpreter.dev.*` package is provided for development support.\nDeveloper can run their app inside of their IDE, that connects to running Zeppelin instance and display output.\n\n**Application Suggestion**\nOnce paragraph becomes FINISHED status after run, Zeppelin searches resources from ResourcesPool that belongs to current paragraph. And compare all HeliumPackage if these resources satisfies their requirements ('resources' field). If there're available app, Helium button will be displayed.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1540981/14518452/d8f85d5a-020f-11e6-8313-00b37eb4f077.png)\n\nUser can see and select available application for this paragraph.\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1540981/14518465/ee607fce-020f-11e6-8ad4-fe98723c7c94.png)\n\n**Application selection**\nAfter application is loaded, application icon will be displayed. So user can select and switch between apps.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1540981/14518547/6f3fd766-0210-11e6-9a08-0dc2ba6d15e3.png)\n\nif built-in visualization is available, application icon will be displayed next to built-in visualizations\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1540981/14518500/27505746-0210-11e6-9738-fb514376b906.png)\n\n**Experimental**\n\nWhile this is new feature and API and specification may change, i'd suggest mark this feature as a experimental for a while. \n### What type of PR is it?\n\nFeature\n### Todos\n- [x] - Helium Application framework\n- [x] - App launcher\n-

What is this PR for?\n\nThis PR enable Zeppelin server register Interpreters without any dependencies of their own. For instance, we should build `spark` with `spark-dependencies` even we use our own Spark cluster because current initialisation mechanism needs to all of its dependencies.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Improvement]\n### Todos\n- [x] - Add RegisteredInterpreter from interpreter-setting.json in a jar or interpreter/{interpreter}/interpreter-setting.json\n- [x] - Adjust it to Spark*Interpreter \n### What is the Jira issue?\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-804\n### How should this be tested?\n1. Prepare your own spark cluster - e.g. standalone, Yarn, Mesos -\n2. rm -rf interpreter\n3. mvn clean package -DskipTests -pl 'zeppelin-display,zeppelin-interpreter,zeppelin-server,zeppelin-web,zeppelin-zengine,angular,jdbc,spark'\n4. bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh start\n5. Check error in log\n6. apply patch\n7. mvn clean package -DskipTests -pl 'zeppelin-display,zeppelin-interpreter,zeppelin-server,zeppelin-web,zeppelin-zengine,angular,jdbc,spark'\n8. bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh start\n9. run some paragraph with simple command like `sc.version`\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation? No\n### Description\n#### This PR introduce three initialisation mechanism including current one.\n- {interpreter_dir}/{interpreter_group}/interpreter-setting.json\n- interpreter-settings.json in your interpreter jar\n- Current static initialization\n#### Initialization step\n1. Get {interpreter_dir} from Configuration\n2. Get the list of {interpreter_dir}/[{interpreter_group1},{interpreter_group2}...]\n3. Find {interpreter_dir}/{interpreter_group1}/interpreter-setting.json\n4. Find interpreter-setting.json in the resources of {interpreter_dir}/{interpreter_group1}/*_/_.jar\n5. Adopt static init\n6. Repeat them from the second step with {interpreter_group2}\n","created_at":"2016-04-14T03:16:12Z","updated_at":"2016-05-31T02:50:35Z","closed_at":"2016-05-31T02:50:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"abe2ee3bd75e7039881cc2a970801d2fd7b4d8b9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/835/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/835/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/835/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/823321e38d8d97cea9f694a1b22a5a3e5feafae7","head":{"label":"jongyoul:ZEPPELIN-804","ref":"ZEPPELIN-804","sha":"823321e38d8d97cea9f694a1b22a5a3e5feafae7","user":{"login":"jongyoul","id":3612566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTI1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3612566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul","html_url":"https://github.com/jongyoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32848214,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjg0ODIxNA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"jongyoul/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jongyoul","id":3612566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MTI1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3612566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul","html_url":"https://github.com/jongyoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jongyoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jongyoul/zeppelin","description":"Web-based notebook that enables data-driven, interactive data analytics and collaborative documents with SQL, Scala and more.

What is this PR for?\n\nUpon note.json import, do not generate a new paragraphId but re-use the existing one. \n\nThis is important because the `z.angularBind()/z.angularUnbind()/z.runParagraph()` functions are pointing to static paragraphId\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Improvement]\n### Todos\n- [ ] - Code Review\n- [ ] - Test\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n**[ZEPPELIN-741](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-741)**\n### How should this be tested?\n1. Create a paragraph with the following content:\n\n```\n%md\n## The paragraph id is &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **PUT_HERE_CURRENT_PARAGRAPH_ID**\n## The new paragraph id is **${New_Paragraph_Id}**\n```\n1. Retrieve the current paragraph id and replace the text **PUT_HERE_CURRENT_PARAGRAPH_ID** then re-execute the paragraph\n2. Export the paragraph as JSON\n3. Delete it\n4. Re-import it\n5. Retrieve the paragraph id again and put it in the input text form and then execute the paragraph\n6. Normally both paragraph ids should be the same\n7. Now clone the current note\n8. In the new note, retrieve the paragraph id again and put it in the input text form and then execute the paragraph\n9. Normally both paragraph ids now are different\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n![static_paragraph_id](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1532977/14474821/332e64d4-00ff-11e6-9441-787bb09d73d1.gif)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\n\nAs Zeppelin evolves its notebook, for large scale data analysis, multiple zeppelin users are expected to use and connect to the same set of data repositories within an enterprise. Since Zeppelin notebooks could affect data, state and its lineage, it is important to have separation of users, provide them with appropriate sandboxes, in addition to capturing the right audit details. Further, the IT within the organization would prefer to support fewer Zeppelin instances (preferably one) to support its customers. Therefore, the objectives of creating a multi-tenant zeppelin are:\n● Supporting workloads of multiple customers\n● Supporting multiple LOBs (lines of business), on a single data systems\n● Support fine grained audits\nAs a natural evolution of Zeppelin Authentication and Authorization design, partly user awareness in downstream data systems such as Spark/Hive and others, is essential to achieve the above stated objectives.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nFeature\n### Todos\n- [x] - Test case\n- [x] - Review Comments\n- [x] - Documentation\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\nZEPPELIN-773\n### How should this be tested?\n- Install Livy by following steps on https://github.com/cloudera/livy\n- Start the Livy server\n- Now by using Zeppelin-Livy interpreter, run any of the spark, pyspark or R commands.\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n<img width=\"1436\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-04-11 at 12 41 35 pm\"

What is this PR for?\n\nThis is a step towards creating a REST endpoint from resource pools  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-699\n\nIt allows resources to be downloaded from results using a REST API\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### Todos\n- [X] - Add ability to download resources via an API endpoint\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\nFinishes:  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-699\n\nNote, that this pull request is based upon these:  \nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/782\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/816\n### How should this be tested?\n1.  Edit an interpreter\n2.  Add a new property to the interpreter - the \"ResourcePoolClass\" - and assign it to \"org.apache.zeppelin.resource.VFSResourcePool\" \n3.  Run the interpreter\n\nYou should see new resource files created in notebook/zeppelin_resources\n\nThen go to \n`/api/notebook/results`\nto see the rest endpoint that lists all of the results.\n\nView it with\n`/api/notebook/[noteid]/paragraph/[paragraph id]/results`\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation?  No.\n","created_at":"2016-04-06T17:52:47Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T05:23:22Z","closed_at":"2018-05-09T05:23:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2eb7d1dcac7c794dcc0e8b17cdcdb1614a42c397","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/822/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/822/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/822/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/462cde8b657eea4f9806e1379422e5f13f5835fe","head":{"label":"fireboy1919:resource_pools_api","ref":"resource_pools_api","sha":"462cde8b657eea4f9806e1379422e5f13f5835fe","user":{"login":"fireboy1919","id":8417951,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTc5NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8417951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919","html_url":"https://github.com/fireboy1919","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45635008,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTYzNTAwOA==","name":"incubator-zeppelin","full_name":"fireboy1919/incubator-zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fireboy1919","id":8417951,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTc5NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8417951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919","html_url":"https://github.com/fireboy1919","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fireboy1919/incubator-zeppelin","description":"Mirror

Edit an interpreter\n2.  Add a new property to the interpreter - the \"ResourcePoolClass\" - and assign it to \"org.apache.zeppelin.resource.VFSResourcePool\" \n3.  Run the interpreter\n\nYou should see new resource files created in notebook/zeppelin_resources\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation?  No.\n","created_at":"2016-04-05T21:05:53Z","updated_at":"2016-04-18T14:50:55Z","closed_at":"2016-04-18T14:48:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"023821a87508a7023daa66ccb90ca2e2ee6fdd86","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/816/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/816/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/816/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/4b88b5d5775e64b003afcc596158d1d89e1918b6","head":{"label":"fireboy1919:pool_pluggable","ref":"pool_pluggable","sha":"4b88b5d5775e64b003afcc596158d1d89e1918b6","user":{"login":"fireboy1919","id":8417951,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTc5NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8417951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919","html_url":"https://github.com/fireboy1919","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45635008,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTYzNTAwOA==","name":"incubator-zeppelin","full_name":"fireboy1919/incubator-zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fireboy1919","id":8417951,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTc5NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8417951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919","html_url":"https://github.com/fireboy1919","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fireboy1919/incubator-zeppelin","description":"Mirror
