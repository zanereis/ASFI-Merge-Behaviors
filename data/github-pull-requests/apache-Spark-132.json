This isn't cheap, but this information is cached and reused in future exception logging calls. In certain scenarios involving runtime-generated classes, this lookup will fail and the failed lookup result will _not_ be cached. As a result, expensive classloading operations will be performed every time such an exception is logged. In addition to being very slow, these operations take out a lock on the classloader and thus can cause severe lock contention if multiple threads are logging errors. This issue is described in more detail in [a comment on a Log4J2 JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-2391?focusedCommentId=16667140&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-16667140) and in a linked blogpost. Spark frequently uses generated classes and lambdas and thus Spark executor logs will almost always trigger this edge-case and suffer from poor performance. \r\n\r\nBy default, if you do not specify an explicit exception format in your logging pattern then Log4J2 will add this \"extended exception\" pattern (see PatternLayout's alwaysWriteExceptions flag in Log4J's documentation, plus [the code implementing that flag](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/blob/d6c8ab0863c551cdf0f8a5b1966ab45e3cddf572/log4j-core/src/main/java/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/pattern/PatternParser.java#L206-L209) in Log4J2).\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I have updated Spark's default Log4J2 configurations so that each pattern layout includes an explicit %ex so that it uses the normal (non-extended) exception logging format. This is the workaround that is currently recommended on the Log4J JIRA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAvoid performance regressions in Spark programs which use Spark's default Log4J 2 configuration and log many exceptions. Although it's true that any program logging exceptions at a high rate should probably just fix the source of the exceptions, I think it's still a good idea for us to try to fix this out-of-the-box performance difference so that users' existing workloads do not regress when upgrading to 3.3.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes: it changes the default exception logging format so that it matches Log4J 1's default rather than Log4J 2's. The new format is consistent with behavior in previous Spark versions, but is different than the behavior in the current Spark 3.3.0-rc3.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2022-06-02T03:00:36Z","updated_at":"2022-06-02T17:39:07Z","closed_at":"2022-06-02T16:29:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d8fc8ed5a5e1970d9c8f2a865c502b26c1129318","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406607243,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA3MjQz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/GRAPHX","name":"GRAPHX","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406625202,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI1MjAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MESOS","name":"MESOS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406628559,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI4NTU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20SHELL","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRestrict DEFAULT columns to allowlist of supported data source types.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> create table t(a string) using avro\r\n> alter table t add column(b int default 42)\r\nAnalysisException: Failed to execute command because target data source type avro does not support assigning DEFAULT column values\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis change is necessary for correctness because each data source allowing DEFAULT column values must include support for returning these values when missing in the corresponding storage.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds unit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to avoid the deprecation of `spark.kubernetes.memoryOverheadFactor` from Apache Spark 3.3. In addition, also recovers the documentation which is removed mistakenly at the `deprecation`. `Deprecation` is not a removal.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- Apache Spark 3.3.0 RC complains always about `spark.kubernetes.memoryOverheadFactor` because the configuration has the default value (which is not given by the users). There is no way to remove the warnings which means the directional message is not helpful and makes the users confused in a wrong way. In other words, we still get warnings even we use only new configurations or no configuration.\r\n```\r\n22/06/01 23:53:49 WARN SparkConf: The configuration key 'spark.kubernetes.memoryOverheadFactor' has been deprecated as of Spark 3.3.0 and may be removed in the future. Please use spark.driver.memoryOverheadFactor and spark.executor.memoryOverheadFactor\r\n22/06/01 23:53:49 WARN SparkConf: The configuration key 'spark.kubernetes.memoryOverheadFactor' has been deprecated as of Spark 3.3.0 and may be removed in the future. Please use spark.driver.memoryOverheadFactor and spark.executor.memoryOverheadFactor\r\n22/06/01 23:53:50 WARN NativeCodeLoader: Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable\r\n22/06/01 23:53:50 WARN SparkConf: The configuration key 'spark.kubernetes.memoryOverheadFactor' has been deprecated as of Spark 3.3.0 and may be removed in the future. Please use spark.driver.memoryOverheadFactor and spark.executor.memoryOverheadFactor\r\n```\r\n\r\n- The minimum constraint is slightly different because `spark.kubernetes.memoryOverheadFactor` allowed 0 since Apache Spark 2.4 while new configurations disallow `0`.\r\n\r\n- This documentation removal might be too early because the deprecation is not the removal of configuration. This PR recoveres the removed doc and added the following.\r\n```\r\nThis will be overridden by the value set by\r\n<code>spark.driver.memoryOverheadFactor</code> and\r\n<code>spark.executor.memoryOverheadFactor</code> explicitly.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is a consistent with the existing behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.","created_at":"2022-06-02T00:06:16Z","updated_at":"2022-06-02T13:45:44Z","closed_at":"2022-06-02T03:10:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ff3c75053914487cfdbb44a7a508add14b51abb4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36744/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36744/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36744/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/204338bd1d3d799e733bbfd378912d2bd9ade049","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-39360","ref":"SPARK-39360","sha":"204338bd1d3d799e733bbfd378912d2bd9ade049","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"8894e785edae42a642351ad91e539324c39da8e4","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to catch asserts/illegal state exception on each phase of query execution: ANALYSIS, OPTIMIZATION, PLANNING, and convert them to a SparkException w/ the `INTERNAL_ERROR` error class.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36704.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL and unify representation of user-facing errors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. The changes might affect users in corner cases only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *KafkaMicroBatchV1SourceSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n* Fixed memory leak caused `RawStore` cleanup mechanism not to take effect due to different `threadLocalMS` instances being manipulated.\r\n* Fixed memory leak caused by not calling `ThreadWithGarbageCleanup#cacheThreadLocalRawStore` when submit background operation in `SparkExecuteStatementOperation`.\r\n* Fixed memory leak caused by instance in `threadRawStoreMap` not being updated after re-created `RawStore` instance, reference: [HIVE-20192](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-20192).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReference: [SPARK-39357](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39357)\r\n\r\nWe need to manipulate the same `threadLocalMS` instance for the `RawStore` cleanup mechanism to work, the current fix makes `ThreadWithGarbageCleanup` get the `RawStore` instance from the `threadLocalMS` instance in `HMSHandler`(loaded by IsolatedClassLoader$$anon$1).\r\n\r\nHere are some fixes I tried but didn't work with:\r\n* I tried to create `ThreadFactoryWithGarbageCleanup` through `IsolatedClassLoader` so that `ThreadWithGarbageCleanup#cacheThreadLocalRawStore` can directly get `RawStore` instance from the `threadLocalMS` instance in `HMSHandler`(loaded by IsolatedClassLoader$$anon$1), but it turned out that this fix is not feasible because In the judgment logic before calling `ThreadWithGarbageCleanup#cacheThreadLocalRawStore`, `ThreadWithGarbageCleanup.currentThread() instanceof ThreadWithGarbageCleanup` will return false and `cacheThreadLocalRawStore` cannot be called. The reason for returning false is that the `ThreadWithGarbageCleanup` instance and the `ThreadWithGarbageCleanup` **class** belong to different class loaders.\r\n* I tried not to isolate the `HiveMetaStore.HMSHandler` class in `IsolatedClientLoader#isSharedClass`, but actually found that there are too many related classes, and this class must be shared at the same time, otherwise it will cause `ClassCastException` and `LinkageError`, see [3.2 Class loading in Java](https://github.com/jboss-javassist/javassist/wiki/Tutorial-1#32-class-loading-in-java), finally I added the following code make `HiveMetaStore.HMSHandler` is no longer isolated:\r\n \r\n  ```java\r\n  val relatedToThreadLocalMS =\r\n    name.startsWith(\"org.datanucleus.\") ||\r\n    name.startsWith(\"org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.\") ||\r\n    name.startsWith(\"org.apache.hadoop.hive.conf.HiveConf\") ||\r\n    name.startsWith(\"org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.\") ||\r\n    name.startsWith(\"org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.\")\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  There are several reasons why this fix was not used in the end: First, I think this fix breaks the design of `IsolatedClassLoader`, and second, some class names that need to be shared need to be read from configuration information. Get configuration information from  `IsolatedClassLoader`does not seem to be easy, such as: `HiveConf.ConfVars.METASTORE_EXPRESSION_PROXY_CLASS`, if the user configures other custom class name, then our `relatedToThreadLocalMS` judgment may fail, resulting in `ClassCastException` and `LinkageError`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit tests passed. I have built Spark 2.4.4 with the current fix and have it in production for over a month, confirming the fix is correct.\r\n\r\nThis can be verified with the fixed production ThriftServer heap dump, this ThriftServer has been running stably for a month, I grabbed the heap dump **after a FullGC** and executed the following OQL in MAT: `SELECT * FROM org.datanucleus.api.jdo.JDOPersistenceManagerFactory`, the result is shown in the image:\r\n\r\n![JDOPersistenceManagerFactory](https://storage.tianshuang.me/2022/06/SPARK-39357-fixed-20220603135538.jpeg)\r\n\r\nIt can be seen that the size of the `pmCache` of `JDOPersistenceManagerFactory`(loaded by IsolatedClassLoader$$anon$1) is 7, instead of more than 200,000 before the fix.\r\n\r\nThen execute the following OQL in MAT: `SELECT * FROM INSTANCEOF java.lang.Class c WHERE c.@displayName.contains(\"class org.apache.hive.service.server.ThreadFactoryWithGarbageCleanup\")`, the result is shown in the image:\r\n\r\n![JDOPersistenceManagerFactory](https://storage.tianshuang.me/2022/06/SPARK-39357-fixed-20220603135907.jpg)\r\n\r\nIt can be seen that the size of `threadRawStoreMap` is 5, because the ThriftServer is idle when I grab the heap dump and the default configuration [org.apache.hadoop.hive.conf.HiveConf.ConfVars#HIVE_SERVER2_THRIFT_MIN_WORKER_THREADS](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/common/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/conf/HiveConf.java#L4071-L4072) is 5.\r\n\r\nThe two extra elements of `pmCache` are created by threads outside the `HiveServer2-*` thread pool, such as the `main` thread. In short, after the fix, `pmCache` no longer continues to grow, ensuring stable memory

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdds the corruption exception handling for merged shuffle chunk when spark.shuffle.detectCorrupt is set to true(default value is true)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPrior to Spark 3.0, spark.shuffle.detectCorrupt is set to true by default, and this configuration is one of the knob for early corruption detection. So the fallback can be triggered as expected.\r\n\r\nAfter Spark 3.0, even though spark.shuffle.detectCorrupt is still set to true by default, but the early corruption detect knob is controlled with a new configuration spark.shuffle.detectCorrupt.useExtraMemory, and it set to false by default. Thus the default behavior, with only Magnet enabled after Spark 3.2.0(internal li-3.1.1), will disable the early corruption detection, thus no fallback will be triggered. And it will drop to throw an exception when start to read the corrupted blocks.\r\n\r\nWe handle the corrupted stream for merged blocks by throwing a FetchFailedException in this case. This will trigger a retry based on the values of spark.shuffle.detectCorrupt.useExtraMemory and spark.shuffle.detectCorrupt. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Tested on internal cluster\r\n- Added UT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a PR to tackle some of the build weirdness found in PR 36601 (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36601). \r\nIt contains the exact same diff. Closed that one out and recreated it here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, bucketed scan is disabled if bucket columns are not in scan output. This PR proposes to move the check into `DisableUnnecessaryBucketedScan` and only disable bucketing when autoBucketedScan is enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe current behavior was brought in by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27924, which could break \r\nexisting applications whose input size is huge by creating too many FilePartitions and causing driver hang. By moving the check into `DisableUnnecessaryBucketedScan`, we can keep backward compatibility by disabling autoBucketedScan.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes when user disables autoBucketedScan.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdate existing test.\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-31T08:57:32Z","updated_at":"2022-06-02T00:06:36Z","closed_at":"2022-06-02T00:06:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ff7bcdc9600352cabcd1723a82c41cf9a14814a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36733/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36733/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36733/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f8539da41e0a6aca1f7eb4e9a1994321c44f6c2f","head":{"label":"manuzhang:spark-39344","ref":"spark-39344","sha":"f8539da41e0a6aca1f7eb4e9a1994321c44f6c2f","user":{"login":"manuzhang","id":1191767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTE3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1191767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/manuzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":132739917,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzI3Mzk5MTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"manuzhang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"manuzhang","id":1191767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTE3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1191767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/manuzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/manuzhang/spark","description":"Mirror

However, this introduced an unexpected limitation: the column name cannot contain dots. This makes sense for DS v2 filter pushdown to keep backward compatibility, but DS v2 agg pushdown is a completely new feature and we don't need to worry about backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes this limitation.

It also introduces a new configuration option `inferTimestampNTZType` which allows to read written timestamps as timestamp without time zone. By default this is set to `false`, i.e. all timestamps are read as legacy timestamp type.\r\n\r\nHere is the state of timestamp without time zone support in the built-in dialects:\r\n- H2: timestamp without time zone, seems to map to timestamp type\r\n- Derby: only has timestamp type\r\n- MySQL: only has timestamp type\r\n- Postgres: has timestamp without time zone, which maps to timestamp\r\n- SQL Server: only datetime/datetime2, neither are time zone aware\r\n- Oracle: seems to only have timestamp and timestamp with time zone\r\n- Teradata: similar to Oracle but I could not verify\r\n- DB2: has TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE but I could not make this type work in my test, only TIMESTAMP seems to work\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdds support for the new TimestampNTZ type, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35662.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nJDBC data source is now capable of writing and reading TimestampNTZ types. When reading timestamp values, configuration option `inferTimestampNTZType` allows to infer those values as TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE. By default the option is set to `false` so the behaviour is unchanged and all timestamps are read TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd support of stage level scheduling for standalone cluster. The feature is supported only when dynamic allocation enabled in standalone cluster.\r\n- `ResourceProfile` support creating default resource profile for standalone cluster, enable `None` value for executor cores which would take all available cores from a worker.\r\n- Enable the feature for standalone cluster in `ResourceProfileManager`.\r\n- `ApplicationDescription` take default resource profile as resource requirement description for an app.\r\n- Change standalone/master interface `RequestExecutors` to support request executors with multiple resource profiles.\r\n- `ApplicationInfo` to maintain the resource profiles and executors information, and help to make the schedule decision.\r\n- `Master` will schedule executors for one app based on resource profiles in a FIFO mode, a smaller resource profiles id will be scheduled firstly.\r\n- Add argument `resource profile id` while starting executors.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nStage level schedule already supported for yarn cluster and k8s, add support for standalone cluster.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nSince we modified the metadata of apps in master and also standalone client/master interface, so the new cluster can not work with an elder version of spark client.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT and manually test in a local standalone cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-29T14:08:08Z","updated_at":"2022-07-11T10:51:53Z","closed_at":"2022-07-05T02:19:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bf119b66ff643e5368e96ddab58fd3460973c54f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd explicitly pdf/pser infer when infer schema groupby.apply for `groupby.apply` infer schema\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe root reason of [JIRA ](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39317) mentioned `TypeError: field B: LongType() can not accept object 2 in type <class 'numpy.int64'>` is PS doesn't support init pandas df with wrong dtype when arrow disable, see below example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport numpy as np\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'B': [np.int64(1), np.int64(2), np.int64(3)]}, dtype=\"object\")\r\n# Failed\r\nps.from_pandas(df)\r\n# Passed\r\nps.from_pandas(df.infer_objects())\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that this process is only used in PS's schema inference, relatively only small data is processed. So, we can reduce the possible of wrong dtypes by calling infer_objects explicitly.\r\n\r\n**Why works with pandas < 1.4?** Unfortunately, the behavior changes of `series.replace({np.nan: None})` after Pandas 1.4:\r\n```python\r\n# Pandas >= 1.4\r\n>>> import pandas as pd\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n>>> df = pd.DataFrame({'B': [np.int64(1), np.int64(2), np.int64(3)]}, dtype=\"object\")\r\n>>> df.replace({np.nan: None}).dtypes\r\nB    object\r\ndtype: object\r\n\r\n# Pandas < 1.4\r\n>>> df = pd.DataFrame({'B': [np.int64(1), np.int64(2), np.int64(3)]}, dtype=\"object\")\r\n>>> df.replace({np.nan: None}).dtypes\r\nB    int64\r\ndtype: object\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change impacts the PS behavior of groupby.apply infer schema process

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe main change:\r\n- Add a new method `resultDecimalType` in `BinaryArithmetic`\r\n- Add a new expression `DecimalAddNoOverflowCheck` for the internal decimal add, e.g. `Sum`/`Average`, the different with `Add` is:\r\n  - `DecimalAddNoOverflowCheck` does not check overflow\r\n  - `DecimalAddNoOverflowCheck` make `dataType` as its input parameter\r\n- Merge the decimal precision code of `DecimalPrecision` into each arithmetic data type, so every arithmetic should report the accurate decimal type. And we can remove the unused expression `PromotePrecision` and related code\r\n- Merge `CheckOverflow` iinto arithmetic eval and code-gen code path, so every arithmetic can handle the overflow case during runtime\r\n\r\nMerge `PromotePrecision` into `dataType`, for example, `Add`:\r\n```scala\r\noverride def resultDecimalType(p1: Int, s1: Int, p2: Int, s2: Int): DecimalType = {\r\n  val resultScale = max(s1, s2)\r\n  if (allowPrecisionLoss) {\r\n    DecimalType.adjustPrecisionScale(max(p1 - s1, p2 - s2) + resultScale + 1,\r\n      resultScale)\r\n  } else {\r\n    DecimalType.bounded(max(p1 - s1, p2 - s2) + resultScale + 1, resultScale)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMerge `CheckOverflow`, for example, `Add` eval:\r\n```scala\r\ndataType match {\r\n  case decimalType: DecimalType =>\r\n    val value = numeric.plus(input1, input2)\r\n    checkOverflow(value.asInstanceOf[Decimal], decimalType)\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that, `CheckOverflow` is still useful after this pr, e.g. `RowEncoder`. We can do further in a separate pr.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n- Fix the bug of `TypeCoercion`, for example:\r\n  ```sql\r\n  SELECT CAST(1 AS DECIMAL(28, 2))\r\n  UNION ALL\r\n  SELECT CAST(1 AS DECIMAL(18, 2)) / CAST(1 AS DECIMAL(18, 2));\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n   The union result data type is not correct according to the formula:\r\n   |Operation    | Result Precision     |                   Result Scale |\r\n   |------------|-------------------|------------------------|\r\n   |e1 union e2 | max(s1, s2) + max(p1-s1, p2-s2)        | max(s1, s2) |\r\n\r\n  ```sql\r\n  -- before\r\n  -- query schema\r\n  decimal(28,2)\r\n  -- query output\r\n  1.00\r\n  1.00\r\n\r\n  -- after\r\n  -- query schema\r\n  decimal(38,20)\r\n  -- query output\r\n  1.00000000000000000000\r\n  1.00000000000000000000\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Relax the promote decimal precision to the runtime, so we do not need redundant Cast\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, bug fix\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter reading code changes in #35657, I guess the original intention of changing the return type of `V2ExpressionUtils.toCatalyst` from `Expression` to `Option[Expression]` is, for reading, spark can ignore unrecognized distribution and ordering, but for writing, it should always be strict.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, `V2ExpressionUtils.toCatalystOrdering` should fail if V2Expression can not be translated instead of returning empty Seq.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`V2ExpressionUtils.toCatalystOrdering` is used by `DistributionAndOrderingUtils`, the current behavior will break the semantics of `RequiresDistributionAndOrdering#requiredOrdering` in some cases(see UT).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nPulling error messages out of the code base into error-classes.json solves only one half of the problem.\r\nThis change aims to lay the infrastructure to pull error messages out of QA.\r\nWe do this by adding an central checkError() method in SparkFunSuite which is geared towards verifying the payload of an error only:\r\n- ERROR_CLASS\r\n- Optional ERROR_SUBCLASS \r\n- Optional SQLSTATE (derived from error-classes.json, so debatable)\r\n- Parameter values (with optional parameter names for extra points)\r\n\r\nThe method allows regex matching of parameter values.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPulling error-messages out of code and QA makes for a central place to fine tune error-messages for language and formatting.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nA subset of QA tests has been rewritten to exercise the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new expression `EqualNull` as a runtime replaceable expression of `EqualNullSafe` and bind the function name `EQUAL_NULL` to `EqualNull`. New function returns:\r\n- EQUAL_NULL( NULL , NULL ) -> TRUE\r\n- EQUAL_NULL( NULL , `<not_null>` ) -> FALSE\r\n- EQUAL_NULL( `<not_null>` , NULL ) -> FALSE\r\n\r\nOtherwise EQUAL_NULL(`<expr1>`, `<expr2>`) is equivalent to `<expr1>` = `<expr2>`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make the migration process from other systems to Spark SQL easier, and achieve feature parity to such systems. For example, Snowflake supports the `EQUAL_NULL` function, see https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/equal_null.html.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z null-handling.sql\"\r\n$ build/sbt

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use `LocalRelation` instead of `LogicalRDD` when creating a (small) DataFrame with Arrow optimization, which passes the data as a local data in the driver side (which is consistent with Scala code path).\r\n\r\nNamely:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled\", True)\r\nspark.createDataFrame(pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2, 3, 4]})).explain(True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\nLogicalRDD [a#0L], false\r\n\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\na: bigint\r\nLogicalRDD [a#0L], false\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nLogicalRDD [a#0L], false\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Scan ExistingRDD arrow[a#0L]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\nLocalRelation [a#0L]\r\n\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\na: bigint\r\nLocalRelation [a#0L]\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nLocalRelation [a#0L]\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nLocalTableScan [a#0L]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is controlled by a new configuration `spark.sql.execution.arrow.localRelationThreshold` defaulting to 48MB. This default was picked by benchmark I ran below.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR also fixes `createDataFrame` to respect `spark.sql.execution.arrow.maxRecordsPerBatch` configuration when creating Arrow bathes. Previously, we divided the input pandas DataFrame by the default partition number which forced users to set `spark.rpc.message.maxSize` when the input pandas DataFrame is too large. See the benchmark performed below.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe have some nice optimization for `LocalRelation` (e.g., `ConvertToLocalRelation`). For example, the stats are fully known when you use `LocalRelation`. With `LogicalRDD`, many optimizations cannot be applied. Even in some cases (e.g., `executeCollect`), we can avoid creating `RDD`s too.\r\n\r\nFor respecting `spark.sql.execution.arrow.maxRecordsPerBatch`, 1. we can avoid forcing users to set `spark.rpc.message.maxSize`, and 2. I believe the configuration is supposed to be respected for all code path that creates Arrow batches if possible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it is an optimization. The number of partitions can be different, but that should be internal.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Manually tested.\r\n- Added a unittest.\r\n- I did two benchmark tests with 1 Driver & 4 Workers (i3.xlarge), see below.\r\n\r\n#### Benchmark 1 (best cases)\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport time\r\nimport random\r\nimport string\r\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nnames =

a_name, an_age in l]\r\npdf = pd.DataFrame({'name': names, 'age': ages})\r\nspark.range(1).count()  # heat up\r\n\r\nstart = time.time()\r\nfor _ in range(100):\r\n    _ =

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe are facing the deadlock issue b/w TaskMemoryManager and UnsafeExternalSorter.SpillableIterator during the join. It turns out that in UnsafeExternalSorter.SpillableIterator#spill() function, it tries to get lock on UnsafeExternalSorter`SpillableIterator` and UnsafeExternalSorter and call `freePage` to free all allocated pages except the last one which takes the lock on TaskMemoryManager.  \r\nAt the same time, there can be another `MemoryConsumer` using `UnsafeExternalSorter` as part of sorting can try to allocatePage needs to get lock on `TaskMemoryManager` which can cause spill to happen which requires lock on `UnsafeExternalSorter` again causing deadlock.\r\n\r\nThere is a similar fix here as well:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27338\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the  https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34578 ,  it can ignore task finished events when some tasks are already finished state. But it may not be completely solved yet,  because there is no need to set the task result size in accumulator updates received from the executor when task completion events should be ignored.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReduce unnecessary calculation when some tasks are already finished state.\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd unittests.","created_at":"2022-05-25T11:43:47Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T00:27:54Z","closed_at":"2022-09-23T00:27:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e4895700cd3456d77fded9bf09ebde9ea98f19a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36665/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36665/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36665/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/02bc3cbad0796018905900978008713ad7c24fdb","head":{"label":"weixiuli:SPARK-39287-IgnoreFinishedEvent","ref":"SPARK-39287-IgnoreFinishedEvent","sha":"02bc3cbad0796018905900978008713ad7c24fdb","user":{"login":"weixiuli","id":39684231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Njg0MjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39684231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli","html_url":"https://github.com/weixiuli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":140506691,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDA1MDY2OTE=","name":"spark","full_name":"weixiuli/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"weixiuli","id":39684231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Njg0MjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39684231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli","html_url":"https://github.com/weixiuli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/weixiuli/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to improve errors of the following error classes:\r\n1. NON_PARTITION_COLUMN - `a non-partition column name` -> `the non-partition column`\r\n2. UNSUPPORTED_SAVE_MODE - `a not existent path` -> `a non existent path`.\r\n3. INVALID_FIELD_NAME. Quote ids to follow the rules https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36621.\r\n4. FAILED_SET_ORIGINAL_PERMISSION_BACK. It is renamed to RESET_PERMISSION_TO_ORIGINAL.\r\n5. NON_LITERAL_PIVOT_VALUES - Wrap error's expression by double quotes. The PR adds new helper method `toSQLExpr()` for that.\r\n6. CAST_INVALID_INPUT - Add the recommendation: `... Correct the syntax for the value before casting it, or change the type to one appropriate for the value.`\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36635.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL by making error message more clear.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it changes user-facing error messages.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *QueryCompilationErrorsDSv2Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *QueryCompilationErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *QueryExecutionAnsiErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to pass SQL config values as parameters instead of hard-code them in error messages. Also, new method `toSQLConfVal()` was added to `QueryErrorsBase` to wrap such values by double quotes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve code maintenance by separating parameters from error message texts. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the PR changes some user-facing error messages.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to make `PandasOnSparkTestCase` inherit `ReusedSQLTestCase`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe don't need this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def tearDownClass(cls):\r\n        # We don't stop Spark session to reuse across all tests.\r\n        # The Spark session will be started and stopped at PyTest session level.\r\n        # Please see pyspark/pandas/conftest.py.\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nanymore in Apache Spark. This has existed to speed up the tests when the codes are in Koalas repository where the tests run sequentially in single process.\r\n\r\nIn Apache Spark, we run in multiple processes, and we don't need this anymore.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting CI should test it out.","created_at":"2022-05-24T11:13:38Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:50:21Z","closed_at":"2022-05-25T00:56:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"821801d9d8af0a48a2b0d2942d74b4c3b1552154","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36652/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36652/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36652/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1188a0ad16a1247b8582f6717a0786fabce6a3c4","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-39273","ref":"SPARK-39273","sha":"1188a0ad16a1247b8582f6717a0786fabce6a3c4","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror
