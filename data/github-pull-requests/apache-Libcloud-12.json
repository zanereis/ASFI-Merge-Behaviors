machine was being deleted.\n\nThe issue occurs when the following events happen in that order:\n- [`list_nodes()` sends a request to list all the instances.](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/trunk/libcloud/compute/drivers/gce.py#L1622)\n  At this point, the `devops-reg` was still existing.\n- The `devops-reg` instance is deleted.\n- `list_nodes()` calls `_to_node` which calls [`ex_get_volume` which attempts to retrieve the information of the

pull request removes provider constants with region in the name (e.g. `EC2_US_WEST`, etc.) and related driver classes.\n\nWe have deprecated those long time ago and it's time to fully remove the extra code which is not necessary anymore before we do the 1.0.0. release.\n\nTo provider a better user-experience, I decided to leave code which throws a more user-friendly exception if user references a deprecated / removed provider in place.\n## TODO\n- [x] Code for enumerating available regions for each driver (e.g. `get_available_regions` class method)\n- [x] Update code which generates supported providers tables to take regions into account\n- [x] Documentation / upgrade notes changes\n- [ ] Check how this affects SaltCloud, etc.\n","created_at":"2016-03-15T22:02:13Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T15:27:51Z","closed_at":"2016-04-06T15:17:48Z","merged_at":"2016-04-06T15:17:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"a3b9da4a93536176c02238254369e14fff48e269","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/724/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/724/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/724/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/a3b9da4a93536176c02238254369e14fff48e269","head":{"label":"Kami:remove_constants_with_region_name","ref":"remove_constants_with_region_name","sha":"a3b9da4a93536176c02238254369e14fff48e269","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTA4NjI=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Kami/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kami/libcloud","description":"Apache

of the implementation in #697, I'd like to propose this instead. \n\nThe problem with #697 is that when you want to find a list of old nodes when you have a list of `Node` objects, you'd need to write:\n\n``` python\nold_nodes = [n for n in nodes if n.driver.ex_creation_time(n) > too_old]\n```\n\nYuk, why is that driver in there? Better would be to write:\n\n``` python\nold_nodes = [n for n in nodes if n.created > too_old]\n```\n\nI have implemented this code for OpenStack, Digital Ocean and EC2. Other drivers, I have no access to. In those cases, the behaviour is to have `created` be `NoneType`.\n","created_at":"2016-02-10T14:53:05Z","updated_at":"2016-02-12T08:54:22Z","closed_at":"2016-02-12T08:54:17Z","merged_at":"2016-02-12T08:54:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"a60b0729b97108c90592b44ac4a059a6ba7787c3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/698/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/698/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/698/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/72399b43bc25a201c25a7525e4a1c98e790fbf9b","head":{"label":"ByteInternet:add-created-datetime-to-node","ref":"add-created-datetime-to-node","sha":"72399b43bc25a201c25a7525e4a1c98e790fbf9b","user":{"login":"ByteInternet","id":1357758,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEzNTc3NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1357758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteInternet","html_url":"https://github.com/ByteInternet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteInternet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteInternet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteInternet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteInternet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteInternet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteInternet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteInternet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteInternet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteInternet/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":24233464,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDIzMzQ2NA==","name":"libcloud","full_name":"ByteInternet/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ByteInternet","id":1357758,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEzNTc3NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1357758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteInternet","html_url":"https://github.com/ByteInternet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteInternet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteInternet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteInternet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteInternet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteInternet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteInternet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteInternet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteInternet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ByteInternet/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ByteInternet/libcloud","description":"Apache

This pull request is W.I.P. and not yet ready to be reviewed and merged.\n\nThis pull request updates the code to use `ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23` constant for `ssl_version` attribute when establishing SSL / TLS connection when using Python >= 2.7.9 < 3 and Python >= 3.4.\n\nThis constant offers the best security and compatibility since it will pick between TLS v1.0, TLS v1.1 and TLS v1.2 depending on the version supported / requested by the server. This is only done under aforementioned Python versions since un-secure SSL v3.0 is disabled by default in those versions.\n\nIn other versions where SSL v3.0 is not disabled we still use TLS v1.0 (`ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1`) which means nothing has changed - that's the same as the old / existing behavior.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that user can also explicitly specify which version they want to use using `libcloud.security.SSL_VERSION` variable and this value has precedence over dynamically obtained values.\n\nIdeally, if users know that the server supports TLS v1.2 they should explicitly specify and use that aka the highest supported versions (that's also mentioned in the documentation).\n","created_at":"2016-01-16T14:07:07Z","updated_at":"2016-04-17T18:15:05Z","closed_at":"2016-04-17T18:15:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2b06b10a728396747ceccb9dac96732fd13d3017","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/683/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/683/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/683/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/d9eb1755c009b5c2e2fe23c3797d1f41c883b34e","head":{"label":"Kami:use_sslv23_constant_in_newer_versions_of_python","ref":"use_sslv23_constant_in_newer_versions_of_python","sha":"d9eb1755c009b5c2e2fe23c3797d1f41c883b34e","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTA4NjI=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Kami/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kami/libcloud","description":"Apache Libcloud is a Python library which hides differences between different cloud provider APIs and allows you to manage different cloud resources through a unified and easy to use API.
