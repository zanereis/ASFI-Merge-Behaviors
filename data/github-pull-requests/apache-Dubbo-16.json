What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-21T09:45:55Z","updated_at":"2023-06-22T00:49:25Z","closed_at":"2023-06-22T00:49:24Z","merged_at":"2023-06-22T00:49:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"f28c2fec72c16c6b77be1b6ad7615562f5a5eecc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12581/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12581/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12581/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0ace7deb8ff5bd94434b5cbdbbde927173c128a1","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0621_compact","ref":"0621_compact","sha":"0ace7deb8ff5bd94434b5cbdbbde927173c128a1","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-20T05:22:53Z","updated_at":"2025-01-11T18:48:54Z","closed_at":"2023-06-28T12:27:09Z","merged_at":"2023-06-28T12:27:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"1c65617fb1d25a26f54834ab36e42a1644629a91","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741981,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDE5ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/don%E2%80%99t-merge","name":"status/don’t-merge","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":"No

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-19T11:18:17Z","updated_at":"2023-06-19T13:29:15Z","closed_at":"2023-06-19T13:29:14Z","merged_at":"2023-06-19T13:29:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"a941985c9938548fe70a1e3fcc7ef97705c8d530","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12571/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12571/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12571/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6e9feeb1c39b767108fdb2396d00789115018751","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0619_check","ref":"0619_check","sha":"6e9feeb1c39b767108fdb2396d00789115018751","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-19T10:55:49Z","updated_at":"2023-06-19T13:29:25Z","closed_at":"2023-06-19T13:29:24Z","merged_at":"2023-06-19T13:29:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"8ad792c2876abb5c94b3c6393ee0ffce2117992f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12570/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12570/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12570/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/123f2ee60f9425fc3d865de25d3c01b762682a01","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0619_transient","ref":"0619_transient","sha":"123f2ee60f9425fc3d865de25d3c01b762682a01","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large,

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-19T09:17:27Z","updated_at":"2023-06-19T10:56:03Z","closed_at":"2023-06-19T10:56:02Z","merged_at":"2023-06-19T10:56:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"f81c3f3a44d3bd634f4f63fce83b0bcbaae86040","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12567/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12567/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12567/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ed6ccd864bd51bbecbbaf233a46abf5e4818b902","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0619_directory","ref":"0619_directory","sha":"ed6ccd864bd51bbecbbaf233a46abf5e4818b902","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

`grpc.version` from 1.55.1 to 1.56.0.\nUpdates `grpc-core` from 1.55.1 to 1.56.0\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases\">grpc-core's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.56.0</h2>\n<h3>API Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>api: Stabilize the <code>SynchronizationContext</code> class (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10130\">#10130</a>).</li>\n<li>api: Stabilize <code>io.grpc.CallCredentials</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10208\">#10208</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10211\">#10211</a>). <code>thisUsesUnstableApi()</code> is <code>@Deprecated</code> and has a default implementation. <code>CallCredentials</code> implementations should delete their implementation or remove <code>@Overrides</code>, as the method will be deleted in the future.</li>\n<li>api: Stabilize the <code>ProxyDetector</code> hierarchy and <code>ManagedChannelBuilder.proxyDetector</code> method.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Behavior Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>core: Sticky <code>TRANSIENT_FAILURE</code> in <code>PickFirstLoadBalancer</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10106\">#10106</a>). See <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A62-pick-first.md#sticky-transient-failure\">gRFC A62</a>. If it can't connect, pick-first will now immediately fail RPCs until after it successfully connects. RPCs will no longer be delayed while it performs those attempts, which previously could cause significant (error) latency. It now also performs reconnect attempts after failure and backoff without prompting; previously it required an RPC to trigger the reconnect. <code>ManagedChannel.idleTimeout</code> (defaults to 30 minutes) still applies and forces the channel idle after a period of no RPCs.</li>\n<li>stub: Add a null check for <code>responseObserver</code> into the methods for initiating a call that takes a <code>responseObserver</code> argument. This ensures a fail fast with a clearer cause instead of an NPE when the observer is first used.</li>\n<li>xds: Flip default for RLS being enabled to true for XDS (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10248\">#10248</a>) (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10252\">#10252</a>).  If there are no RLS configurations in your XDS or you already enabled it with the environment variable this will have no effect.  To disable it, set the flag <code>GRPC_EXPERIMENTAL_XDS_RLS_LB</code> to false.</li>\n<li>xds: Rename <code>weighted_round_robin_experimental</code> LB Policy to <code>weighted_round_robin</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10162\">#10162</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>protobuf,protobuf-lite: Allow to configure protobuf recursion limit (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10094\">#10094</a>).</li>\n<li>core: Optional address shuffle in <code>PickFirstLoadBalancer</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10110\">#10110</a>).</li>\n<li>xds: <code>pick_first</code> LB configuration (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10181\">#10181</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>xds: Add <code>error-per-second</code> in weight formula for client-side WRR (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10177\">#10177</a>).</li>\n<li>xds: Use<code> application_utilization</code> and fallback to <code>cpu_utilization</code> if unset in weight formula for client-side WRR. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10256\">#10256</a>).</li>\n<li>bazel: The README now mentions Bazel and where to find the example. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10217\">#10217</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>binder: Handle unexpected exceptions on binder threads. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10092\">#10092</a>.</li>\n<li>​​android,binder,cronet: <code>.aar</code> file when publishing. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10138\">#10138</a>).</li>\n<li>api: Fix boundary check in <code>Status.fromCodeValue()</code>. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10155\">#10155</a>).</li>\n<li>core: Don't use system Locale for content-type matching. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10097\">#10097</a>).</li>\n<li>okhttp: Fix signed-byte comparison in server when checking for ASCII in header (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10151\">#10151</a>). Without fix, authority could contain utf-8.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dependencies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Version pinning (e.g., <code>[1.56.0]</code> instead of <code>1.56.0</code>) has been removed from POMs, for both Netty and gRPC dependencies. The pinning was unreliable in Maven and ignored in Gradle, yet caused downloads during the build to fetch the version list. For a while we've had a BOM that helps reduce version skew. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10175\">#10175</a>).</li>\n<li>bazel: Add java toolchain type to all rules using <code>java_common</code>. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10225\">#10225</a>).</li>\n<li>Upgraded <code>netty-tcnative-boringssl-static</code> in <code>grpc-netty-shaded</code> to 2.0.61.Final (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10260\">#10260</a>).

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-18T09:40:03Z","updated_at":"2025-01-08T08:21:32Z","closed_at":"2023-06-19T01:33:36Z","merged_at":"2023-06-19T01:33:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"5f875ea9581373eb720ff5335db72c5b4cf7c3b3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12556/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12556/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12556/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3b1d2162ddae3a9b54a1da816dea86658830ffaf","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0618_npe","ref":"0618_npe","sha":"3b1d2162ddae3a9b54a1da816dea86658830ffaf","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-18T06:10:33Z","updated_at":"2023-06-19T01:34:07Z","closed_at":"2023-06-19T01:34:06Z","merged_at":"2023-06-19T01:34:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"3160602072c198728cca48e449984a4e596e7c37","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12551/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12551/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12551/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4276aa4c8014db94b1979f8333b28a20b686c823","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0618_rename","ref":"0618_rename","sha":"4276aa4c8014db94b1979f8333b28a20b686c823","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-16T11:40:26Z","updated_at":"2023-07-13T12:54:38Z","closed_at":"2023-07-13T12:54:38Z","merged_at":"2023-07-13T12:54:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"78ca5e523cd6969a0b7085e51d3996fd8448a55c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12547/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12547/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12547/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/607430cdc495fa2ac7db2bc4dfaef6a39df6951c","head":{"label":"finefuture:3.2-fix-Listener-unique","ref":"3.2-fix-Listener-unique","sha":"607430cdc495fa2ac7db2bc4dfaef6a39df6951c","user":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627787338,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWtGSg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"finefuture/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture/dubbo","description":"Apache

a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-15T02:44:42Z","updated_at":"2023-12-05T11:34:27Z","closed_at":"2023-06-19T03:26:50Z","merged_at":"2023-06-19T03:26:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"c96a06eba1b27300bef7a1900131b119f9b58c7c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12536/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12536/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12536/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/cceea70bf51d872f091d343dea42928751f3f7a3","head":{"label":"FoghostCn:3.3-tri-native","ref":"3.3-tri-native","sha":"cceea70bf51d872f091d343dea42928751f3f7a3","user":{"login":"FoghostCn","id":5020327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjAzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5020327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn","html_url":"https://github.com/FoghostCn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":653568896,"node_id":"R_kgDOJvSrgA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"FoghostCn/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"FoghostCn","id":5020327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjAzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5020327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn","html_url":"https://github.com/FoghostCn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FoghostCn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/FoghostCn/dubbo","description":"Apache

[multiple protocol port-unification](https://cn.dubbo.apache.org/zh-cn/overview/tasks/protocols/multi-protocols/) feature works the following way:\r\n\r\nWith the following configuration:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\ndubbo\r\n  protocol\r\n     name: tri\r\n     port: -1\r\n     ext-protocol: rest\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will create two provider urls in the registry:\r\n\r\n* rest://demo-service\r\n* tri://demo-service\r\n\r\nBut with this pull request, there will only have one url in the registry\r\n\r\n`tri://demo-service?ext.protocol=rest`\r\n\r\nConsumers can automatically tell the main protocol `tri` from the `ext` protocol,  those consumers without protocol set consume `tri` (the main protocol) while others with protocol set consume the protocol specified (for example `rest`). One consumer instance will always stick to one specific protocol for each specific service based on the protocol setting on its side, so this pull request also addresses the issue that consumers will randomly use all protocols (tri, rest in this case) for different invocations.\r\n\r\nFor application-based service discovery, the extra protocol url will still be registered to metadata, so the provide side process is not affected, what I do to this model in this patch is only to decide which protocol to use on the consumer

change\r\n\r\nI test on my local env\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-14T04:48:16Z","updated_at":"2024-09-27T06:18:59Z","closed_at":"2023-06-14T12:03:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b567a146459a8cbe681ae3e73b6792caadf55944","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12525/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12525/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12525/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4007f4b596bdf16e10c73ea1e2b25237f1dbe533","head":{"label":"songxiaosheng:fix/timewindow_concurrent_bug","ref":"fix/timewindow_concurrent_bug","sha":"4007f4b596bdf16e10c73ea1e2b25237f1dbe533","user":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":534049587,"node_id":"R_kgDOH9TzMw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"songxiaosheng/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng/dubbo","description":"Apache

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-13T12:13:50Z","updated_at":"2023-06-14T04:48:42Z","closed_at":"2023-06-14T04:48:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b80edd5fb5e332741691eaf7da952bb908f7735e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12522/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12522/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12522/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e1ab2240b57b507a7908bfae476e5f68aa8ab672","head":{"label":"songxiaosheng:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"e1ab2240b57b507a7908bfae476e5f68aa8ab672","user":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":534049587,"node_id":"R_kgDOH9TzMw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"songxiaosheng/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-12T14:42:08Z","updated_at":"2023-06-13T00:35:20Z","closed_at":"2023-06-13T00:35:20Z","merged_at":"2023-06-13T00:35:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"83b4114a9fc81bddaae6e120da33ebef29a6d44e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12511/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12511/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12511/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/fb8dfef32a2209fb463d5ed8d1805dca7dfc6c86","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0612_json","ref":"0612_json","sha":"fb8dfef32a2209fb463d5ed8d1805dca7dfc6c86","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-12T11:02:43Z","updated_at":"2023-06-12T11:28:04Z","closed_at":"2023-06-12T11:28:03Z","merged_at":"2023-06-12T11:28:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"784edd7a85e95ef1512232a13182df6b251329d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12506/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12506/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12506/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6754364078df66b04afc08f009cecb6183843808","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0612_check_timeout","ref":"0612_check_timeout","sha":"6754364078df66b04afc08f009cecb6183843808","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nPreviously, Dubbo used to dependency on the introduction of `dubbo-dependencies-zookeeper` or `dubbo-dependencies-zookeeper-curator5` for dependency transfer.\r\n \r\nIn the SpringBoot ecosystem, developers were more likely to understand starters rather than dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n- add dubbo-nacos-spring-boot-starter\r\n- add dubbo-zookeeper-spring-boot-starter\r\n- add dubbo-zookeeper-curator5-spring-boot-starter\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it).

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-09T06:55:20Z","updated_at":"2024-01-10T08:53:53Z","closed_at":"2023-06-10T10:14:30Z","merged_at":"2023-06-10T10:14:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"0f7a62a8ff2a2f3f66932cea4609ff06f90bb098","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12484/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12484/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12484/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f9e9bb61cc73b2f5c0080aa9e69233766155b032","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0609_timeout_thread","ref":"0609_timeout_thread","sha":"f9e9bb61cc73b2f5c0080aa9e69233766155b032","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-08T15:05:20Z","updated_at":"2023-06-12T04:38:05Z","closed_at":"2023-06-12T04:38:05Z","merged_at":"2023-06-12T04:38:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"51f60139f04f4834c44c54c52c81258755903bd0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12482/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12482/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12482/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4e70222d561f3cfa7880f18135006460b187e3ff","head":{"label":"JunJieLiu51520:feature/dubbo3.2_export_pathMatcher&Invoker_to_user","ref":"feature/dubbo3.2_export_pathMatcher&Invoker_to_user","sha":"4e70222d561f3cfa7880f18135006460b187e3ff","user":{"login":"JunJieLiu51520","id":42363259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzYzMjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42363259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520","html_url":"https://github.com/JunJieLiu51520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"f95111029bb36b671021583f567213c99d65538a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-08T02:29:05Z","updated_at":"2023-06-08T05:32:49Z","closed_at":"2023-06-08T04:48:55Z","merged_at":"2023-06-08T04:48:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"f35ac093539a1e49dd371bab5b8c6b38dc214cac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12477/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12477/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12477/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ce094bc5d56911320c60c31b628a5c7478912b2c","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0608_event","ref":"0608_event","sha":"ce094bc5d56911320c60c31b628a5c7478912b2c","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-06T14:08:05Z","updated_at":"2023-06-08T15:14:02Z","closed_at":"2023-06-07T07:54:40Z","merged_at":"2023-06-07T07:54:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"9af6fbf1d0d1456c18bd23bc10e447589616e98c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12469/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12469/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12469/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c648a154e604fd237d9b4f12120a2d09c97a1533","head":{"label":"conghuhu:duration","ref":"duration","sha":"c648a154e604fd237d9b4f12120a2d09c97a1533","user":{"login":"conghuhu","id":56248584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56248584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu","html_url":"https://github.com/conghuhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":544346536,"node_id":"R_kgDOIHIRqA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"conghuhu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"conghuhu","id":56248584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56248584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu","html_url":"https://github.com/conghuhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/conghuhu/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-06T04:43:22Z","updated_at":"2023-06-06T07:35:30Z","closed_at":"2023-06-06T07:35:30Z","merged_at":"2023-06-06T07:35:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"8ac29d1c82004b3ecb42ba875e86749a15d9d650","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12461/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12461/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12461/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/700288a1069389406365e4d0b6a111a261252805","head":{"label":"songxiaosheng:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"700288a1069389406365e4d0b6a111a261252805","user":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":534049587,"node_id":"R_kgDOH9TzMw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"songxiaosheng/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe previous Dubbo Tracing implementation overly relied on the spring boot starter. While providing users with better extensibility, Dubbo Tracing also loses its independence.\r\n\r\nSo I migrated tracing core from boot-start to dubbo deployer.\r\n\r\nChild Task of #12448 \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n- Add `dubbo-tracing` module.\r\n- Migrated OpenTelemetry tracer, Brave will migrate in the next PR.\r\n- Transfer zipkin and otlp exporters in OpenTelemetry. Brave's zipkin will be migrated in the next PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n#### Use SpringBoot Starter\r\n```xml\r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>org.apache.dubbo</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>dubbo-spring-boot-tracing-otel-zipkin-starter</artifactId>\r\n        </dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Use Dubbo directly\r\n```xml\r\n        <!-- dubbo tracing & tracing bridge & exporter -->\r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>org.apache.dubbo</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>dubbo-tracing</artifactId>\r\n            <version>${project.version}</version>\r\n        </dependency>\r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>micrometer-tracing-bridge-otel</artifactId>\r\n        </dependency>\r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>io.opentelemetry</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>opentelemetry-exporter-zipkin</artifactId>\r\n        </dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nLocal test result:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"810\" alt=\"d558ce91d92e234a7fba5b7e81a7f6b\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/assets/56248584/10552635-fda0-4643-b6fd-336d8bd5621d\">\r\n<img width=\"1280\" alt=\"672b23c8255b5a48fcdef30d2bd235d\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/assets/56248584/25943ed9-7a6c-4a44-9d09-abb69e3fa10c\">\r\n\r\ndubbo-samples：[https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples/pull/854](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples/pull/854)\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- Add Non SpringBoot starter Sample in `dubbo-samples`.\r\n- Migrate Brave.\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-01T09:04:25Z","updated_at":"2023-06-01T10:46:17Z","closed_at":"2023-06-01T10:46:17Z","merged_at":"2023-06-01T10:46:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"1b5ff0fc9b68da5b27a955b66190d2f5ea7c5457","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12445/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12445/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12445/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/313f50cf8599534165520c5db0f0564db0c2ac41","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0601_invoker","ref":"0601_invoker","sha":"313f50cf8599534165520c5db0f0564db0c2ac41","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-01T07:04:17Z","updated_at":"2023-06-01T10:46:30Z","closed_at":"2023-06-01T10:46:29Z","merged_at":"2023-06-01T10:46:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"f60ac914f463034df4a50e6f871ddfb146c3b541","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12439/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12439/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12439/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/af0eace3560afc8c57775e012a9dbecf51cc2e10","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0601_proxy","ref":"0601_proxy","sha":"af0eace3560afc8c57775e012a9dbecf51cc2e10","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

[dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-31T06:05:17Z","updated_at":"2023-05-31T08:06:00Z","closed_at":"2023-05-31T08:05:54Z","merged_at":"2023-05-31T08:05:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"4604b8074ab8bc60ce3eac2a54ed0e54457fea58","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12433/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12433/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12433/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/56e0dcd63d5f99a3e017da57dc5fcb879f5b6bc4","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:feat/support_serialization","ref":"feat/support_serialization","sha":"56e0dcd63d5f99a3e017da57dc5fcb879f5b6bc4","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-30T05:39:42Z","updated_at":"2023-06-03T06:47:24Z","closed_at":"2023-06-03T06:47:23Z","merged_at":"2023-06-03T06:47:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"74315babbeb4513c8b4ded4b40b0c254060ae3ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12427/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/12427/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/12427/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/15cf8b924bdf9880a4e9622f5eb5f48514a5aed5","head":{"label":"icodening:3.1_tostring","ref":"3.1_tostring","sha":"15cf8b924bdf9880a4e9622f5eb5f48514a5aed5","user":{"login":"icodening","id":42876375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODc2Mzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42876375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening","html_url":"https://github.com/icodening","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":460051832,"node_id":"R_kgDOG2vVeA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"icodening/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"icodening","id":42876375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODc2Mzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42876375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening","html_url":"https://github.com/icodening","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/icodening/dubbo","description":"Apache
