new script is designed to help automate development work on the Messages Guide. In its initial guise, the script does the following:\r\n\r\n1. Compares the text in SqlciErrors.txt with that in the Messages Guide\r\n2. Produces a report of mismatched messages. For each mismatched message it shows:\r\na. The message text in each of SqlciErrors.txt and the Messages Guide\r\nb. Any enums used in the code to refer to the message number\r\nc. A list of regress tests whose expected files might have examples of the message\r\nd. Optionally, a list of all C++ source files with possible references to the message number (this option is very slow unfortunately)\r\n\r\nWith this information a developer can quickly identify what messages in the Message Guide are out-of-date or missing. If the developer decides to change the text in SqlciErrors.txt, he/she can also see what regression test expected files need to be updated. If option d is specified (--codeRefs), the developer will also have a list of files in the code where the message is generated. But this option presently takes six or seven hours to run and so is best done overnight.","created_at":"2016-12-05T23:24:35Z","updated_at":"2016-12-06T16:54:52Z","closed_at":"2016-12-06T16:54:52Z","merged_at":"2016-12-06T16:54:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"39e524f1cd46e8739752246810122ff09f43eeb8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/866/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/866/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/866/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/statuses/39e524f1cd46e8739752246810122ff09f43eeb8","head":{"label":"DaveBirdsall:Trafodion2380","ref":"Trafodion2380","sha":"39e524f1cd46e8739752246810122ff09f43eeb8","user":{"login":"DaveBirdsall","id":5659628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5659628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveBirdsall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38782828,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODc4MjgyOA==","name":"trafodion","full_name":"DaveBirdsall/trafodion","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DaveBirdsall","id":5659628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5659628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveBirdsall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DaveBirdsall/trafodion","description":"Mirror

Causes:**\r\n1. Dealing with Varchar-oriented data input, if length of input string(end with '\\0') is larger than 32767, then there will be 4-byte memory assigned to indicate data length, otherwise, 2-byte space will do the job. While odbc driver only allocates varchar-col-length+2 bytes to store input data as well as its length, and when length of input string equals 199999, the insert will return SQL_SUCCESS but input data will be truncated.\r\n2. Say that input data type is Char, and db column type is Varchar, while odbc driver decides how many bytes in memory to indicate length of input data by length of input string, mxosrvr decides how many bytes to retrieve the length of input data by length of column type. Thus, when length of input string is smaller than 32768, odbc assigns 2 bytes for the length but mxosrvr retrieves 4 bytes including first two bytes of input data, and this causes error 8402-string overflow.\r\n\r\n**Code Modification:**\r\n1. Calculate memory space according to varchar-col-length: if varchar-col-length is bigger than 32767, then varchar-col-length+4 bytes of space will be allocated when building value list.\r\n2. Odbc driver decides how many bytes in memory to indicate length of input data by length of column type, thus the assign&retrieve principal will be identical.\r\n3. Modify sqltocconvert files to acommendate sql-c conversion with c-sql conversion in case of select failures.","created_at":"2016-11-28T06:55:02Z","updated_at":"2016-12-19T02:22:09Z","closed_at":"2016-12-19T01:53:10Z","merged_at":"2016-12-19T01:53:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"e0cf313fe755538860d2cad4a204e1f182654014","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/853/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/853/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/853/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/statuses/e0cf313fe755538860d2cad4a204e1f182654014","head":{"label":"rwbzx:TRAFODION-1262","ref":"TRAFODION-1262","sha":"e0cf313fe755538860d2cad4a204e1f182654014","user":{"login":"rwbzx","id":18119541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTE5NTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18119541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx","html_url":"https://github.com/rwbzx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70884229,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDg4NDIyOQ==","name":"incubator-trafodion","full_name":"rwbzx/incubator-trafodion","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rwbzx","id":18119541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTE5NTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18119541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx","html_url":"https://github.com/rwbzx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rwbzx/incubator-trafodion","description":"Mirror

changes:\r\n\r\n1. Noted in EXPLAIN documentation that some non-reserved keywords can be used for statement names in PREPARE but cause syntax errors when used in EXPLAIN. Noted that as a workaround, one can change the name to a delimited identifier.\r\n\r\n2. Tweaked the EXPLAIN syntax in the SQL parser to accept all one-letter non-reserved keywords as statement names. So, for example, \"explain c;\" will now work instead of raising a syntax error.\r\n\r\n3. Fixed the EXPLAIN documentation to note that one can do \"EXPLAIN query_text\" as well.","created_at":"2016-11-23T23:36:12Z","updated_at":"2016-11-28T17:03:49Z","closed_at":"2016-11-28T17:03:49Z","merged_at":"2016-11-28T17:03:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"93741f7d60d689778aa405c6e10be187a20e3a6f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/852/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/852/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/852/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/statuses/93741f7d60d689778aa405c6e10be187a20e3a6f","head":{"label":"DaveBirdsall:Trafodion2367","ref":"Trafodion2367","sha":"93741f7d60d689778aa405c6e10be187a20e3a6f","user":{"login":"DaveBirdsall","id":5659628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5659628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveBirdsall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38782828,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODc4MjgyOA==","name":"trafodion","full_name":"DaveBirdsall/trafodion","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DaveBirdsall","id":5659628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5659628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveBirdsall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DaveBirdsall/trafodion","description":"Mirror

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TRAFODION/Example+Enhancement%3A+Add+a+New+Built-in+Function\r\nThe difference is in this version, I didn't use Google's RE2, but use GNU LibC's POSIX Regexp modules. The benefit is GUN libc is already installed and it is very common, so no need to introduce a new dependency. GNU regexp follows the POSIX regular expression, although others add more features on POSIX, but this already support all basic regular expression syntax. If there are strong requirement to support more Regular Expression syntax that GNU cannot support, we can enhance it later.

Dealing with Varchar-oriented data input, if length of **input string(end with '\\0')** is larger than 32767, then there will be 4-byte memory assigned to indicate data length, otherwise, 2-byte space will do the job. While odbc driver only allocates _varchar-col-length_+2 bytes to store input data as well as its length, and when length of input string equals 199999, the insert will return SQL_SUCCESS but input data will be truncated.\r\n2. Say that input data type is Char, and db column type is Varchar, while odbc driver decides how many bytes in memory to indicate length of input data by length of **input string**, mxosrvr decides how many bytes to retrieve the length of input data by length of **column type**. Thus, when length of input string is smaller than 32768, odbc assigns 2 bytes for the length but mxosrvr retrieves 4 bytes including first two bytes of input data, and this causes error 8402-string overflow.\r\n\r\nCode Modification:\r\n1. Calculate memory space according to _varchar-col-length_: if _varchar-col-length_ is bigger than 32767, then _varchar-col-length_+4 bytes of space will be allocated when building value list.\r\n2. Odbc driver decides how many bytes in memory to indicate length of input data by length of **column type**, thus the assign&retrieve principal will be identical.","created_at":"2016-11-17T10:03:39Z","updated_at":"2016-11-28T02:14:19Z","closed_at":"2016-11-18T02:48:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b8a28f143cc8c2b8d34799c26fab40a0677007e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/838/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/838/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/838/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/statuses/c448a9fe0f42d48613da704d8347b2319881f73f","head":{"label":"rwbzx:TRAFODION-1262","ref":"TRAFODION-1262","sha":"c448a9fe0f42d48613da704d8347b2319881f73f","user":{"login":"rwbzx","id":18119541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTE5NTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18119541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx","html_url":"https://github.com/rwbzx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70884229,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDg4NDIyOQ==","name":"incubator-trafodion","full_name":"rwbzx/incubator-trafodion","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rwbzx","id":18119541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTE5NTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18119541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx","html_url":"https://github.com/rwbzx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwbzx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rwbzx/incubator-trafodion","description":"Mirror

set of changes revamps the retry logic used by UPDATE STATISTICS.\r\n\r\nThe problem was that very often in Trafodion when a DDL or DML statement fails, the transaction is aborted. (In predecessor products, the statement itself often could be rolled back without aborting the transaction containing it.) The retry loop in HSFuncExecQuery did not take this into account, so most retries would ultimately fail with a confusing and uninformative error 8605 (“Committing a transaction which has not started.”).\r\n\r\nTherefore, the retry logic has been redesigned. The logic to begin and commit transactions has been pushed down into the retry loop. The retry loop has been moved to a new function, HSFuncExecTransactionalQueryWithRetry, while the old function, HSFuncExecQuery, is now limited to non-retryable queries.\r\n\r\nWhile investigating and debugging this problem, I found several places in the code where a retry was being attempted but was not appropriate. In general, there were two kinds of issues. One was that retries were being done inside transactions having multiple statements. This is not appropriate because work done by earlier statements would be silently undone by retrying the current statement in a new transaction. The other is that some statements should not be retried. For example, an UPSERT USING LOAD with a SAMPLE clause is non-transactional, and therefore its effects are not necessarily rolled back by a transaction abort. The SAMPLE clause makes the set of data processed non-deterministic. So, retrying such a statement, e.g., while populating a sample table, risks generating more sample data than expected.\r\n\r\nSome changes were required in the use of the HSTranController object. This object is very elegant: It starts a transaction in its constructor and commits or rolls it back in its destructor. If transaction behavior matched up nicely with lexical scope, it would be perfect. Unfortunately, as described above for retries, it does not. So in places where retries are attempted, I had to remove use of this object.\r\n\r\nAn awkward change was required in the use of the HSErrorCatcher object. This is another elegant object: It is used to move any CLI errors into the UPDATE STATISTICS ComDiagsArea at the end of a lexical scope. Unfortunately, if one makes a call from an HSErrorCatcher object scope to another method that also has an HSErrorCatcher object, any errors reported in the latter get reported twice. In the past, the usual practice has been to avoid doing this by carefully choosing the scopes for HSErrorCatcher objects. However, with the current changes, there is a recursion which makes this unavoidable. The HSFuncExecTransactionalQueryWithRetry function needs an HSErrorCatcher object to capture any ultimate errors after all retries have failed. However, it indirectly uses HSFuncExecQuery to do “BEGIN WORK” and “COMMIT WORK” (as it needs to manage transactions), and that function also has an HSErrorCatcher object. To avoid having transient transaction commit conflict errors (8616) being reported in the retry loop, we needed a mechanism to inactivate the latter HSErrorCatcher object. So, a flag has been added to its constructor that optionally tells it to turn itself off. Not very elegant, I know.\r\n\r\nFinally, some obsolete code, HSTranController::lockTable, has been removed. This method used to do LOCK TABLE statements in the predecessor product, but these are not supported in

Fix for JIRA TRAFODION-2352: Propagate the CQD HIVE_MAX_STRING_LENGTH_IN_BYTES to the grandchild tdm_arkcmp process if needed to avoid possible error 8446 on Hive tables with very long varchar columns.\r\n\r\n2. Fix an unrelated minor problem: Warning 9234 may occur non-deterministically in test scripts for incremental UPDATE STATS. A previous pull request, https://github.com/apache/incubator-trafodion/pull/719, had changed most such warnings so they are emitted only when UPDATE STATS logging is 'ON'.

are three changes in this check-in:\r\n\r\n1. UPDATE STATISTICS does a ROLLBACK after detecting a SQL error. Sometimes the ROLLBACK fails, because the Executor has already rolled back the transaction. This caused UPDATE STATISTICS to get confused about transaction state. This has been fixed; now after an error on ROLLBACK, UPDATE STATISTICS simply checks to see if a transaction is still active, and if not, just ignores the error.\r\n\r\n2. When executing DDL statements, UPDATE STATISTICS tries to start a transaction. If it is confused about transaction state (as in item 1 above), it thinks this attempt to start a transaction has failed. In that particular case, no error was being reported. This has been fixed.\r\n\r\n3. Some obsolete code that used static SQL for BEGIN WORK, COMMIT and ROLLBACK has been removed.","created_at":"2016-11-03T16:50:48Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T22:37:49Z","closed_at":"2016-11-03T22:37:49Z","merged_at":"2016-11-03T22:37:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"9e37d9c22c74daee32399dac42f84c43f7141c5e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/814/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/814/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/814/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/statuses/9e37d9c22c74daee32399dac42f84c43f7141c5e","head":{"label":"DaveBirdsall:SampleTableBug","ref":"SampleTableBug","sha":"9e37d9c22c74daee32399dac42f84c43f7141c5e","user":{"login":"DaveBirdsall","id":5659628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5659628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveBirdsall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38782828,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODc4MjgyOA==","name":"trafodion","full_name":"DaveBirdsall/trafodion","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DaveBirdsall","id":5659628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5659628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveBirdsall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DaveBirdsall/trafodion","description":"Mirror

set of code changes addresses two issues:\r\n\r\n1.\tUPDATE STATISTICS performance on long character columns can be very poor. A bit of explanation: With string columns in Hive tables in particular, Trafodion by default maps these to a VARCHAR(31999) data type. For large tables, UPDATE STATISTICS uses a SQL query to compute groupings of values. This query can be very slow for large VARCHARs. Often the Hive string columns contain just short strings, so this slow performance can be annoying. But the problem isn’t just with Hive; a Trafodion table with a VARCHAR(31999) column that has just short strings in the column suffers from the same malady.\r\n\r\n2.\tCreating a persistent sample table on very long character columns (> 200000 bytes) would fail. A bit of explanation: Trafodion supports longer strings on Hive tables than it does for its own Trafodion tables. UPDATE STATISTICS sometimes creates sample tables. Today the sample tables are always Trafodion tables, even though the original table is a Hive table. JIRA TRAFODION-2251 fixed this problem for sample tables created on-the-fly. However for persistent sample tables created using the UPDATE STATISTICS CREATE SAMPLE syntax, that fix did not work. As it turns out, in order to fix the first issue above, I ended up reworking the JIRA TRAFODION-2251 fix, and in the process fixed this additional issue as well.\r\n\r\nDesign notes:\r\n\r\nWhen UPDATE STATISTICS needs to process a long character column, it now truncates the value to (by default) 256 bytes. This can enormously increase the performance of underlying SQL queries used by UPDATE STATISTICS on such columns. The trade-off is that unique entry count (UEC) may be underestimated. In particular, in the worst case, in a data set where all strings begin with the same first 256 bytes, the UEC will be mis-estimated as one! The ‘256’ value is soft, and can be changed using CQD USTAT_MAX_CHAR_COL_LENGTH_IN_BYTES.\r\n\r\nAs part of this processing, UPDATE STATISTICS also may create sample tables. When creating these tables, UPDATE STATISTICS now truncates long character columns to the same 256 byte limit.\r\n\r\nIn JIRA Trafodion-2251, we employed a similar technique for sample tables, but it did not work in the UPDATE STATISTICS CREATE SAMPLE code path. That has been fixed (ustat/hs_yacc.y).\r\n\r\nAlso, the technique used in JIRA Trafodion-2251 was to use CREATE TABLE AS SELECT in order to get the shorter columns. This is problematic for use with Trafodion tables, as partitioning is not preserved. That hurts the performance of sample table population and querying. Extending this to allow specifying partitioning appeared to be hard (because in principle, the SELECT can be *any* query). So instead, we now use a different technique. We have extended CREATE TABLE LIKE to take a new LIMIT COLUMN LENGTH TO n clause. When present, CREATE TABLE LIKE will limit any character column to n bytes. One nuance to this is that if a truncated column would form part of the primary key, the primary key constraint is replaced by a clustering key (STORE BY). We must do this since truncating values may affect their uniqueness properties.\r\n\r\nA few other small changes are present. The debug routines in NAMemory.h have been slightly changed and made public to simply debugging buffer overrun issues. Also, a clear() method has been added to NAString because I got tired of trying to figure out the NAString equivalent of the STL string clear method. So, NAString becomes just a tiny bit more like STL. Regression test compGeneral/TEST023 was enhanced to exercise code paths where long character columns are truncated. Test seabase/TEST040 was extended to include testing of CREATE TABLE LIKE LIMIT COLUMN LENGTH.\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-02T18:24:11Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T23:19:31Z","closed_at":"2016-11-03T23:11:02Z","merged_at":"2016-11-03T23:11:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"dfaaa41b044980ddf62c74b8e8778b29e3f267eb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/811/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/811/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/811/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/statuses/dfaaa41b044980ddf62c74b8e8778b29e3f267eb","head":{"label":"DaveBirdsall:Trafodion2322a","ref":"Trafodion2322a","sha":"dfaaa41b044980ddf62c74b8e8778b29e3f267eb","user":{"login":"DaveBirdsall","id":5659628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5659628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveBirdsall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38782828,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODc4MjgyOA==","name":"trafodion","full_name":"DaveBirdsall/trafodion","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DaveBirdsall","id":5659628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5659628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveBirdsall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DaveBirdsall/trafodion","description":"Mirror

set of code changes addresses two issues:\r\n\r\n1.\tUPDATE STATISTICS performance on long character columns can be very poor. A bit of explanation: With string columns in Hive tables in particular, Trafodion by default maps these to a VARCHAR(31999) data type. For large tables, UPDATE STATISTICS uses a SQL query to compute groupings of values. This query can be very slow for large VARCHARs. Often the Hive string columns contain just short strings, so this slow performance can be annoying. But the problem isn’t just with Hive; a Trafodion table with a VARCHAR(31999) column that has just short strings in the column suffers from the same malady.\r\n\r\n2.\tCreating a persistent sample table on very long character columns (> 200000 bytes) would fail. A bit of explanation: Trafodion supports longer strings on Hive tables than it does for its own Trafodion tables. UPDATE STATISTICS sometimes creates sample tables. Today the sample tables are always Trafodion tables, even though the original table is a Hive table. JIRA Trafodion-2251 fixed this problem for sample tables created on-the-fly. However for persistent sample tables created using the UPDATE STATISTICS CREATE SAMPLE syntax, that fix did not work. As it turns out, in order to fix the first issue above, I ended up reworking the JIRA Trafodion-2251 fix, and in the process fixed this additional issue as well.\r\n\r\nDesign notes:\r\n\r\nWhen UPDATE STATISTICS needs to process a long character column, it now truncates the value to (by default) 256 bytes. This can enormously increase the performance of underlying SQL queries used by UPDATE STATISTICS on such columns. The trade-off is that unique entry count (UEC) may be underestimated. In particular, in the worst case, in a data set where all strings begin with the same first 256 bytes, the UEC will be mis-estimated as one! The ‘256’ value is soft, and can be changed using CQD USTAT_MAX_CHAR_COL_LENGTH_IN_BYTES.\r\n\r\nAs part of this processing, UPDATE STATISTICS also may create sample tables. When creating these tables, UPDATE STATISTICS now truncates long character columns to the same 256 byte limit.\r\nIn JIRA Trafodion-2251, we employed a similar technique for sample tables, but it did not work in the UPDATE STATISTICS CREATE SAMPLE code path. That has been fixed.\r\n\r\nAlso, the technique used in JIRA Trafodion-2251 was to use CREATE TABLE AS SELECT in order to get the shorter columns. This is problematic for use with Trafodion tables, as partitioning is not preserved. That hurts the performance of sample table population and querying. Extending this to allow specifying partitioning appeared to be hard (because in principle, the SELECT can be *any* query). So instead, we now use a different technique. We have extended CREATE TABLE LIKE to take a new LIMIT COLUMN LENGTH TO n clause. When present, CREATE TABLE LIKE will limit any character column to n bytes. One nuance to this is that if a truncated column would form part of the primary key, the primary key constraint is replaced by a clustering key (STORE BY). We must do this since truncating values may affect their uniqueness properties.\r\n\r\nA few other small changes are present. The debug routines in NAMemory.h have been slightly changed and made public to simply debugging buffer overrun issues. Also, a clear() method has been added to NAString because I got tired of trying to figure out the NAString equivalent of the STL string clear method. So, NAString becomes just a tiny bit more like STL. Regression test compGeneral/TEST023 was enhanced to exercise code paths where long character columns are truncated. Test seabase/TEST040 was extended to include testing of CREATE TABLE LIKE LIMIT COLUMN LENGTH.\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-01T23:36:41Z","updated_at":"2016-11-02T18:19:25Z","closed_at":"2016-11-02T18:19:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/809/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/809/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/809/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/statuses/30645fe2c7a765e98d25b5b65ea4c4b3548a6447","head":{"label":"DaveBirdsall:Trafodion2322","ref":"Trafodion2322","sha":"30645fe2c7a765e98d25b5b65ea4c4b3548a6447","user":{"login":"DaveBirdsall","id":5659628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5659628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveBirdsall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38782828,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODc4MjgyOA==","name":"trafodion","full_name":"DaveBirdsall/trafodion","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DaveBirdsall","id":5659628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTk2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5659628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveBirdsall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveBirdsall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DaveBirdsall/trafodion","description":"Mirror

each authorization ID (user, role, or PUBLIC), a bitmap containing the\r\naccumulated privileges (across all grantors) is stored with the object desc.\r\nWhen the object desc is loaded into cache, the privilege bitmaps associated\r\nwith the current user, PUBLIC, and the current users' roles are extracted and\r\nunioned together to calculate the final set of privileges.  This unioned list\r\nis used during privilege checking.\r\n\r\nToday, an I/O is performed to retrieve the list of roles granted to the current\r\nuser for each object loaded into NATable and NARoutine cache.  Since this list\r\ndoes not change unless the current user changes (a new session with a different\r\nuser) or a grant/revoke role for the current user is performed, these extra\r\nI/O's are not needed.\r\n\r\nTo remove the extra I/O's for each object, the list of roles will be stored in\r\nthe ContextCli.  Therefore, this in-memory role list can be used instead of\r\nrereading metadata.\r\n\r\nThis checkin creates two new CLI requests:\r\n- GetRoleList - returns the list of roles associated with the user\r\n    If the list exists in ContextCli, it returns the stored values\r\n    If the list does not exist, it retrieves them from Metadata, stores\r\n      them and returns the values\r\n- ResetRoleList - removes the list of roles from ContextCli\r\n\r\nThe first time GetRoleList is called in a session, the users' roles are\r\nstored in ContextCli.  They remain in memory until the session ends and\r\nrestarts as a different user, or another process grants or revokes a role\r\nfrom the current user.\r\n\r\nIf another process revokes a role from the current user, a query invalidation\r\nkey is created.  When the revoke role query invalidation key for the current\r\nuser is detected, ResetRoleList is called.  The next time GetRoleList is called\r\nan updated role list is retrieved from metadata and stored in ContextCli.\r\n\r\nIf another process grants a role to the current user, there could be two\r\noutcomes.  If the current user already has the privilege from another source\r\nthen nothing happens.  If the current user does not have the privilege, then\r\none recompilation is attempted.  Prior to performing the retry, code was\r\nadded to ResetRoleList.  The recompilation then gets the latest role list and\r\neither succeeds or fails depending on the granted

is a first set of changes to allow us to make use of CTEs\n(Common Table Expressions) declared in WITH clauses and to create\na temp table for them that is then read multiple times in the query.\n\nThis also includes a fix for\n[TRAFODION-2280] Need to remove salt columns from uniqueness constraints\n\nSummary of changes:\n- Adding a unique statement number in CmpContext\n- Moving the execHiveSQL method from the OSIM code to CmpContext\n- Adding a list of common subexpressions and their references\n  to CmpStatement\n- Adding the ability to the Hive Truncate operator to drop the\n  table when the TCB gets deallocated\n- Adding the ability to the HDFS scan to compute scan ranges at\n  runtime. Those are usually determined in the compiler. This is\n  only supported for simple, non-partitioned, delimited tables.\n  We need this because we populate the temp table and read from\n  in in the same statement, without the option of compiling\n  after we inserted into the temp table.\n- Special handling in the MapValueIds node of common subexpressions.\n  See the comment in MapValueId::preCodeGen().\n- Moved the binder code to create a FastExtract node into a new\n  method FastExtract::makeFastExtractTree(), to be able to call\n  it from another place.\n- MapValueIds no longer looks at the \"used by MVQR flag\" to determine\n  the method for VEGRewrite. Instead it checks whether a list of\n  values has been provided to do this.\n- Adding a new method, RelExpr::prepareMeForCSESharing, that is\n  kind of an \"unnormalizer\", undoing some of the normalizer\n  transformations.\n- Implementing the steps for common subexpression materializations\n  described below.\n- Adding the ability to suppress the Hive timestamp modification\n  check when truncating a Hive table\n- Adding an optimizer rule to eliminate CommonSubExprRef nodes.\n  These nodes should not normally survive past the SQO phase, but\n  if the SQO phase gets interrupted by an exception, that could\n  happen, since we then fall back to a copy of the tree before\n  SQO. In the future, we can consider cost-based decision on\n  what to do with common subexpressions.\n- Adding CommonSubExprRef nodes in the parser whenever we expand\n  a CTE reference.\n- Adding cleanup code to the \"cleanup obsolete volatile tables\"\n  command that removes obsolete Hive tables used for common\n  subexpressions.\n\nOther changes contained in this change set:\n- Optimization for empty scans, like select \\* from t where 1=0\n  This now generates a cardinality constraint with 0 rows, which\n  can be used later to eliminate parts of a tree.\n  (file OptLogRelExpr.cpp)\n- [TRAFODION-2280] Need to remove salt columns from uniqueness\n  constraints generated on salted tables.\n  (file OptLogRelExpr.cpp)\n- Got rid of the now meaningless \"seamonster\" display in EXPLAIN.\n  (file GenExplain.cpp and misc. expected files)\n- Suppress display of \"zombies\" in the cstat command. Otherwise,\n  these zombies (marked as <defunct>) prevent Trafodion from\n  starting, because they are incorrectly considered \"orphan\"\n  processes. This could require a reboot when no reboot is necessary.\n  (file core/sqf/sql/scripts/pstat)\n\nIncomplete list of things left to be done:\n- TRAFODION-2316: Hive temp tables are not secure.

It marks the common\nsubexpressions in a RelExpr tree. This operator remembers the name of\na common subexpression (e.g. the name used in the WITH clause).\nMultiple such operators can reference to the same name. Each of\nthese references has a copy of the tree.\n\nRight now, these operators are created in the parser when we expand a\nCTE (Common Table Expression), declared in a WITH clause.  If the CTE\nis referenced only once, then the CommonSubExprRef operator is removed\nin the binder - it also doesn't live up to its name in this case.\n\nThe remaining CommonSubExprRef operators keep track of various changes\nto their child trees, during the binder and normalizer phases.  In\nparticular, it tracks which predicates are pushed down into the child\ntree and which outputs are eliminated.\n\nThe CmpStatement object keeps a global list of all the\nCommonSubExprRef operators in a statement, so the individual operators\nhave a way to communicate with their siblings:\n- A statement can have zero or more named common subexpressions.\n- Each reference to a common subexpression is marked in the RelExpr\n  tree with a CommonSubExprRef node.\n- In the binder and normalizer, common subexpressions are expanded,\n  meaning that multiple copies of them exist, one copy per\n  CommonSubExprRef.\n- Common subexpressions can reference other common subexpressions,\n  so they, together with the main query, for a DAG (directed\n  acyclic graph) of dependencies.\n- Note that CTEs declared in a WITH clause but not referenced are\n  ignored and are not part of the query tree.\n\nIn the semantic query optimization phase (SQO), the current code makes\na heuristic decision what to do with common subexpressions - to\nevaluate them multiple times (expand) or to create a temporary table\nonce and read that table multiple times.\n\nIf we decide to expand, the action is simple: Remove the\nCommonSubExprRef operator from the tree and replace it with its child.\n\nIf we decide to create a temp table, things become much more difficult.\nWe need to do several steps:\n- Pick one of the child trees of the CommonSubExprRefs as the one to\n  materialize.\n- Undo any normalization steps that aren't compatible with the other\n  CommonSubExprRefs. That means pulling out predicates that are not\n  common among the references and adding back outputs that are\n  required by other references. If that process fails, we fall back\n  and expand the expressions.\n- Create a temp table tmp.\n- Prepare an INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE tmp SELECT \\* FROM cse tree\n  that materializes the common subexpression in a table.\n- Replace the CommonSubExprRef nodes with scans of the temp table.\n- Hook up the insert query tree with the main query, such that it\n  is executed before the main query starts.\n## Temporary tables\n\nAt this time, temporary tables are created as Hive tables, with a\nfabricated, unique name, including the session id, a unique statement\nnumber within the session, and a unique identifier of the common\nsubexpression within the statement. The temporary table is created at\ncompile time. The query plan contains an operator to truncate the\ntable before populating it. The \"temporary\" Hive table is dropped when\nthe executor TCB is deallocated.\n\nSeveral issues are remaining with this approach:\n- If the process exits before executing and deallocating the statement,\n  the Hive table is not cleaned up.\n  Solution (TBD): Clean up these tables like we clean up left-over\n  volatile tables. Both are identified by the session id.\n- If the executor runs into memory pressure and deallocates the TCB,\n  then allocates it again at a later time, the temp table is no longer\n  there.\n  Solution (TBD): Use AQR to recompile the query and create a new table.\n- Query cache: If we cache a query, multiple queries may end up with\n  the same temporary table. This works ok as long as these queries are\n  executed serially, but it fails if both queries are executed at the\n  same time (e.g. open two cursors and fetch from both, alternating).\n  Solution (TBD): Add a CQD that disables caching queries with temp tables\n  for common subexpressions.\n\nIn the future we also want to support volatile tables. However, those also\nhave issues:\n- Volatile tables aren't cleaned up until the session ends. If we run\n  many statements with common subexpressions, that is undesirable. So,\n  we have a similar cleanup problem as with Hive tables.\n- Volatile tables take a relatively long time to create.\n- Insert and scan rates on volatile Trafodion tables are slower than\n  those on Hive tables.\n\nTo-do items are marked with \"Todo: CSE: \" in the code.\n","created_at":"2016-10-27T20:03:17Z","updated_at":"2016-10-31T22:55:21Z","closed_at":"2016-10-31T22:55:21Z","merged_at":"2016-10-31T22:55:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"8f4864034d2c162f6efab818e18a8ba4e2035dea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/794/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/794/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/794/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/statuses/8f4864034d2c162f6efab818e18a8ba4e2035dea","head":{"label":"zellerh:cses_1026","ref":"cses_1026","sha":"8f4864034d2c162f6efab818e18a8ba4e2035dea","user":{"login":"zellerh","id":7062636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjI2MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7062636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh","html_url":"https://github.com/zellerh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zellerh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"2d93f397be6df27943e8a99d9454642ead4571ae","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":36349344,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjM0OTM0NA==","name":"trafodion","full_name":"apache/trafodion","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion","description":"Apache
