Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1655 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nJackson was upgraded in helix from 1.x to 2.x (https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/1293). Jackson 1.x does not support Jackson 2.x annotations.\r\n\r\nThis PR rolls back Jackson 2 annotations to Jackson 1, and adds a custom `CodehausJacksonAnnotationIntrospector` to make Jackson 2 work with Jackson 1 annotations. The custom \"CodehausJacksonAnnotationIntrospector\" is based on Jackson's recommendation on GitHub doc: https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations,\r\nBackwards compatibility: You can make Jackson 2 use Jackson 1 annotations with [jackson-legacy-introspector](https://github.com/Laures/jackson-legacy-introspector)\r\n\r\nThe introspector is simplified and customized to ONLY work with Jackson 1 annotations in helix. It is implemented for backward compatibility, and should be deprecated once all Jackson 1 annotations are upgrade/removed in Helix.\r\n\r\nClasses that roll back to use Jackson 1 annotations:\r\n- `ZNRecord`\r\n- `SessionAwareZNRecord`\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n - `testCodehausJacksonSerializer`\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nzookeeper-api\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 53, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 67.799 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 53, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:11 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-02-26T17:56:52-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nhelix-core\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1264, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 4,989.124 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1264, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:23 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-02-28T14:25:40-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nhelix-rest\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 171, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 93.342 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 171, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:38 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-02-27T21:08:48-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1614 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe current implementation offers a unified control for both baseline movements and bestPossible movements, but it's growing more apparent that we need more flexible controls. For example, allowing more aggressive convergence to baseline movements (higher weight) is now combined with limiting movements based on best possible states (higher weight), but these two effects are contradicting. Baseline convergence should be a \"evenness\" focused constraint, while limiting movements based on best possible should be a \"less movement\" constraint.\r\n\r\nThis PR splits `PartitionMovementConstraint` into separate constraints that control baseline convergence and best possible movements respectively. Those factors allow an option to, for example, let baseline completely override best possible and force a baseline convergence, or to let baseline only influence the decision similar to the usual Waged configurations. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\nChanged TestPartitionMovementConstraint; Added testGetRebalancePreferenceMissingKey, testSetRebalancePreferenceMissingKey\r\n```\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1265, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5,209.189 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1265, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:26 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-03-05T18:14:05-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nfix #1651\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn current Waged implementation, TopStateAntiAffinityConstraint is in charge of spreading out top state replicas and it's based on replica count instead of weights. Originally, this decision was made because we assume replica weight evenness is already handled by MaxCapacityUsageInstanceConstraint; however, real usage has proven that top state replica weight evenness is very bad, while regular state replica weight evenness is good. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we need a weight-based constraint to spread top state replicas out. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1260, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5,482.904 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1260, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:31 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-03-01T13:13:15-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-21T23:29:19Z","updated_at":"2021-03-01T21:40:05Z","closed_at":"2021-03-01T21:40:04Z","merged_at":"2021-03-01T21:40:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"128ccded98295638320e45e148cb556bc61591c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1652/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1652/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1652/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/ff7bd552a8b06d4802c5bce82598e8d4fb9022e6","head":{"label":"NealSun96:nealsun/topState-weight-constraint-and-tuning","ref":"nealsun/topState-weight-constraint-and-tuning","sha":"ff7bd552a8b06d4802c5bce82598e8d4fb9022e6","user":{"login":"NealSun96","id":18000949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAwOTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18000949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96","html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":233725825,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzM3MjU4MjU=","name":"helix","full_name":"NealSun96/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NealSun96","id":18000949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAwOTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18000949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96","html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1648 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAssume enter M mode threshold is 5. Now 20 nodes are down at the same time, the running pipeline creates the maintenance znode. Instead of using the maintenance rebalancer immediately, this running pipeline still continues with the normal rebalancer, which bootstraps new partitions on the online instances. The following pipelines after this running pipeline will use the maintenance rebalancer.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves auto enter maintenance mode logic by enabling maintenance mode in the data cache, so the best possible mapping can be computed by the maintenance rebalancer immediately for the first pipeline.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n  `testAutoEnterMaintenanceWhenExceedingOfflineNodes`\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2021-02-17T10:22:16.4954654Z [ERROR] Tests run: 1263, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5,150.633 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n2021-02-17T10:22:16.4957382Z [ERROR] testMultipleJobAssignment(org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestTaskAssignmentCalculator)  Time elapsed: 0.645 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\n2021-02-17T10:22:16.4959646Z java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<5> but was:<4>\r\n2021-02-17T10:22:16.4969348Z \tat org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestTaskAssignmentCalculator.testMultipleJobAssignment(TestTaskAssignmentCalculator.java:127)\r\n2021-02-17T10:22:16.4972230Z \r\n2021-02-17T10:22:16.8778474Z [ERROR] Failures: \r\n2021-02-17T10:22:16.8786962Z [ERROR]   TestTaskAssignmentCalculator.testMultipleJobAssignment:127 expected:<5> but was:<4>\r\n2021-02-17T10:22:16.8791240Z [ERROR] Tests run: 1263, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 12.61 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestTaskAssignmentCalculator\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  18.801 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-02-17T22:45:49-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

This section of code was under old assumptions that became outdated during its development. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1636 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nHelix ST cancellation is a feature that helix can cancel pending or ongoing partition assignment state transitions(ST) that are unnecessary due to some reasons, eg. pending state does not match the target state. The feature expects ST messages are only sent by helix controller so controller knows what kind of ST can be cancelled.\r\n\r\nRoot cause: When SN resets partition with ERROR -> OFFLINE ST, helix controller determines it is an unnecessary ST so it sends out cancellation, which is expected for helix ST cancellation feature.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves it by skipping cancelling the reset ST sent by Admin or participant.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a logic: Helix controller should not cancel the pending ST if the pending ST is ERROR -> initialState\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n - `testNoCancellationForErrorReset`\r\n - `testCancelOnlineToOffline`\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nTests in helix-core\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1260, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5,600.299 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1260, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:33 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-02-04T20:21:07-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nenhance #343; second part: message classification, basic throttle logic application. Also base test cases.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nSecond part of Per Replica throttling. Message classification, basic throttle logic namely classifying the messages to load/recovery, throttle each according to configuration.\r\n\r\nPer replica throttling replacing intermediate stage which is partition based. The finer granularity\r\nwould skip boosting unnecessary replica in a recovery partition.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-04T06:07:08Z","updated_at":"2021-05-07T18:08:51Z","closed_at":"2021-05-07T18:07:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1a01c7c11bb5197eba577b1658894fdce58b59b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1628/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1628/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1628/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/c2c4bc9e1aa9e2bd2b13cd131d440704510e6be0","head":{"label":"kaisun2000:throttle_main","ref":"throttle_main","sha":"c2c4bc9e1aa9e2bd2b13cd131d440704510e6be0","user":{"login":"kaisun2000","id":52840222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQwMjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52840222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaisun2000","html_url":"https://github.com/kaisun2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaisun2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaisun2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaisun2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaisun2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaisun2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaisun2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaisun2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaisun2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaisun2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":196650309,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY2NTAzMDk=","name":"helix","full_name":"kaisun2000/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kaisun2000","id":52840222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQwMjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52840222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaisun2000","html_url":"https://github.com/kaisun2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaisun2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaisun2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaisun2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaisun2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaisun2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaisun2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaisun2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaisun2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaisun2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kaisun2000/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFix #1626 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIf zkAddress is null for the HelixManager passed to TaskStateModelFactory and multizk is not enabled, a NullPointerException will be raised. This PR fixes that by adding a null check. \r\n\r\nWhen https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/1183 was introduced and null checks were added, this section of code was in a feature branch, and was therefore not covered by the PR 1183. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-02T23:37:07Z","updated_at":"2021-02-03T01:57:24Z","closed_at":"2021-02-03T01:57:24Z","merged_at":"2021-02-03T01:57:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"2ce66cb7f5a33c9a0161f11b30833057604823ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1627/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1627/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1627/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/e879efbda1cc6e5ce0f36c5a0cb7f243496fd304","head":{"label":"NealSun96:nealsun/hotfix-task-state-model-factory-zkaddress-null","ref":"nealsun/hotfix-task-state-model-factory-zkaddress-null","sha":"e879efbda1cc6e5ce0f36c5a0cb7f243496fd304","user":{"login":"NealSun96","id":18000949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAwOTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18000949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96","html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":233725825,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzM3MjU4MjU=","name":"helix","full_name":"NealSun96/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NealSun96","id":18000949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAwOTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18000949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96","html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96/helix","description":"Mirror

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-01T19:31:42Z","updated_at":"2021-02-01T22:53:34Z","closed_at":"2021-02-01T22:53:34Z","merged_at":"2021-02-01T22:53:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"fcc1ce6d3130232b5f774e6f46a0af45d94f96ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1625/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1625/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1625/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/391205cf0e9225848a627ead306552ec8d153574","head":{"label":"alirezazamani:disable_instance_currentstate_drop","ref":"disable_instance_currentstate_drop","sha":"391205cf0e9225848a627ead306552ec8d153574","user":{"login":"alirezazamani","id":9290963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTA5NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9290963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani","html_url":"https://github.com/alirezazamani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":197044045,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTcwNDQwNDU=","name":"helix","full_name":"alirezazamani/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"alirezazamani","id":9290963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTA5NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9290963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani","html_url":"https://github.com/alirezazamani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/alirezazamani/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nBackport PR#785 to fix #784 to next 0.9.x release. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nFixes possible `ConcurrentModificationException` and `NullPointerException` when accessing `_eventAttributeMap ` in `ClusterEvent`. The `NullPointerException` can happen if one thread triggers resizing of the `_eventAttributeMap ` and while the resizing is in progress, another thread tries to access value which is not yet added to the resized map.\r\n\r\nThis is basically just cherry-picking commit for #785 to helix-0.9.x branch.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-22T11:59:03Z","updated_at":"2021-01-29T22:44:30Z","closed_at":"2021-01-29T22:44:30Z","merged_at":"2021-01-29T22:44:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"bcad17768a5d84f47ba2d4b47cf77b7c83f452d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1621/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1621/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1621/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/f4518caee973131dd2bdd54e16c794c90945408f","head":{"label":"AriVuolas:backport-764-clusterevent","ref":"backport-764-clusterevent","sha":"f4518caee973131dd2bdd54e16c794c90945408f","user":{"login":"AriVuolas","id":22314794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzE0Nzk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22314794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AriVuolas","html_url":"https://github.com/AriVuolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AriVuolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AriVuolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AriVuolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AriVuolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AriVuolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AriVuolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AriVuolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AriVuolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AriVuolas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":330927552,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzA5Mjc1NTI=","name":"helix","full_name":"AriVuolas/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AriVuolas","id":22314794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzE0Nzk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22314794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AriVuolas","html_url":"https://github.com/AriVuolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AriVuolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AriVuolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AriVuolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AriVuolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AriVuolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AriVuolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AriVuolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AriVuolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AriVuolas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AriVuolas/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1614 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR splits `PartitionMovementConstraint` into separate constraints that control baseline movements and bestPossible movements respectively. The current implementation offers a unified control for both baseline movements and bestPossible movements, but it's growing more apparent that a separate control is beneficial. For example, allowing more aggressive baseline movements while limiting bestPossible movements is suitable for clusters that are migrating from non-Waged (the partitions of which are usually not balanced) to Waged. The splitting unlocks movement controls in global rebalance and partial rebalance to allow maximum flexibility. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1258, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5,128.737 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testParallelismInStateModel(org.apache.helix.integration.TestPreferenceListAsQueue)  Time elapsed: 10.267 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.TestPreferenceListAsQueue.runTest(TestPreferenceListAsQueue.java:216)\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.TestPreferenceListAsQueue.testParallelismInStateModel(TestPreferenceListAsQueue.java:130)\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestPreferenceListAsQueue.testParallelismInStateModel:130->runTest:216 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1258, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:25 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-02-01T19:03:43-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\nRerun\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 12.296 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.TestPreferenceListAsQueue\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  19.634 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-02-02T10:18:54-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1596 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nSince current states are created on the participant side, assertions performed on them are advised to be implemented with `verify` instead of a plain assertion. TestTaskCurrentStatePathDisabled could be unstable due to the `assertNotNull` it performs on current states. It's possible that at the time of checking, current states are not created yet, causing the test to fail. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1255, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5,272.263 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1255, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:27 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-01-05T17:00:27-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-05T20:03:28Z","updated_at":"2021-01-06T23:18:53Z","closed_at":"2021-01-06T23:18:52Z","merged_at":"2021-01-06T23:18:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"d67e1e52a918701bc4fdbe357bacc88af0ba8700","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1597/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1597/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1597/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/1ec576dffc8332a18ca5d9872e13aceec806581d","head":{"label":"NealSun96:nealsun/stabalize-TestTaskCurrentStatePathDisabled","ref":"nealsun/stabalize-TestTaskCurrentStatePathDisabled","sha":"1ec576dffc8332a18ca5d9872e13aceec806581d","user":{"login":"NealSun96","id":18000949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAwOTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18000949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96","html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":233725825,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzM3MjU4MjU=","name":"helix","full_name":"NealSun96/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NealSun96","id":18000949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAwOTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18000949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96","html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1591 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nZkClient asyncCreate() has a mechanism to retry the operation if the KeeperException code is retryable. The method `doRetry()` will push next retry to the retry queue if the error code is retryable such as connection loss or session expired.\r\n\r\nBut in the retry run, if `ZkSessionMismatchedException` is thrown from `getExpectedZookeeper()`, the actual async callback is neither being retried nor cancelled - the retry request is neither pushed to the retry queue nor canceled, then there is no chance the operation is finished. It is like a lock, the lock is not released, then the caller calls `wait()` will keep waiting forever.\r\n\r\nImpact:\r\nThis issue blocks following pipeline running.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nOnce an exception is thrown during the retry run, the callback context should be cancelled correctly.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n- testAsyncWriteRetryThrowException\r\n- testAsyncWriteByExpectedSession\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nIn zookeeper-api\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 51, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 64.415 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 51, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:08 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-12-10T15:34:19-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nHelix-core\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1253, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5,328.498 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1253, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:28 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-12-11T17:53:11-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nTo address excessive ZooKeeper reads caused by task framework CurrentState updates, it is proposed to move task framework CurrentStates to their separate path. \r\n\r\nThe change is divided to multiple phases. This is the second phase, where the main focus of the changes are on the participant side. A system property flag is created to disable this feature when necessary. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestTaskCurrentStatePathDisabled, testCurrentStatesRoutingTableIgnoreTaskCurrentStates\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1253, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5,111.4 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1253, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:25 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-12-09T16:24:22-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#1578 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIt was observed that the set methods in the Helix Data Provider classes, which are used but the Helix tools or tests, are not updating the derived fields.\r\nThis makes the override incomplete and it causes some potential issues when the tools are used.\r\nThis PR ensures that the set methods are modifying important derived fields.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nThe main changed logic has been covered by the existing tests.\r\nIt is hard, and maybe not a good idea to cover all the possible util tool usages.\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestDisableCustomCodeRunner.test:236 expected:<false> but

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1569 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCustomRestClientImpl serializes the partitions list to a string before sending the payloads to the custom client health check Rest API. The custom client is expecting a list of partitions, but received a string. So the custom client returns an error 400. But actually the partitions are healthy. This is caused by the serialization/deserialization inconsistency between helix rest and custom client rest.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST  http://localhost:11933/partitionHealthStatus -d '{\"partitions\":[\"p1\"]}'\r\n```\r\nworks but Helix will actually send below that doesn't work.\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST  http://localhost:11933/partitionHealthStatus -d '{\"partitions\":\"[\\\"p1\\\"]\"}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nManually tested by connecting to the SN. Payloads are printed out as expected: list of partitions, instead of a string. The response from SN is 200.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nhelix rest tests:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 171, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 102.032 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 171, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:48 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-12-01T11:26:32-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixed #1563 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrent version of Helix lock does not support priority or preemption, meaning that if a client acquires a lock, no other client can grab it until it's timed out or released. This restricts the usage of Helix lock. In many occasions, priority and preemption is needed for lock, and preferably, when the lower priority client is preempted, it could be notified and given some time to bring the system back to stable state, e.g. do some rollback, etc. \r\nIn this PR, we define a few concepts of the lock, like priority, different timeout, and whether the lock is forceful. These parameters of a lock will determine how Helix would handle the acquire request.\r\nWe also leverage Zookeeper to perform the notification and client would need to implement the cleanup callback if it is preempted.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nTestZKHelixNonblockingLockWithPriority\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nhelix-core:\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1253, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5,070.423 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1253, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:24 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-12-14T13:37:09-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                                                                                    \r\n                                                                                   \r\n\r\nhelix-rest:\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 171, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 239.077 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 171, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  04:03 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-12-14T12:19:14-08:00\r\n[INFO] -------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1561\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nZkBaseDataAccessor and Helix API that uses it using its Builder were having zkClient thread leak issues because the usesExternalZkClient flag was not being set properly. Also, the family of Verifiers were having a similar issue. This change solves this by making sure the private/protected constructors used by the Builders of these classes set the flag correctly to false so that in their respective close() functions, the underlying zkClient (created by the Builder) would get closed.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nManually monitored and tested\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n> [INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1251, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:25 h\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#1336  \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe test is constantly failing on master now. The direct reason is the same, there is an empty INSTANCE_CAPACITY_KEYS=[], list so we get a IndexOutOfBoundsException error.\r\n\r\nMy theory is that, this empty list could be added by TestInstancesAccessor.testValidateWeightForAllInstances() or TestPerInstanceAccessor.testValidateWeightForInstance() since these two tests and TestClusterAccessor.testUpdateConfigFields() uses the same cluster \"TestCluster_0\".\r\n\r\nIn the test log where testUpdateConfigFields is failing, the two tests that added this empty list always happens before this testUpdateConfigFields.\r\n\r\nMy solution is simply changing the cluster for testUpdateConfigFields to another test cluster and use \"TestCluster_0\" only for WAGED related tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 171, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 246.815 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 171, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  04:10 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-11-25T11:20:46-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1549 (Partially)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nTo address excessive ZooKeeper reads caused by task framework CurrentState updates, it is proposed to move task framework CurrentStates to their separate path. \r\n\r\nThe change is divided to multiple phases. This is the first phase, where the main focus of the changes are on the controller side. These changes should be backward compatible, and should not break anything even without further changes on participant sides\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1250, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5,108.977 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1250, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:25 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-12-01T12:14:17-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-24T19:00:00Z","updated_at":"2020-12-08T22:31:13Z","closed_at":"2020-12-08T22:31:13Z","merged_at":"2020-12-08T22:31:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"31d522be812385ffabf454c8cd39197d88a3ff26","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1550/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1550/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1550/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/d01094c85614b3f8c2a7f5c00593bea109a1df56","head":{"label":"NealSun96:nealsun/task-current-state-moving","ref":"nealsun/task-current-state-moving","sha":"d01094c85614b3f8c2a7f5c00593bea109a1df56","user":{"login":"NealSun96","id":18000949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAwOTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18000949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96","html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":233725825,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzM3MjU4MjU=","name":"helix","full_name":"NealSun96/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NealSun96","id":18000949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAwOTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18000949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96","html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1479\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIt was discovered that even though there was a routing data change, _byteArrayZkClient was not being created anew using the newly read routing data. This would cause issues with the zookeeper endpoints provided through Helix REST. This change cleans up some internal methods and ensures that the byte array zk client gets nullified every time there is routing data change.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the code was closing byteArrayDataAccessor but not byteArrayZkClient. This meant that the same byteArrayZkClient would be used even though everything was reset and routing data was updated. Hence, the data accessor was not really being created from scratch. This change makes sure that the underlying byteArrayZkClient gets closed and nullified upon routing data change.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n`TestRoutingDataUpdate`\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 171, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 201.923 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 171, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  03:26 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-11-12T15:00:27-08:00\r\n[INFO] -----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1525 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIf a node has many children and the packet length exceeds the network buffer limit, the ZkClient's getChildren operation will fail. There are some cases that users will expect to fetch all the children successfully. Pagination could be used to support this feature. It requires the native zk to have the paginated getChildren API.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses reflection to determine whether or not getChildren should use the native zk pagination api.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n1. Add a system property config: **zk.getChildren.pagination.disabled**:\r\n  - if **false**, and when both zk client and server supports pagination, then the **paginated** api is called.\r\n  - If **true**, helix zkClient will force to call **non-paginated** api.\r\n2. Use reflection to get the method for getting children.\r\n3. Handle exceptions thrown from reflection invoking so ZkClient can handle the exception accordingly and maintains backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestZkConnection.testGetChildren\r\nTestZkConnection.testGetChildrenException\r\n\r\nSince Helix does not use the LinkedIn ZK by default, unit test is not added for testing the pagination in LinkedIn zk. But it's manually tested by changing the zk lib to LinkedIn zk and running all helix tests.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nhelix-core\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1237, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5,147.408 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1237, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:25 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-12-17T19:13:28-08:00\r\n```\r\n\r\nzookeeper-api\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 52, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 65.804 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 52, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:10 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-12-17T17:45:46-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nWorkaround for #1512 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThere is a race condition between TaskExecutor thread pool shutting down and Message handler stops listening.\r\nIn this gap, the message will still be processed but the schedule will fail.\r\nIf we mark partition into an ERROR state, then the controller side logic might be confused.\r\nThis PR adds an additional check to avoid the unnecessary ERROR state.

The cache of known messages list in HelixTaskExecutor may not be updated correctly if a message is going to be retried.\r\n2. The retry count is not strictly followed in some conditions.\r\n3.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1506, #1507\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes 2 issues:\r\n1. Ondemand rebalance flooding after TF IS removal. This is caused by an old problem. A jobConfig can exist for the previous iterations of a workflow, but the job doesn't exist in the job DAG. Because of runtime DAG refresh logic, such a jobConfig will cause the runtime DAG to be refreshed every time the pipeline runs. A new runtime DAG causes all the jobs to be reprocessed, and during processing, the cleanup logic is run for every job that has already completed. Before IS removal, the cleanup logic attempts to delete the IS again, which has no effect; in the new code, an onDemand rebalance is triggered instead. \r\nThis \"dangling job\" will not be removed, so the job dag refresh keeps on happening, which causes the ondemand rebalances to keep on firing. \r\n2. Log flooding for jobs that miss target resources after TF IS removal. Similarly, \"dangling jobs\" can have missing target resources once their target resources are deleted. Before IS removal, this is not a problem because this log is only triggered when the job is first processed; now, the processing logic happens every pipeline (since it's config based, instead of IS based), so the log could keep on firing. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1237, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 4,907.142 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1237, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:21 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-11-03T13:22:54-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-03T03:45:12Z","updated_at":"2020-11-04T17:44:09Z","closed_at":"2020-11-04T17:44:09Z","merged_at":"2020-11-04T17:44:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"ec214b2e809c6895382019243007e0167680502b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1508/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1508/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1508/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/8e14f0106b3fd2ca7453af177a1b7af093ed5482","head":{"label":"NealSun96:nealsun/fix-ondemand-and-log-flooding","ref":"nealsun/fix-ondemand-and-log-flooding","sha":"8e14f0106b3fd2ca7453af177a1b7af093ed5482","user":{"login":"NealSun96","id":18000949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAwOTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18000949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96","html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":233725825,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzM3MjU4MjU=","name":"helix","full_name":"NealSun96/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NealSun96","id":18000949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAwOTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18000949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96","html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n#1503  \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nDuring code inspection, We found there are multiple subscribeForChanges being called in CallBackHandler.handelChildChange. This leads to longer time spend when process callbacks in zkClient, witch eventually leads to increased PendingCallback queue size.\r\nThis PR removes duplicate subscribeForChanges in CallBackHandler to improve performance.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1244, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5,043.226 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1244, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:24 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-11-04T14:47:44-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-02T21:23:41Z","updated_at":"2020-11-09T22:06:54Z","closed_at":"2020-11-09T19:50:29Z","merged_at":"2020-11-09T19:50:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"11fa63ae3039cbf2dc56ca1c9596e8379751db0c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1504/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1504/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1504/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/ce0b61d062b3b01a370097aa5b5cf6ef38e90e78","head":{"label":"xyuanlu:callBackHandler","ref":"callBackHandler","sha":"ce0b61d062b3b01a370097aa5b5cf6ef38e90e78","user":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260321741,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAzMjE3NDE=","name":"helix","full_name":"xyuanlu/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolve #1488 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR enhances the message event processing logic to prevent silent failure and unnecessary retry.\r\n1. If creating a message handler fails unexpectedly (meaning there is an Exception), then the message will be marked as UNPROCESSABLE unless the message is sent with a retry count larger than 0. When the retry count is configured, then before the message runs out of the retry count, the participant will keep retrying on any message callbacks.\r\n2. The UNPROCESSABLE message, which is generated due to the previous point, will be left in the participant message folder and not automatically removed. This is to prevent unnecessary retry.\r\n3. If the message handler fails due to the participant cannot schedule the task, then the message will be discarded. If the message is a state transition message, then the corresponding state model and the partition current state will be set to ERROR. This is also to prevent unnecessary retry.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestHelixTaskExecutor\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[WARNING] Tests run: 1237, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  02:00 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-10-29T22:59:19-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nHelix plan to have the function to allow users to purge offline participants that have been timed out. This PR provides both Java API and REST API for users to purge offline participants. Users may specify the timeout through API input or just fall back to the default value defined in cluster config. If either is defined as a timeout, Helix will not purge participants.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestZkHelixAdmin\r\nTestClusterAccessor\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nhelix-core:\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1237, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 4,878.091 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1237, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:21 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-11-01T17:40:42-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nhelix-rest:\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 171, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 181.257 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 171, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  03:05 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-11-01T16:49:19-08:00\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n    fix #1486\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n    Improve statusUpdateUtil log error to ZK by adding an option to enabled\r\n    it. By default, it would not log error to ZK. This is to avoid some\r\n    error code path that keep flooding ZK sever which cause DoS to Zk.\r\n    Such as HelixTaskExecutor onMessage creation messageHandler exception.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n  TestStatusUpdateUtil\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\ngithub passed.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/runs/1344486165?check_suite_focus=true\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-22T00:13:25Z","updated_at":"2020-10-22T04:09:00Z","closed_at":"2020-10-22T04:08:59Z","merged_at":"2020-10-22T04:08:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"acaf13fbfa37a3bd5a80d32cd15d90057ae342b6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1480/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1480/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1480/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/6cf2d658500db87c6847e57d98eeaa6cad79ef19","head":{"label":"narendly:multiRest","ref":"multiRest","sha":"6cf2d658500db87c6847e57d98eeaa6cad79ef19","user":{"login":"narendly","id":10107095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTA3MDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10107095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly","html_url":"https://github.com/narendly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":126890023,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjY4OTAwMjM=","name":"helix","full_name":"narendly/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"narendly","id":10107095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTA3MDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10107095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly","html_url":"https://github.com/narendly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/narendly/helix","description":"Mirror
