The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nCurrently `FileSourceScanExec` has no relevant metirc about how many bytes of data are actually read, as a result, the actual output of `scanByte` metric of kylin query is the total source file size scanned, rather than the actual read data size. So I think a metric like this should be added to `KylinFileSourceScanExec`.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-07T03:23:09Z","updated_at":"2022-03-09T02:19:01Z","closed_at":"2022-03-09T02:19:01Z","merged_at":"2022-03-09T02:19:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"273fae822e4ce7e7c7434c4d1fccadb5bb9db719","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1825/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1825/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1825/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/8bea1460002d48946250e2f3175c49610873caf4","head":{"label":"zhangayqian:main","ref":"main","sha":"8bea1460002d48946250e2f3175c49610873caf4","user":{"login":"zhangayqian","id":31064237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDY0MjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31064237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangayqian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":194651853,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTQ2NTE4NTM=","name":"kylin","full_name":"zhangayqian/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhangayqian","id":31064237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDY0MjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31064237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangayqian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhangayqian/kylin","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-01T08:40:53Z","updated_at":"2022-03-01T08:44:50Z","closed_at":"2022-03-01T08:44:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"38aa4f5555756da6e47cbebf16c73e9a29bfa61a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1824/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1824/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1824/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/a9a08133cd6ffdc7b5d05162475f17d3b9e7470b","head":{"label":"zhenfuxu:i18n","ref":"i18n","sha":"a9a08133cd6ffdc7b5d05162475f17d3b9e7470b","user":{"login":"zhenfuxu","id":6970310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NzAzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6970310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenfuxu","html_url":"https://github.com/zhenfuxu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenfuxu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenfuxu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenfuxu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenfuxu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenfuxu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenfuxu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenfuxu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenfuxu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenfuxu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":464759169,"node_id":"R_kgDOG7OpgQ","name":"kylin","full_name":"zhenfuxu/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhenfuxu","id":6970310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NzAzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6970310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenfuxu","html_url":"https://github.com/zhenfuxu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenfuxu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenfuxu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenfuxu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenfuxu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenfuxu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenfuxu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenfuxu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenfuxu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenfuxu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhenfuxu/kylin","description":"Apache

The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-27T10:33:08Z","updated_at":"2023-12-05T12:46:24Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3d8e5cf1a238061ec480261bb027829d03ce1917","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1822/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1822/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1822/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/66c4329a3680f86be0187b853a1e9990b82e5c85","head":{"label":"sleep1661:KYLIN-5163","ref":"KYLIN-5163","sha":"66c4329a3680f86be0187b853a1e9990b82e5c85","user":{"login":"sleep1661","id":8802096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MDIwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8802096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661","html_url":"https://github.com/sleep1661","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":424810713,"node_id":"R_kgDOGVIY2Q","name":"kylin","full_name":"sleep1661/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sleep1661","id":8802096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MDIwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8802096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661","html_url":"https://github.com/sleep1661","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sleep1661/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sleep1661/kylin","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-24T07:31:14Z","updated_at":"2022-02-25T01:50:21Z","closed_at":"2022-02-25T01:50:21Z","merged_at":"2022-02-25T01:50:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"121a8a1d9fadf988a45029caf39c6249a95d5ba9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1820/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1820/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1820/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/e76d00992270ee23f17a0593f7d87215f861ac45","head":{"label":"zhangayqian:main","ref":"main","sha":"e76d00992270ee23f17a0593f7d87215f861ac45","user":{"login":"zhangayqian","id":31064237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDY0MjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31064237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangayqian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":194651853,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTQ2NTE4NTM=","name":"kylin","full_name":"zhangayqian/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhangayqian","id":31064237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDY0MjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31064237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangayqian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhangayqian/kylin","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-17T07:49:17Z","updated_at":"2022-03-09T02:22:39Z","closed_at":"2022-03-09T02:22:39Z","merged_at":"2022-03-09T02:22:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"c29b8f5b5ffa4d33ea2120a4efe261a6fbab1b01","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1819/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1819/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1819/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/2a62b380c74b262075e2fba1fd6f9de8011befb5","head":{"label":"hit-lacus:KYLIN-5160","ref":"KYLIN-5160","sha":"2a62b380c74b262075e2fba1fd6f9de8011befb5","user":{"login":"hit-lacus","id":14030549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDMwNTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14030549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus","html_url":"https://github.com/hit-lacus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":149539687,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDk1Mzk2ODc=","name":"kylin","full_name":"hit-lacus/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hit-lacus","id":14030549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDMwNTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14030549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus","html_url":"https://github.com/hit-lacus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hit-lacus/kylin","description":"Kylin

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nfix[ KYLIN-4382](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN-4382) Unable to use DATE type in prepared statements\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [x] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-08T12:45:47Z","updated_at":"2022-02-09T03:50:15Z","closed_at":"2022-02-09T03:49:22Z","merged_at":"2022-02-09T03:49:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"ba760d52ac02e272e7768cab58c6c91f0008a030","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1813/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1813/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1813/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/598154d77b48567f0230d0e11bc52d7a3a1011cd","head":{"label":"juntaozhang:kylin-4382-kylin3","ref":"kylin-4382-kylin3","sha":"598154d77b48567f0230d0e11bc52d7a3a1011cd","user":{"login":"juntaozhang","id":7509285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MDkyODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7509285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntaozhang","html_url":"https://github.com/juntaozhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntaozhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntaozhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntaozhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntaozhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntaozhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntaozhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntaozhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntaozhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntaozhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":453264670,"node_id":"R_kgDOGwRFHg","name":"kylin","full_name":"juntaozhang/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juntaozhang","id":7509285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MDkyODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7509285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntaozhang","html_url":"https://github.com/juntaozhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntaozhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntaozhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntaozhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntaozhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntaozhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntaozhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntaozhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntaozhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juntaozhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juntaozhang/kylin","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-08T10:21:53Z","updated_at":"2022-02-11T04:03:08Z","closed_at":"2022-02-11T04:03:07Z","merged_at":"2022-02-11T04:03:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"7e59491b870c473631566b674e082ffb4ecc0442","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1812/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1812/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1812/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/2db21ff86d1875a5ba949b608f768d41caf0bf9b","head":{"label":"Mukvin:fix-0208","ref":"fix-0208","sha":"2db21ff86d1875a5ba949b608f768d41caf0bf9b","user":{"login":"Mukvin","id":34978943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTc4OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34978943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260150182,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAxNTAxODI=","name":"kylin","full_name":"Mukvin/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Mukvin","id":34978943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTc4OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34978943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin/kylin","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-08T10:02:06Z","updated_at":"2022-02-11T08:15:56Z","closed_at":"2022-02-11T08:15:56Z","merged_at":"2022-02-11T08:15:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"737f79edc0ef73ab780355f2a54f5898e5809ab3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1811/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1811/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1811/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/bd1b6028b8374d38e6968b7ee8b7c16213334bf0","head":{"label":"zhangayqian:fix","ref":"fix","sha":"bd1b6028b8374d38e6968b7ee8b7c16213334bf0","user":{"login":"zhangayqian","id":31064237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDY0MjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31064237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangayqian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":194651853,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTQ2NTE4NTM=","name":"kylin","full_name":"zhangayqian/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhangayqian","id":31064237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDY0MjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31064237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangayqian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhangayqian/kylin","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nupdate document\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [x] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nChange Volatile Range be 7 by default, which keep hot data of last 7 day not been merged.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [x] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [x] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThe parallelism of the current global dict bucket resizing job is not clear, which may result in too small parallelism and long time running in some case. So i think force one bucket one task will be better.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDescribe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The original branch _kylin-on-parquet-v2_ for **Kylin 4.X** (Parquet Storage) has been renamed to branch **main**, and configured as the **default** branch;\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-15T11:15:31Z","updated_at":"2021-09-18T05:50:36Z","closed_at":"2021-09-18T05:50:36Z","merged_at":"2021-09-18T05:50:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"77526b253ad12e1c6f93520244a187f161e1638a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1748/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1748/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1748/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/a7a525988ffb5efbad201624f2c7b04e4692ebca","head":{"label":"zhangayqian:KYLIN-5076","ref":"KYLIN-5076","sha":"a7a525988ffb5efbad201624f2c7b04e4692ebca","user":{"login":"zhangayqian","id":31064237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDY0MjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31064237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangayqian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":194651853,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTQ2NTE4NTM=","name":"kylin","full_name":"zhangayqian/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhangayqian","id":31064237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDY0MjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31064237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangayqian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangayqian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhangayqian/kylin","description":"Apache

The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.X** (HBase Storage) has been renamed to branch **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-09T02:35:29Z","updated_at":"2024-09-24T23:25:22Z","closed_at":"2021-09-18T05:56:05Z","merged_at":"2021-09-18T05:56:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"93671dfb0a2d3d21025e1dbf1e872daf0e217cc5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1745/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1745/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1745/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/01957817b54175eb8727793144b7a4df89cf766d","head":{"label":"Mukvin:KYLIN-5086","ref":"KYLIN-5086","sha":"01957817b54175eb8727793144b7a4df89cf766d","user":{"login":"Mukvin","id":34978943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTc4OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34978943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260150182,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAxNTAxODI=","name":"kylin","full_name":"Mukvin/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Mukvin","id":34978943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTc4OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34978943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin/kylin","description":"Apache
