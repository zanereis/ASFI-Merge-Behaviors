The current code for doing this has several problems, however. One is that it tends to trigger even in cases where we don't actually need it. Another is that when re-registering the broker, the broker is marked as fenced.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the handling of the re-registration case out of BrokerMetadataPublisher and into BrokerRegistrationTracker. The re-registration code there will only trigger in the case where the broker sees an existing registration for itself with no directories set.  This is much more targetted than the original code.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in ClusterControlManager, when re-registering the same broker, we now preserve its fencing and shutdown state, rather than clearing those. (There isn't any good reason re-registering the same broker should clear these things... this was purely an oversight.) Note that we can tell the broker is \"the same\" because it has the same IncarnationId.","created_at":"2024-05-13T23:19:20Z","updated_at":"2024-06-01T22:51:39Z","closed_at":"2024-06-01T22:51:39Z","merged_at":"2024-06-01T22:51:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"8ace33b47fc078d89a104043b12ca95f6e1da637","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15945/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15945/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/15945/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/0410201bc0f04145c4a86d8a23b08350cc756ae6","head":{"label":"cmccabe:KAFKA-16757","ref":"KAFKA-16757","sha":"0410201bc0f04145c4a86d8a23b08350cc756ae6","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

change to how the describe topic output is parsed in system tests, to ensure that the output is preserved, even if only some fields are relevant to the test for now (which is what the test used to do before recent changes)\r\n\r\nInitial problem: System tests were parsing the describe topic output in kafka.py assuming all fields would include a value. The describe API was recently changed, breaking this logic, because it included new fields for which there may not be values (ex. LastKnownElr). \r\n\r\nInitial fix: The initial fix for this was to drop all fields from the output except for the ones currently used in the test, where in reality only the fields without values are the problematic ones. \r\n\r\nProposed improvement: A more extensible approach would be to drop only the fields that have no values and preserve the full output, which is what the test did before the initial fix mentioned above. This allows to easily extend the test to include more fields as needed, which could follow as the describe API and tests evolves (it will only require to add the fields to the returned value when needed, without having to change how the `fields` object is stripped).

to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16738\r\n\r\nWe can write a record which is a subtype of [BaseRecords](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/record/BaseRecords.java), but we can not read a record which is a subtype of [BaseRecords](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/record/BaseRecords.java). If we change the return type of [Readable#readRecords](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/5439914c32fa00d634efa7219699f1bc21add839/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/protocol/Readable.java#L56) from MemoryRecords to BaseRecords, we can override the implementation of readRecords and returns a subtype of BaseRecords easily.\r\n\r\nWe known that the MemoryRecords is based on JDK's ByteBuffer. We are developing a netty project([kroxylicious](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/)) and we want to create a subtype of BaseRecords like MemoryRecords based on netty's ByteBuf.\r\n\r\n###

described from [kafka-16710](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16710):\r\nThe scenario where this case occurs is during a reassignment of a partition: 110879, 110880 (original leader, original follower) ---> 110879, 110880, 110881, 113915 (the latter two replicas are new leader and new follower) ---> 110881, 113915 (new leader, new follower). The \"Offset mismatch\" exception occurs on the new follower 113915.\r\n\r\nThrough analysis, the exception occurs in the reassignment process:\r\n\r\n1. After the new replicas 110881, 113915 are fully enqueued into the ISR, the controller will switch the leader from 110879 to 110881, and then send a new `leaderAndIsr` (leader is 110881, ISR is 110879, 110880, 110881, 113915) to 110881, 113915.\r\n2. This time, 110881 executes `makeLeader`, and 113915 executes `makeFollower`. After the new follower 113915 completes `removeFetcherForPartitions` and `addFetcherForPartitions`, it starts fetching data from the new leader 110881, but because the log end offset of the new leader 110881 (18735600055) is smaller than the log end offset of the new follower 113915 (18735600059), the new follower 113915 adds the partition to `divergingEndOffsets` during `processFetchRequest` and then executes `truncateOnFetchResponse` to truncate the local log to 18735600055.\r\n3. However, unfortunately, `truncateOnFetchResponse` needs to acquire the `partitionMapLock` lock, and at the same time, the new leader 110881 and the new follower 113915 also receive another `leaderAndIsr` request from the controller (to remove the old replicas 110879, 110880 from the ISR), and the `ReplicaFetcherManager` thread of the new follower 113915 executes the second `makeFollower` to acquire the `partitionMapLock` lock firstly and execute `removeFetcherForPartitions`, and then gets the local log end offset (18735600059) as the fetch offset, ready to execute `addFetcherForPartitions` again to update the fetch offset (18735600059) to the `partitionStates`.\r\n4. But unfortunately, the follower fetcher thread that was ready to truncate the local log to 18735600055 firstly obtained the `partitionMapLock` lock and completed the truncation, and the log end offset is now 18735600055.\r\n5. Then, the thread that executed the second `makeFollower` obtained the `partitionMapLock` lock and executed `addFetcherForPartitions` to update the outdated fetch offset (18735600059) to the `partitionStates`.\r\n6. Finally, it leads to: the follower thread throws the following exception during `processPartitionData`: \"java.lang.IllegalStateException: Offset mismatch for partition aiops-adplatform-interfacelog-191: fetched offset = 18735600059, log end offset = 18735600055.\"\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nMove `truncateOnFetchResponse` to the range of `partitionMapLock` in replica fetcher thread.","created_at":"2024-05-13T10:21:52Z","updated_at":"2025-01-05T03:39:11Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ae1f9a6907f34134a30c7930c5734069807aa79d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chia7712","id":6234750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzQ3NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6234750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712","html_url":"https://github.com/chia7712","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

Motivation\r\n- `QuorumController` warn with \"Performing controller activation. Loaded ZK migration state of NONE\" even if it's `de-novo` KRaft cluster. That message makes operator confused, and operator might waste time investigating that log. If we add some description to log, operator will be more convenient. \r\n\r\n### Modification\r\n- Add a log for `de-novo KRaft ` cluster when `zookeeper.metadata.migration.enable=false` and the broker version supports `KRaft`.\r\n\r\n### Result\r\n- Fixes

becoming the active KRaftMigrationDriver, there is another race condition similar to KAFKA-16171. This time, the race is due to a stale read from ZK. After writing to `/controller` and `/controller_epoch`, it is possible that a read on `/migration` is not linear with the writes that were just made. In other words, we get a stale read on `/migration`. This leads to an inability to sync metadata to ZK due to incorrect zkVersion on the migration Znode. \r\n\r\nThe non-linearizability of reads is in fact documented behavior for ZK, so we need to handle it.\r\n\r\nTo fix the stale read, this patch adds a write to `/migration` after updating `/controller` and `/controller_epoch`. This allows us to learn the correct zkVersion for the migration ZNode before leaving the BECOME_CONTROLLER state.\r\n\r\nThis patch also adds a check on the current leader epoch when running certain events in KRaftMigrationDriver. Historically, we did not include this check because it is not necessary for correctness. Writes to ZK are gated on the  `/controller_epoch` zkVersion, and RPCs sent to brokers are gated on the controller epoch. However, during a time of rapid failover, there is a lot of processing happening on the controller (i.e., full metadata sync to ZK and full UMRs sent to brokers), so it is best to avoid running events we know will fail.\r\n\r\nThere is also a small fix in here to improve the logging of ZK operations. The log message are changed to past tense to reflect the fact that they have already happened by the time the log message is

a short discussion with Sophie Blee-Goldman (see https://lists.apache.org/thread/x4szs4szq0gq1twrpdv0fppzr92rr623), I dived into a few days of debugging and testing with a network connection that can deliberately switched to drop all packages. As I also work with Spring sometimes, I finally looked up how Spring Kafka does the exception handling and came up with quite a simple solution that at least works very well with my test scenarios: I used all the default timeouts for the configuration of the producer and tested with network outages (packages are dropped) of 20 seconds, 45 seconds and 75 seconds.\r\n\r\nWhile transforming my production code back into a code sample, I changed it from catching general Exceptions to catching KafkaExceptions, because Sophie mentioned she doesn't like general Exceptions to be caught.\r\n\r\nPlease consider this PR as a request for comments, as I am rather new to Kafka and I didn't quite understand all the details of the original code sample.","created_at":"2024-05-08T18:25:02Z","updated_at":"2025-01-05T03:39:08Z","closed_at":"2025-01-05T03:39:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7da6299dfc58f0c6da73b46f5f5d71c6fff8c3c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

IncrementalCooperativeAssignor in Connect, during `performTaskAssignment`, there is a step where it finds the newly created connectors and tasks

However, the name of the variable is incorrect because any connectors and tasks revoked in the previous round would also be reflecting here. This is easy to validate with the test `IncrementalCooperativeAssignorTest$testTaskAssignmentWhenWorkerJoins` and setting a debugger on the above line after the rebalance that happens [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/2a5efe4a334611fc7c15f76b322482bad0942db0/connect/runtime/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/distributed/IncrementalCooperativeAssignorTest.java#L115). We can see that the set would be non empty as it contains the revoked connectors and tasks from the previous round after a second worker joined.\r\n\r\nI have updated the variable's name to `unassigned` as it reflects all the unassigned connectors and tasks in this round (newly created and revoked in previous rounds).

reports value in the form of `sumOrCount`/`monitoredWindowSize`. It has a bug in `monitoredWindowSize` calculation, which leads to spikes in result values (see real example: `io-wait-ratio` has ~100% -> ~50% spikes):\r\n<img width=\"1119\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-07 at 10 10 33 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/kafka/assets/135832807/24800c04-b754-4c60-891d-5174823890dd\">\r\n\r\nMonitored window consists of several samples (see [SampledStat](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/metrics/stats/SampledStat.java) for ref). Sample ends after a fixed time following the first event. New sample starts by the next event after prev sample end. There is always some gap between samples, while no event is recorded. \r\n\r\nBefore reporting value, `Rate` purges (`sumOrCount := 0`) all samples, **started** before the monitored window (but can still overlap it). This purging is only reflected in numerator. Denominator is always the entire monitored window.\r\n\r\nConsider the picture, corresponding to default config (`numWindows = 2`):\r\n<img width=\"932\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-07 at 9 48 26 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/kafka/assets/135832807/b5d2bebb-b158-4489-a490-0910c5c460f4\">\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen measurement is requested at the end of right sample, the left sample is purged for numerator, but not for denominator. It is the reason for spikes on the chart above: when we move to such zone, numerator is reduced by 2 times, while denominator remains the same.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes such behavior. Now samples are not purged if they overlap the monitored window, even if started before.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [

change adds the possibility to suppress events during windowing based on WALL_CLOCK_TIME instead of STREAM_CLOCK_TIME. \r\n\r\n**Problem Statement**:\r\nIn our use case we needed this functionality, as the amount of events varies very much. Sometimes we get so few events, that the event won't be emitted at all unless a new event comes in to advance STREAM_CLOCK_TIME.\r\n\r\n**Solution**:\r\nWe implemented a new possibility to use WALL_CLOCK_TIME instead of STREAM_CLOCK_TIME for suppression during windowing. It is based on a scheduled operation and punctuates the clock on each interval.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Testing**:\r\nFor testing we extended the `streams/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/internals/SuppressScenarioTest.java` with a new scenario where the suppression is based on wall clock time.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

KRaft replicas to read and write version 0 and 1 of the quorum-state file. Which version is written is controlled by the kraft.version. With kraft.version 0, version 0 of the quorum-state file is written. With kraft.version 1, version 1 of the quorum-state file is written. Version 1 of the quorum-state file adds the VotedDirectoryId field and removes the CurrentVoters. The other fields removed in version 1 are not important as they were not overwritten or used by KRaft.\r\n\r\nIn kraft.version 1 the set of voters will be stored in the kraft partition log segments and snapshots.\r\n\r\nTo implement this feature the following changes were made to KRaft.\r\n\r\nFileBasedStateStore was renamed to FileQuorumStateStore to better match the name of the implemented interface QuorumStateStore.\r\n\r\nThe QuorumStateStore::writeElectionState was extended to include the kraft.version. This version is used to determine which version of QuorumStateData to store. When writing version 0 the VotedDirectoryId is not persisted but the latest value is kept in-memory. This allows the replica to vote consistently while they stay online. If a replica restarts in the middle of an election it will forget the VotedDirectoryId if the kraft.version is 0. This should be rare in practice and should only happen if there is an election and failure while the system is upgrading to kraft.version 1.\r\n\r\nThe type ElectionState, the interface EpochState and all of the implementations of EpochState (VotedState, UnattachedState, FollowerState, ResignedState, CandidateState and LeaderState) are extended to support the new voted directory id.\r\n\r\nThe type QuorumState is changed so that local directory id is used. The type is also changed so that the latest value for the set of voters and the kraft version is query from the KRaftControlRecordStateMachine.\r\n\r\nThe replica directory id is read from the meta.properties and passed to the KafkaRaftClient. The replica directory id is guaranteed to be set in the local replica.\r\n\r\nAdds a new metric for current-vote-directory-id which exposes the latest in-memory value of the voted directory id.\r\n\r\nRenames VoterSet.VoterKey to ReplicaKey.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that after this change, version 1 of the quorum-state file will not be written by kraft controllers and brokers. This change adds support reading and writing version 1 of the file in preparation for future changes.","created_at":"2024-05-04T20:49:16Z","updated_at":"2024-05-16T15:54:24Z","closed_at":"2024-05-16T13:53:36Z","merged_at":"2024-05-16T13:53:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"056d232f4e28bf8e67e00f8ed2c103fdb0f3b78e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6787634831,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABlJMWjw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-853","name":"KIP-853","color":"D00CA6","default":false,"description":"KRaft

The fix here only allows to initialize the newly assigned partition position, and keeps the existing logic for making sure that the partition remains non-fetchable until the callback completes.\r\n\r\nThe need for this fix came out in one of the connect system tests, that attempts to retrieve a newly assigned partition position with a call to consumer.position from within the onPartitionsAssigned callback ([WorkerSinkTask](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/2c0b8b692071b6d436fa7e9dc90a1592476a6b17/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/WorkerSinkTask.java#L715)).
