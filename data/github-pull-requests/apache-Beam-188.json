I also provide overloaded methods which allow to name the corresponding nodes in the graph.\r\n\r\nThe background of this change is that currently it is not possible to have multiple joins in the same pipeline without wrapping them in individual PTransforms as this would generate name clashes.\r\n\r\nConsider the following test case:\r\n\r\n```\r\n @Test\r\n  public void testMultipleJoinsInSamePipeline() {\r\n    leftListOfKv.add(KV.of(\"Key2\", 4L));\r\n    PCollection<KV<String, Long>> leftCollection = p.apply(\"CreateLeft\", Create.of(leftListOfKv));\r\n\r\n    rightListOfKv.add(KV.of(\"Key2\", \"bar\"));\r\n    PCollection<KV<String, String>> rightCollection =\r\n            p.apply(\"CreateRight\", Create.of(rightListOfKv));\r\n\r\n    expectedResult.add(KV.of(\"Key2\", KV.of(4L, \"bar\")));\r\n\r\n    PCollection<KV<String, KV<Long, String>>> output1 =\r\n            Join.innerJoin(leftCollection, rightCollection);\r\n    PCollection<KV<String, KV<Long, String>>> output2 =\r\n            Join.innerJoin(leftCollection, rightCollection);\r\n    PAssert.that(output1).containsInAnyOrder(expectedResult);\r\n    PAssert.that(output2).containsInAnyOrder(expectedResult);\r\n\r\n    p.run();\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the change contained in this PR, the same code would still fail but there is now an overloaded call to `Join.innerJoin` so that the corresponding nodes in the execution graph receive different names (see test case below).\r\n\r\nThe change is backwards compatible. Two other side benefits are:\r\n\r\n * The naming of the transformation is slightly more intuitive in case you want to debug / look at the execution graph it's now easier  to see which steps correspond to the join.\r\n * It also allows using the `PTransform` directly writing something like `myCollection1.apply(InnerJoin.with(myCollection2))` which some people might find more intuitive.\r\n\r\n * [x]  [**Choose reviewer(s)**](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/#make-your-change) and mention them in a comment (`R: @username`).\r\n * [x]  Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\r\n * [ ]  If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

as keys than the native go runtime approach for interfaces{}, as the runtime uses a better hash function. \r\nGeneral struct performance (for values Go supported as keys) will be much slower than the go runtime.\r\nPointer elements (with coders) used as keys will be slower, but they'll also be correct, which wasn't the case previously.\r\nCare needs to be taken using Maps in Key values, as the Go SDK does not presently sort maps in any fashion prior to encoding. Combined with go map's random iteration order, means combines with such keys will not be valid.\r\n\r\nA separate in PR will add vetting for this case, to discourage the use of map fields in key types.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

checkpointing does not work correctly when FlinkKeyGroupStateInternals are used, i.e. when the DoFn uses keyed KV input. Any elements emitted during finalizeBundle() will not be checkpointed.\r\n\r\nThe test demonstrates the desired behavior. Trying to fix this across Flink 1.5 - 1.7 is a bit tricky due to the different way the timer state is treated. The fix in `DoFnOperator` only works for 1.5.\r\n\r\n@aljoscha Perhaps you can give some input on this? Couldn't we use Flink's keyed operator state for the buffer output?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

Harshit Dwivedi <harshithdwivedi@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nHi @kennknowles, as discussed in the [Jira ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-6493), I've added the Kotlin Sample for WordCount in the example folder.\r\nPlease have a look and let me know if the project structure looks good, if it does, I'll go ahead and refactor rest of the projects.\r\n\r\nHere's what I had in mind for the structure : \r\n\r\n```\r\nexamples\r\n    -java/src/main/org/apache/beam/examples\r\n        -java (all the java samples go in this folder)\r\n        -kotlin (all the kotlin samples go in this folder)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

adds support for \"done\" notification in `BigtableIO.write()`. For each bundle+window that is written, a single \"Void\" is output by the PTransform. Doing so allows flows to effectively wait for all writes to finish.  Note that windowing is preserved, and pipeline writers can choose to deal with early firings, etc as they desire. A common use-case of this is to wait for all writes to finish, and then do something else, this can be accomplished using the built-in `Wait.on` transform with the output of the write, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval writeResults = mutations.apply(\r\n  \"WriteToBigtable\",\r\n  BigtableIO.write()...\r\n)\r\n\r\nval collectionToProcessAfterWrites = Create.of(\"derp\")\r\ncollectionToProcessAfterWrites\r\n  .apply(Wait.on(writeResults))\r\n  .apply(ParDo.of(someFn))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn important point to note here is this only ensures writes have been applied **to a single cluster**, it does not ensure that all writes **have replicated to all clusters**.\r\n\r\nI had also made a previous PR a few months ago (https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3997), this is an enhancement of that.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

wraps inner coders in a NullableCoder if the inner type of an array or value type of a map is nullable.\r\n\r\nI fixed this slightly differently than was suggested in the JIRA issue. Instead of adding it for both `mapCoder` and `listCoder`, I wrap the coder in `getCoder`. This makes more sense to me as nullability is (as of recently) a property of the FieldType itself. I also deprecated the nullable array and map methods that @kennknowles considered a usability bug.\r\n\r\nI also moved the RowCoder tests. They were in a weird location that did not seem like it was on purpose.\r\n\r\nR: @reuvenlax\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

Two tests are added to this suite in this change: wordcount batch and wordcount batch on FnAPI.\r\n- Rename task `precommitIT` to `preCommitIT` for consistency.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\nIt will help us expedite review of your Pull Request if you tag someone (e.g. `@username`) to look at it.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status

PR does the following:\r\n- replaces the mock by an embedded cassandra instance in UTests\r\n- refactors CassandraIO: remove CassandraService (which main justification was for injecting the mock), various code simplifications\r\n- add new tests: testSplit\r\n- fixes a bug in split in the production code (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-6591) discovered with the addition of the missing testSplit.\r\n- Fixes all the tests.\r\n\r\nI have already squashed history to isolable commits for both ease the review of the refactoring and allow an easy rollback of the refactoring if need. I think the history should not be squashed more.\r\n\r\nR: @adejanovski \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

[BEAM-6608] Prepare to-be-staged files early enough in Flink Runner \r\n\r\nBefore execution, the Flink Runner prepares all necessary files, in order for\r\nthem to be shipped to the remote cluster.\r\n\r\nDue to a recent regression via BEAM-2873, the preparation is performed after the\r\nexecution environment has been initialized. This skips the preparation phase and\r\nresults in invalid files being shipped.\r\n\r\n#### [BEAM-6609] Default tempLocation in FlinkPipelineOptions to default tmp directory\r\n\r\nIncludes this second commit because it is an easy fix and works on the same files. There should be a sensible default, so users don't have to configure the temp path by default.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

attempted in #6586, this new PR incorporates feedback from the previous\r\nreview and provides some additional convenience. The most important change\r\nis that the interface now expects users to provide an exception handler\r\nfunction that outputs elements that are efficiently codable as originally\r\nsuggested by @tims.\r\n\r\nCommon features have been implemented in a new `WithExceptions` class,\r\nand the top-level documentation there is the best place to look for an overview\r\nof the approach here.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not address Filter, AsJsons, and ParseJsons. Those could be added\r\nin a future PR.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

PR does several interlocking things:\r\n* Expands FullType to accept maps, points & arrays as user types.\r\n  * Also adds interface types, but they will fail at construction time if the interface isn't registered.\r\n  * Adds tests for new permitted types, and recursive structs that they allow.\r\n* Increases the internal coder package test coverage.\r\n* BREAKING: No longer exporting beam.ProtoEnc, beam.ProtoDec, beam.JSONEnc, and beam.JSONDec. They shouldn't have been exported in the first place.\r\n* Adds basic coder registry support.\r\n   * Interface is subject to change. It might be worthwhile to add a \"name\" to various custom coders to permit them to be enabled/disabled at will. This would require other surface changes. A work around would be to define a new type `type newType oldType` if differential behavior is desired, and casting between the two as necessary.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: This doesn't yet permit using pointer, slice, map, or interface types as Key types. The Combiner code needs to be updated to encode key values before pre-combining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

an error an occurred in an operator chain, `dipose()` could be called\r\nmultiple times leading to duplicate calls to `invokeFinishBundle()`, some of\r\nwhich actions expect to release resources only once. Also, the bundle expiration\r\ntimer could call finish bundle simultaneously with `dipose()`.\r\n\r\nThis makes the finish bundle logic execute exactly once by making it\r\natomic. Note: This did not affect correctness of results but the change ensures\r\nthere are no duplicate cleanup calls.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

PR re-adds the gcio_test to the py3-gcp tox suite. This test was removed in #7691 due to being flaky.\r\n\r\nHowever, the problem here was not a flaky test, but that the test was included twice in the test suite (see [this comment](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/7691#issuecomment-459431122)).\r\nThe same mocked object is used twice, which resulted in the iterator being exhausted during the second test.\r\n\r\nIn [the logs](https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Python_Commit/4034/console) of one of the runs that flagged this test as flaky, we can see that the test passed the first time, and failed the second time.\r\n\r\n> 12:54:06 test_rename (apache_beam.io.gcp.gcsio_test.TestGCSIO) ... ok\r\n> ...\r\n> 12:54:06 test_rename (apache_beam.io.gcp.gcsio_test.TestGCSIO) ...
