is a continuation of https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/25922 and an attempt to fix an issue with Dataflow logging, when log messages sometimes get corrupted.\r\n\r\nDataflowWorkerLoggingHandler logs message to a physical file, then a separate process in Dataflow reads this file and exports logs to Cloud Logging.\r\n\r\nI found that the Jackson generator used by DataflowWorkerLoggingHandler has the SerializationFeature.FLUSH_AFTER_WRITE_VALUE feature enabled by default, which makes it flush the JSON output to the underlying stream after every object write. DataflowWorkerLoggingHandler currently writes the \"severity\" field as an object (generator.writeObjectField(\"severity\", ...))., which results in the log message being flushed between \"severity\" and \"message\" fields, and some time Dataflow logging infrastructure pick this up as 2 separate message (both unparsable as JSON, with broken formatting/wrong severity).\r\n\r\nDisabling SerializationFeature.FLUSH_AFTER_WRITE_VALUE should fix this issue (and improve logging performance a little bit).\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PerWorkerHistograms are in a Map that's keyed by `KV<MetricName, BucketType>`. After this change the map they're stored in will be Keyed by `MetricName`.\r\n\r\nComputing a hash/equality for the `KV` object is non-trivial and has a fair amount of overhead [src](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/values/KV.java#L124). Since we need to do a map lookup for the histogram metric every time we record a value, we can remove a lot of the overhead by simply using a map that's only Keyed by `MetricName`.\r\n\r\nThe first time a `Histogram` is requested for a `<Metric Name, Bucket Type>` we will use the `BucketType` to create the histogram object. Future requests for a `Histogram` for that `Metric Name` will return the original histogram object, regardless of what the future `Bucket Type` is. Since `Bucket Types` are statically defined, this change does not affect BigQuery Per Worker Metrics. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

rolls forward the Java SDK reference implementation of `Redistribute`. This does not include runner translations.\r\n\r\n - In the prior attempt at this change: many runners failed the Redistribute tests until a custom translation was inserted. I addressed it by adding custom translations that roughly matched Reshuffle.\r\n - In this attempt, I will focus first on getting all runners passing the tests as a composite, or sickbaying if the runner lacks core capabilities required by the tests. For example it looks like some / many runners may lose windowing metadata. I will add custom runner translations in later iterations.\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit f498cdfc2a84a49f0d5812e7dd0e55e08b214e4a.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

printing an <code>context canceled</code> spurious error when OTEL is configured. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/docker/cli/pull/5044\">docker/cli#5044</a></li>\n<li>Experimental environment variable <code>DOCKER_BRIDGE_PRESERVE_KERNEL_LL=1</code> will prevent the daemon from removing the kernel-assigned link local address on a Linux bridge. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47775\">moby/moby#47775</a></li>\n<li>Resolve an issue preventing container creation on hosts with a read-only <code>/proc/sys/net</code> filesystem. If IPv6 cannot be disabled on an interface due to this, either disable IPv6 by default on the host or ensure <code>/proc/sys/net</code> is read-write. Otherwise, start dockerd with <code>DOCKER_ALLOW_IPV6_ON_IPV4_INTERFACE=1</code> to bypass the error. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47769\">moby/moby#47769</a></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!NOTE]\nThe <code>DOCKER_ALLOW_IPV6_ON_IPV4_INTERFACE</code> is added as a temporary fix and will be phased out in a future major release after simplifying the IPv6 enablement process.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Packaging updates</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Update BuildKit to <a href=\"https://github.com/moby/buildkit/releases/tag/v0.13.2\">v0.13.2</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47762\">moby/moby#47762</a></li>\n<li>Update Compose to <a href=\"https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/v2.27.0\">v2.27.0</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/docker/docker-ce-packaging/pull/1017\">docker/docker-ce-packages#1017</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v26.1.0</h2>\n<h2>26.1.0</h2>\n<p>For a full list of pull requests and changes in this release, refer to the relevant GitHub milestones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/docker/cli/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A26.1.0\">docker/cli, 26.1.0 milestone</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/moby/moby/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A26.1.0\">moby/moby, 26.1.0 milestone</a></li>\n<li>Deprecated and removed features, see <a href=\"https://github.com/docker/cli/blob/v26.1.0/docs/deprecated.md\">Deprecated Features</a>.</li>\n<li>Changes to the Engine API, see <a href=\"https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/v26.1.0/docs/api/version-history.md\">API version history</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Add configurable OpenTelemetry utilities and basic instrumentation to commands.\nFor more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/config/otel\">OpenTelemetry for the Docker CLI</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/docker/cli/pull/4889\">docker/cli#4889</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug fixes and enhancements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Native Windows containers are configured with an internal DNS server for container name resolution, and external DNS servers for other lookups. Not all resolvers, including <code>nslookup</code>, fall back to the external resolvers when they get a <code>SERVFAIL</code> answer from the internal server. So, the internal DNS server can now be configured to forward requests to the external resolvers, by setting <code>&quot;features&quot;: {&quot;windows-dns-proxy&quot;: true }</code> in the <code>daemon.json</code> file. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47584\">moby/moby#47584</a></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!NOTE]\nThis will be the new default behavior in Docker Engine 27.0.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!WARNING]\nThe <code>windows-dns-proxy</code> feature flag will be removed in a future release.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Swarm: Fix <code>Subpath</code> not being passed to the container config. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47711\">moby/moby#47711</a></li>\n<li>Classic builder: Fix cache miss on <code>WORKDIR &lt;directory&gt;/</code> build step (directory with a trailing slash). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47723\">moby/moby#47723</a></li>\n<li>containerd image store: Fix <code>docker images</code> failing when any image in the store has unexpected target. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47738\">moby/moby#47738</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

PR automates [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/private-cluster-bastion) using a terraform module to provision a compute engine instance bastion host to act as a proxy to a private Kafka cluster. See README committed in this PR for description, prerequisites, requirements, and usage. The goal is so that the same Kafka cluster can be used for local development/testing as well as for remote usage in a pipeline such as Dataflow.\r\n\r\nEssentially, the solution creates a bastion host compute engine instance and outputs the gcloud command needed to tunnel traffic to the developer's local machine.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

`pyenv` is recommended for use in [beam's Python's Developer Guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BEAM/), it makes sense to include `.python-version` in the `.gitignore` file. It makes development with `pyenv` easier by automatically detecting the `venv` in the terminal when entering the beam's directory. Including this file in the `.gitignore` prevents accidental committing of this file.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\nRelated to : https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/31118\r\n\r\nUpon utilizing the Beam SQL within our pipeline, we encountered a noteworthy exception. It appears that when the input row encompasses fields of iterable types, the process fails irrespective of whether the iterable fields are included in the SQL filter condition or not. This issue stems from the fact that the Beam SQL extension attempts to construct an output row schema based on the input schema, and unfortunately, it currently lacks support for iterable types.\r\n\r\nConsider the following example:\r\n\r\nGiven an inputRow in the schema:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfield1: String\r\nfield2: Integer\r\nfield3: Array<String>\r\nfield4: ITERABLE\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd ANY  Beam SQL condition such as :\r\n`field2 > 1`\r\nor Even \r\n`1 = 1`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pipeline will invariably fail, yielding the following error: `Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Unable to get ITERABLE at org.apache.beam.sdk.extensions.sql.impl.rel.BeamCalcRel$InputGetterImpl.getBeamField(BeamCalcRel.java:603).`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(My first contribution to beam , kindly advise how to test lol)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

users to specify an alternate way to generate the table row for the error output for BQIO's storage write api.\r\n\r\nThe user passes in a function of ElementT -> TableRow, and we maintain an index of the original elements passed in to BQIO. If the function exists, we use it to generate the error row, instead of the default behavior of emitting the failure directly.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

current implementation is, essentially, a distributed hashmap from integer keys to the list contents, mediated by each upstream worker starting at a random value to minimize overlaps and emitting sufficient metadata to map this onto the contiguous range [0, N). This provides optimal *random-access* performance, but very poor *iteration* performance (essentially having to do a key lookup for every advance, and as the keys are hashed and distributed rather than clustered numerically, there is little to no amortiziation in these lookups for adjacent items.\r\n\r\nGiven that most uses for List side inpupts are merely to gather a collection of values (the user has no control over the ordering when materialized) and the high costs of providing random access, this is probably the wrong tradeoff for most pipelines.\r\n\r\nThis is an update-incompatable change and so has been guarded by the update compatibility version flag. The old behavior can be explicilty asked for via a new AsList#withRandomAccess() method.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the Iceberg FileWriteResult included use of SerializableCoder and some hacks around Avro.\r\n\r\nNow it leverages Iceberg manifest files and uses AutoValueSchema on a very basic POJO, and the use of Iceberg's APIs is more robust and uses entrypoints that should continue to work indefinitely by writing and reading manifest files that point to data files.\r\n\r\nThis does double the number of files written, which is unfortunate. But it fixes the intermediate encoding to something that should continue to work for a wide variety of implementation choices.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

href=\"https://redirect.github.com/docker/cli/pull/4889\">docker/cli#4889</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug fixes and enhancements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Native Windows containers are configured with an internal DNS server for container name resolution, and external DNS servers for other lookups. Not all resolvers, including <code>nslookup</code>, fall back to the external resolvers when they get a <code>SERVFAIL</code> answer from the internal server. So, the internal DNS server can now be configured to forward requests to the external resolvers, by setting <code>&quot;features&quot;: {&quot;windows-dns-proxy&quot;: true }</code> in the <code>daemon.json</code> file. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47584\">moby/moby#47584</a></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!NOTE]\nThis will be the new default behavior in Docker Engine 27.0.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!WARNING]\nThe <code>windows-dns-proxy</code> feature flag will be removed in a future release.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Swarm: Fix <code>Subpath</code> not being passed to the container config. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47711\">moby/moby#47711</a></li>\n<li>Classic builder: Fix cache miss on <code>WORKDIR &lt;directory&gt;/</code> build step (directory with a trailing slash). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47723\">moby/moby#47723</a></li>\n<li>containerd image store: Fix <code>docker images</code> failing when any image in the store has unexpected target. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47738\">moby/moby#47738</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v26.0.2</h2>\n<h2>26.0.2</h2>\n<p>For a full list of pull requests and changes in this release, refer to the relevant GitHub milestones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/docker/cli/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A26.0.2\">docker/cli, 26.0.2 milestone</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/moby/moby/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A26.0.2\">moby/moby, 26.0.2 milestone</a></li>\n<li>Deprecated and removed features, see <a href=\"https://github.com/docker/cli/blob/v26.0.2/docs/deprecated.md\">Deprecated Features</a>.</li>\n<li>Changes to the Engine API, see <a href=\"https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/v26.0.2/docs/api/version-history.md\">API version history</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Security</h3>\n<p>This release contains a security fix for <a href=\"https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-x84c-p2g9-rqv9\">CVE-2024-32473</a>, an unexpected configuration of IPv6 on IPv4-only interfaces.</p>\n<h3>Bug fixes and enhancements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-x84c-p2g9-rqv9\">CVE-2024-32473</a>: Ensure IPv6 is disabled on interfaces only allocated an IPv4 address by the engine.  <a href=\"https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-x84c-p2g9-rqv9\">moby#GHSA-x84c-p2g9-rqv9</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v26.0.1</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

PR addresses #28187 by creating a new new gradle project `:runners:prism` to allow non-Go developers to execute the Prism server.

from Apache Beam 2.52.0, building a pipeline package provided in the `--setup_file` pipeline option happens inside an isolated build environment, which requires downloading `setuptools >= 40.8.0` at pipeline submission time.\r\n\r\nUsing isolated builds requires internet connection, which might otherwise not be necessary and not available in some scenarios. \r\n\r\nThis PR will fix the issue staring from Beam 2.56.0. Affected users could  work around the issue by either:\r\n1) uninstalling 'build' dependency in the pipeline submission environment OR\r\n2) installing their pipeline package in a custom container using the `--sdk_container_image` pipeline option or by building the package manually and passing it using the `--extra_package` option instead of using the `--setup_file` pipeline option.","created_at":"2024-04-22T19:11:53Z","updated_at":"2024-04-23T23:02:52Z","closed_at":"2024-04-22T21:16:17Z","merged_at":"2024-04-22T21:16:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"718af0d76528a8b6e6d5dcc99eb3979988960252","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1738121359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzM4MTIxMzU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/python","name":"python","color":"e2d35d","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/milestones/20","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/milestone/20","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/milestones/20/labels","id":10648607,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAwi8tc4Aonwf","number":20,"title":"2.56.0
