builds upon the existing azure extension, adding support for Azure's Blob Store as a Firehose and target for Indexing Service logs. The functionality is nearly identical to the S3 implementations. Most of the code was based off of that, simply using the Azure SDK instead.\n\nFor the firehose, I chose a uri scheme like `azureblobstore://container/path/to/your/file.json` which might seem weird considering the \"endpoint\" is actually `https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/container/path/to/your/file.json` \n\nI opted for a uri like this because the current azure extension configures settings like a storage account, access key and schema (http/https) globally. I believe using the \"official\" URI would give the illusion of being able to use any storage account, which would lead to a bad user experience.\n\nI considered a couple of other solutions like having to specify a storage account and key for each usage (ex. separate properties for the firehose account and indexing service account), but I didn't like that either as the current property for setting an account implies that it's global and I didn't want to introduce breaking changes in the azure extension. Having one that sounded global, but having it only apply to the deep storage is also a bad user experience.\n\nIf anyone has any other ideas for this I'd be happy to discuss. Otherwise, merge at will.\n","created_at":"2015-07-14T01:34:34Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:34:44Z","closed_at":"2015-07-17T23:10:22Z","merged_at":"2015-07-17T23:10:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"ea2d45562e2361f45d8ba067d3719675fa6a7ce6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/15","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/15","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/15/labels","id":1148224,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTE0ODIyNA==","number":15,"title":"0.8.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"xvrl","id":815147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTE0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl","html_url":"https://github.com/xvrl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":34,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-06-03T20:18:18Z","updated_at":"2015-09-19T00:49:07Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2015-09-19T00:49:07Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/1518/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/1518/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1518/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/0bda7af52ce2a70f37e03af9becf0c0ac0811ef7","head":{"label":"RealROI:more-azure-features","ref":"more-azure-features","sha":"0bda7af52ce2a70f37e03af9becf0c0ac0811ef7","user":{"login":"RealROI","id":8137282,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjgxMzcyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8137282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RealROI","html_url":"https://github.com/RealROI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RealROI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RealROI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RealROI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RealROI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RealROI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RealROI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RealROI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RealROI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RealROI/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39045708,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTA0NTcwOA==","name":"druid","full_name":"RealROI/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RealROI","id":8137282,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjgxMzcyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8137282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RealROI","html_url":"https://github.com/RealROI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RealROI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RealROI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RealROI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RealROI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RealROI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RealROI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RealROI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RealROI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RealROI/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RealROI/druid","description":"Column

is the first of what I hope will be a short series of PRs that will make some  generalizations and enhancements to the way things work in integration-tests. The goal is that we (and other groups) can run the tests unchanged out of the community source, and be able to contribute tests more easily.\nFor this first one, I'm proposing adding an alternate configuration class to the existing class DockerConfigProvider.\n\nWe need this because we run integration tests using other configurations than a single-host druid cluster using docker with the hardcoded port numbers present in DockerConfigProvider.java.  We also are writing tests that need configuration information other than druid host and port numbers.\n\nI added a new implementation ConfigFileConfigProvider of  IntegrationTestingConfigProvider.  It is used if druid.test.config.type is \"configFile\" rather then the default value of \"docker\", and it reads configuration information from the file specified by druid.test.config.configFile.\n\nThe first piece of new configuration information we need is the zookeeper address, because we're working on tests that use it. I added a function get ZookeeperHost() to IntegrationTestingConfigProvider and its implementations.\n\nI added to pom.xml a profile int-tests-config-file that doesn't start docker and sets the values of druid.test.config.type (to configFile) and druid.test.config.configFile (to a value from the environment).\n\nI tested by running ITRealtimeIndexerTaskTest two ways:\n. the \"docker\" way (but without docker):\n  . commented out the setup and shutdown of docker in the .sh files\n  . set the environment variable DOCKER_IP to a virtual machinewhere I have a single-host druid system running\n  . changed the hard-coded port IDs in DockerConfigProvider \n  . mvn verify -P integration-tests -Dit.test=ITIndexerTest\n. the \"config file\" way:\n  . export CONFIG_FILE=properties.json\n  . mvn verify -P int-tests-config-file -Dit.test=ITRealtimeIndexTaskTest\n","created_at":"2015-07-10T15:23:40Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:34:44Z","closed_at":"2015-07-17T23:23:54Z","merged_at":"2015-07-17T23:23:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"4d35623aa94e997e91521d89becc5f26cb689ee4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/15","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/15","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/15/labels","id":1148224,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTE0ODIyNA==","number":15,"title":"0.8.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"xvrl","id":815147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTE0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl","html_url":"https://github.com/xvrl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":34,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-06-03T20:18:18Z","updated_at":"2015-09-19T00:49:07Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2015-09-19T00:49:07Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/1507/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/1507/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1507/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/df5bc8974fc4962f05d8e79fe4a3250ac3d8921d","head":{"label":"rasahner:feature-IntTestConfig","ref":"feature-IntTestConfig","sha":"df5bc8974fc4962f05d8e79fe4a3250ac3d8921d","user":{"login":"rasahner","id":3065997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjU5OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3065997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner","html_url":"https://github.com/rasahner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34288228,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDI4ODIyOA==","name":"druid","full_name":"rasahner/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rasahner","id":3065997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjU5OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3065997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner","html_url":"https://github.com/rasahner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rasahner/druid","description":"Real²time

values\nonly.\n","created_at":"2015-07-07T13:40:53Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:34:44Z","closed_at":"2015-07-09T06:52:11Z","merged_at":"2015-07-09T06:52:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"aa3bf0380305338d4187fba1d1d9d25694acdce8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/11","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/11","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/11/labels","id":977939,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lOTc3OTM5","number":11,"title":"0.8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"xvrl","id":815147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTE0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl","html_url":"https://github.com/xvrl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":18,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-02-13T04:47:46Z","updated_at":"2015-07-28T21:49:08Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2015-07-28T21:49:08Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/1499/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/1499/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/1499/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/184b12bee849a2058e38488e01632046fc9dfc3f","head":{"label":"metamx:fix-groupby-caching","ref":"fix-groupby-caching","sha":"184b12bee849a2058e38488e01632046fc9dfc3f","user":{"login":"metamx","id":299329,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI5OTMyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/299329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx","html_url":"https://github.com/metamx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28248872,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODI0ODg3Mg==","name":"druid","full_name":"metamx/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"metamx","id":299329,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI5OTMyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/299329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx","html_url":"https://github.com/metamx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/metamx/druid","description":"Real²time

like to change the description of the local firehose to make it more clear that the search of the directory specified by baseDir is done recursively through subdirectories.  I guess I should have realized that from the use of \"baseDir\" itself, but as an old Unix user I'm not used to commands being done recursively unless I specifically say so (I know, git -add ...).  \n\nIf we make it more clear that the search is recursive, it might save someone from accidentally ingesting data that they didn't intend.\n\nI think it would also be nice to change the \"Searching for\" log message in the task log to say that it's searching \"in and beneath\" the directory, because to someone totally literal like me, searching \"in\" a directory means  searching only in that directory.  If we add a log message showing what files are being used, it could help with diagnosing the problem if an ingestion task didn't do what was expected because of using files that weren't intended to be used.\n\n(I'm assuming here that the recursion was

for https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/1463\n\nJobHelper.ensurePaths will set job properties from config (tuningConfig.jobProperties) before adding input paths to the config.\n    Adding input paths will create Path and FileSystem instances which may depend on the values in the job config.\n    This allows all properties to be set from the spec file, avoiding having to directly edit cluster xml files.\n\n```\nIndexGeneratorJob.run adds job properties before adding input paths (adding input paths may depend on having job properies set)\n\nJobHelperTest confirms that JobHelper.ensurePaths adds job

It keeps track of current offset metadata by storing it in metadata.drd with smooshed files, and will be able to recover the previous offset position after restart.\nOn restart, it take down the offset from the sequentially \"last\" valid persisted file, and rename all incomplete persist directory to a path for corrupted data. e.g. there are sub dirs /1, /2, /3, ..../8 under directory mydatasource/20150630T10:00:00-11:00:00/, and /7 doesn't contain meta.smoosh, RealtimePlumber will rename both /7 and /8 to corrupted/mydatasource/20150630T10:00:00-11:00:00/\\* and use offset from /6 as starting point.\nWhen indexing, it follows the logic:\n1. Call start()\n2. Read currRow()\n3. Call advance()\n4. If index should be committed: commit()\n5. GOTO 2\nNote it will only advance when current row is successfully processed, which means saving the end offset of current message.\n@cheddar \n\nGoogle Group

AbstractHttpClientProvider instantiates its fields eagerly, which could become problematic when extension modules tries to bind everything they need and expect the druid process to instantiate what they actually do need. Guice tries to fail-fast and verifies that all bindings exist before it does anything, which is a problem because the extension bind some objects that don't necessarily have all of their dependencies bound in all processes.(Referred to #243)\n\nThis PR lazily instantiated some fields so that they are created when they are actually

patch aims to fix issue #1016  \n\nCurrently if we put something in `druid.extensions.coordinates`, the local module that was previsouly loaded will be accidentally loaded again. The reason is that the return value of the second `ServiceLoader.load(clazz, loader)` in the original code still contains previously loaded module. Since `Set<T> retVal` is not doing its job by filtering out loaded modules, previously loaded module will be added again. If that module happens to create Guice bindings, duplicate binding errors will occur.\n\nThis patch adds a HashSet that keeps track the module names that have already been loaded.\n\nI also rearranged the order in which the extensions are loaded. Extensions explicitly specified in `druid.extensions.coordinates` have a higher

present there are multiple places from which the task status can get deleted which leads to issues where the state of middle manager and overlord gets out of sync when either the middle manager is rebooted. Also the state changes can be lost during leadership changes. \n\nThis PR makes the overlord to be the _only_ thing that deletes the status, and for it to _not_ be an ephemeral node. \nThe changes include - \n1) change task status _not_ to be ephemeral nodes \n2) If a middlemanager is restarted it updates the task status for tasks running from previous run to FAILED. \n3) RemoteTaskRunner now waits for configurable grace period before failing a task when the worker is temporarily disconnected from ZK. \n4) RemoteTaskRunner ensures proper cleanup of task status nodes.
