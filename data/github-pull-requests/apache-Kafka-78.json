https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13143), the API would return an empty list of topics making the caller incorrectly think that there were no topics in the cluster which could be confusing.

metric names that are in common between the ZooKeeper-based and KRaft-based controller must remain the same, but they were not in the AK 2.8 early access release of KRaft. For example, the non-KRaft MBean name `kafka.controller:type=KafkaController,name=OfflinePartitionsCount` incorrectly became `\"kafka.controller\":type=\"KafkaController\",name=\"OfflinePartitionCount\"` (note the added quotes and the lack of plural).  This patch fixes the issues, closes the test gap that allowed the divergence to occur, and adds deregistration logic to remove the metrics when the controller is closed (this logic was missing).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

described in the ticket, in 3.0 there was a change that resulted in no longer assigning topic IDs to the log and the partition.metadata file in certain upgrade scenarios, specifically when upgrading from IBP 2.7 or below to 3.0. This PR adds a check for whether we need to handle the LISR request given a new topic ID when one is not yet assigned in the log and code to assign a topic ID when the log is already associated to a partition in ReplicaManager.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that we may need to handle one extra LISR request per partition when we are upgrading to using topic IDs from an IBP less than 2.8 to 3.0+. After an upgrade we should not see this issue. We will also not see this issue when upgrading from < 2.8 to 2.8 or from 2.8 to 3.0. \r\n\r\nI've added tests for the upgrade scenario that would have replicated the gap before this fix. (The test fails on master)\r\n\r\nI've also revised some replicamanager tests that will now fail with inconsistent topic IDs unless we use the correct topic ID.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-25T04:08:43Z","updated_at":"2021-07-29T21:36:45Z","closed_at":"2021-07-29T21:36:45Z","merged_at":"2021-07-29T21:36:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"bebb9aeb9cc493d8acc475273c1c1c34a6a484d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11126/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11126/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/11126/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/53016dd2cbc171a72792b02a9109b941fd3f3597","head":{"label":"jolshan:KAFKA-13132","ref":"KAFKA-13132","sha":"53016dd2cbc171a72792b02a9109b941fd3f3597","user":{"login":"jolshan","id":25566826,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTY2ODI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25566826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolshan","html_url":"https://github.com/jolshan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolshan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolshan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolshan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolshan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolshan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolshan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolshan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolshan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolshan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":289319790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODkzMTk3OTA=","name":"kafka","full_name":"jolshan/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jolshan","id":25566826,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTY2ODI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25566826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolshan","html_url":"https://github.com/jolshan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolshan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolshan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolshan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolshan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolshan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolshan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolshan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolshan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolshan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jolshan/kafka","description":"Mirror

were a few followup things to address from [#10926](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10926), most importantly a number of fixes needed for the javadocs. Beyond that it's mostly just adding a few missing verification checks.\r\n\r\nGiven the whole point of this KIP was to help reduce a major source of confusion, the meaning and usage of grace period within Streams, it's critical that we have clear and correct javadocs accompanying the new APIs. For that reason I think it's very important to get this into 3.0 @kkonstantine -- it's also very low-risk, as the only non-docs changes are adding a handful of checks that already exist in the old

older versions of Kafka Streams, the `max.poll.interval.ms` config was overridden by default to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. Even after we removed this override, users of both the plain consumer client and kafka streams still set the poll interval to MAX_VALUE somewhat often. Unfortunately, this causes an overflow when computing the `joinGroupTimeoutMs` and results in it being set to the `request.timeout.ms` instead, which is much lower.\r\n\r\nThis can easily make consumers drop out of the group, since they must rejoin now within 30s (by default) yet have no obligation to almost ever call poll() given the high `max.poll.interval.ms`. We just need to check for overflow and fix it to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` when it occurs.\r\n\r\nAlso fixes a few other misc. possible overflows on the side (from a ticket I came across while searching for existing tickets on the joinGroupTimeout bug:

original code uses a `RemoteLogManagerConfig` class to store KIP-405 configs and adds three configs to `LogConfig`. This makes the code complicated and developers may be confused.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows us to access `RemoteLogManagerConfig` from `KafkaConfig` and do the same for `LogConfig`. Kafka developers will see the same interface for the KIP-405 configs. After this change, if we want to read `remoteStorageEnable` we should use `LogConfig.tieredLogConfig.remoteStorageEnable` instead of `LogConfig.remoteStorageEnable`. The same for `localRetentionMs` and `localRetentionBytes`. If we want to read configs in `RemoteLogManagerConfig`, we should use `KafkaConfig.tieredKafkaConfig.xxx`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

The record scan in the old code ensured that\r\nempty record batches were never down-converted, which hid this bug.\r\n* upgrade_test: set the IBP 2.8 when message format is < 0.11 to ensure we are\r\nactually writing with the old message format even though the test was passing\r\nwithout the change.\r\n\r\nVerified with ducker that some variants of these tests failed without these changes\r\nand passed with them.

FetchSessionHandler had a small bug in the session build method where we did not consider building a session where no partitions were added and the session previously did not use topic IDs. (ie, it was relying on at least one partition being added to signify whether topic IDs were present)\r\n\r\nDue to this, we could send forgotten partitions with the zero UUID. This would always result in an exception and closed session.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the logic to check that any forgotten partitions have topic IDs. There is also a test added for the empty session situation when topic IDs are used and when topic names are used.\r\n\r\nI also fixed a few small things in some of the previous tests.\r\n\r\n###

investigating some system test failures I found the Streams logs often got up to several GB in size, with much of it being due to these three lines being logged on repeat many times per ms:\r\n```\r\n[2021-07-19 11:15:26,880] DEBUG [] Invoking poll on main Consumer \r\n[2021-07-19 11:15:26,880] DEBUG [] Main Consumer poll completed in 0 ms and fetched 0 records \r\n[2021-07-19 11:15:26,880] DEBUG [] Thread state is already PENDING_SHUTDOWN, skipping the run once call \r\n```\r\nEven though they're debug logs this is just way too much printed way too often, and also reveals how much cpu we're wasting just spinning in this busy loop doing nothing else. It seems the situation was that the thread had been told to shut down but was waiting for an in-progress rebalance to complete before it could exit the poll loop and complete its shutdown. Turns out we were polling with `Duration.ZERO` in this case and therefore just running through the loop again and again and again within a single millisecond.\r\n\r\nSo, we should be passing in a larger timeout to `poll()` when the thread is in `PENDING_SHUTDOWN` to let it actually wait for the ongoing rebalance to finish. Also threw in a few miscellaneous fixes/cleanups that I came across on the side","created_at":"2021-07-20T02:14:11Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T03:34:42Z","closed_at":"2025-01-24T03:34:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"vvcephei","id":832787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjc4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/832787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei","html_url":"https://github.com/vvcephei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vvcephei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"cadonna","id":1042170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDIxNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1042170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna","html_url":"https://github.com/cadonna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

commit includes a few changes:\r\n\r\n1. The leader assumes that there is always an in-memory snapshot at the\r\nlast committed offset. This means that the controller needs to generate\r\nan in-memory snapshot when getting promoted from inactive to active.\r\n\r\n2. Delete all in-memory snapshots less that the last committed offset\r\nwhen the on-disk snapshot is canceled or it completes.\r\n\r\n3. The controller always starts inactive. When loading an on-disk\r\nsnapshot the controller is always inactive. This means that we don't\r\nneed to generate an in-memory snapshot at the offset -1 because there\r\nis no requirement that there exists an in-memory snapshot at the last\r\ncommitted offset when the controller is inactive.\r\n\r\n4. SnapshotRegistry's createSnapshot should allow the creating of a\r\nsnapshot if the last snapshot's offset is the given offset. This allows\r\nfor simpler client code.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-20T00:04:18Z","updated_at":"2021-07-20T17:15:48Z","closed_at":"2021-07-20T17:13:01Z","merged_at":"2021-07-20T17:13:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"69a4661d7a7578789f4752928622c010b2264565","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11084/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11084/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/11084/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/717f4f9c3e11ec782976152eb1552752b95cca8b","head":{"label":"jsancio:kafka-13100-create-snapshot-with-leadership","ref":"kafka-13100-create-snapshot-with-leadership","sha":"717f4f9c3e11ec782976152eb1552752b95cca8b","user":{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":169502372,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjk1MDIzNzI=","name":"kafka","full_name":"jsancio/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio/kafka","description":"Mirror

PR aims to utilise HighAvailabilityTaskAssignor to avoid downtime on corrupted tasks. The idea is that, when we hit TaskCorruptedException on an active task, a rebalance is triggered after we've wiped out the corrupted state stores. This will allow the assignor to temporarily redirect this task to another client who can resume work on the task while the original owner works on restoring the state from scratch.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-18T11:39:55Z","updated_at":"2021-09-28T23:50:28Z","closed_at":"2021-09-28T23:50:16Z","merged_at":"2021-09-28T23:50:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"7e573001484427dc73d821cc232a4c3bb3b5f5bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11076/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11076/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/11076/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/076199d02100f400146ddf42530df7346779dbc4","head":{"label":"vamossagar12:KAFKA-12486","ref":"KAFKA-12486","sha":"076199d02100f400146ddf42530df7346779dbc4","user":{"login":"vamossagar12","id":10499430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk5NDMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10499430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12","html_url":"https://github.com/vamossagar12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222145451,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIxNDU0NTE=","name":"kafka","full_name":"vamossagar12/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vamossagar12","id":10499430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk5NDMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10499430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12","html_url":"https://github.com/vamossagar12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vamossagar12/kafka","description":"Mirror

is an idea I had for attacking this on the consumer client level:\r\n\r\n1. When listOffset result is retrieved inside Fetcher, check if the partitions are part of the subscriptions of the consumer; if yes update the corresponding LSO or HW based on the isolation level.\r\n2. When partitionLag cannot return result since the log end offset (LSO/HW) is not known, send an async list offset which would be completed by other calls polling (also the hb thread may complete it as well), and hope the next partitionLag would get the result.\r\n\r\nThen on the streams side, the first partitionLag would still return empty, but soon enough the subsequent partitionLag should return data and we would not wait for the fetch response to update fetched state.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

up to KAFKA-10847 (https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10917).\r\n\r\nThe above fix intended to reduce the emit frequency to save the creation cost of RocksDB iterators. However, we incorrectly initialized the \"timer\" with timestamp zero, and thus, the timer was always in the past and we did try to emit left/outer join result too often and got a throughput of only 500 record/sec.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the initialization of the emit interval timer. After re-running the benchmark, we determined that a default emit interval of 1000ms provides the best performance of 12K rec/sec, so this PR also changes the emit frequency to 1000ms.","created_at":"2021-07-14T23:57:39Z","updated_at":"2021-07-16T21:30:49Z","closed_at":"2021-07-16T20:30:20Z","merged_at":"2021-07-16T20:30:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"3e38038278e8c6bb9c59432bedc81a06bc10d1de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11055/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11055/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/11055/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/1e1f5231999974a8b28316045dc25e6ef8c9bf18","head":{"label":"mjsax:fix-stream-stream-perf-1000","ref":"fix-stream-stream-perf-1000","sha":"1e1f5231999974a8b28316045dc25e6ef8c9bf18","user":{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50839421,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDgzOTQyMQ==","name":"kafka","full_name":"mjsax/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax/kafka","description":"Mirror

is useful for reads to the end of a topic that contains aborted or empty transactions. If an aborted transaction is at the end of the topic, the consumer can now be expected to return from `poll` if it advances past that aborted transaction, and users can query the consumer's latest `position` for the relevant topic partitions to see if it has managed to make it past the end of the topic (or rather, what was the end of the topic when the attempt to read to the end of the topic began).\r\n\r\nFor a concrete example of this logic, see the [`KafkaBasedLog::readToLogEnd`](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/5e5d5bff3bdaf807338ec9adeac982f8a5c98fbd/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/util/KafkaBasedLog.java#L322-L345) method that Connect employs to refresh its view of internal topics.\r\n\r\nNo new unit tests are added, but many existing ones are modified to ensure that aborted and empty transactions are detected and reported correctly by `Fetcher::collectFetch`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-14T05:01:42Z","updated_at":"2023-03-29T04:46:38Z","closed_at":"2021-12-09T04:36:53Z","merged_at":"2021-12-09T04:36:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"ddb6959c6272d2039ed8c9f595634c3c9573f85e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11046/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11046/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/11046/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/cb301155f3b63fb820f9962368c4efcdc1f13bcb","head":{"label":"C0urante:kafka-12980","ref":"kafka-12980","sha":"cb301155f3b63fb820f9962368c4efcdc1f13bcb","user":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83460713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQ2MDcxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"C0urante/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante/kafka","description":"Mirror
