using api gateway with standalone mode (#4516). \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nEnables launching api gateway with `--api-gw` option\r\n\r\n```\r\njava -jar openwhisk-standalone.jar --api-gw \r\n```\r\n\r\nWith `-a` flag following tasks would be performed\r\n\r\n1. Install route management actions for `createApi`, `deleteApi` and `getApi`\r\n2. Launch the redis server and wait for it to be ready\r\n3. Compute the host ip (see Host url logic section below)\r\n4. Launch the Api gateway container (at 3234 port by default) and pass the redis ip and local host ip\r\n\r\n### Host url logic\r\n\r\nDue to issue in #4523 and apache/incubator-openwhisk-apigateway#345 we need to compute the actual ip for `host.docker.internal` and pass it as part of `BACKEND_HOST` env variable\r\n\r\n### Port Handling\r\n\r\nThis PR requires only 2 ports to be actually free 3233 for main server and 3234 for api gateway management port.\r\n\r\nFor redis and api gateway api port it tries to use std port (6479 for redis and 9000 for api). If they are not free it would try to allocate a random port and use them. This should minimize port conflict for end users\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Gradle to 5.5 version and also updates Gradle Scoverage plugin to 3.1.5\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nFor enabling running and building on JDK 11 (#4217) we need to move to Gradle 5.x version which officially supports JDK 11. In doing so we would need to update the [Gradle Scoverage](https://github.com/scoverage/gradle-scoverage) plugin to 3.1.5 as existing version was not compatible\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\n1. Enables building on JDK 11\r\n2. Gradle 5.x has better support for Maven publishing. We would now be needing that to publish the standalone jar\r\n\r\n### Scoverage Version Impact\r\n\r\nNewer soverage plugin has a different model of working and does not produce a jar of instrumented classes which impacts our logic for coverage collection for code running within container (#3685). To make it work we now copy the instrumented classes within container and remove existing packaged jars from the lib\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#4217 )\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

auditability reasons it would be beneficial to also specify a reason for the set limits command (why was a certain namespace throttled on a given limit).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a reason parameter to the `wskadmin` tool. It is the most simple implementation where the reason value would be overwritten by each new set limits command. \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"_id\": \"<namespace>/limits\",\r\n  \"firesPerMinute\": 100,\r\n  \"invocationsPerMinute\": 200,\r\n  \"reason\": \"throttle namespace on invocations per minute because of ..\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to have a kind of audit trail/log available the history of changes on the `/limits` documents needs to be stored. Please find below a sample of the `/limits` document containing an audit log. However this PR does not implement an audit log but only adds a single reason parameter to the `/limits` document as described above.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"_id\": \"<namespace>/limits\",\r\n  \"firesPerMinute\": 100,\r\n  \"invocationsPerMinute\": 200,\r\n  \"reasons\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"reason\": \"throttle namespace on fires per minute because of ..\",\r\n      \"time\": \"1562317956422\",\r\n      \"limits\": {\r\n        \"firesPerMinute\": 100\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"reason\": \"throttle namespace on invocations per minute because of ..\",\r\n      \"time\": \"1562318956422\",\r\n      \"limits\": {\r\n        \"invocationsPerMinute\": 200\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis code change add an additional reason parameter to the wskadmin tool to store in addition the reason for the set limits command for auditability reasons..\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [x] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

completion acks can be a source of overloaded invokers because forced acks free up invoker slots in the load balancer. If the invoker is just \"late\" with running an activation so that the invoker sends the result / completion ack after the completion ack timeout has been reached in the load balancer, the load balancer may send new activations to the invoker while it is still fully occupied. As a result, these new activations have to wait for a container and can cause forced completion acks in turn. This mechanism can lead to a never-ending chain reaction if an invoker has a constant stream of workload.\r\n\r\nGoal of this change is to improve visibility and diagnostic information so that this mechanism can be better understood and fixed in the next step.\r\n\r\n* Add metrics for forced completion acks.\r\n* Log more diagnostic information when forcing a completion ack due to timeout.\r\n* Log a warning if a completion ack arrives after it has already been forced - this is an indication that action processing took too long. Today, this situation is only logged as debug message.\r\n* Improve code comments.\r\n* Provide a function for calculating the completion ack timeout.

is a proof of concept to execute OpenWhisk actions via [Weave Ignite][1] which uses [Firecracker MicroVMs][2]\r\n\r\nRecently [Weave works announced Ignite][3] project which supports running compatible docker images as [Firecracker MicroVMs][4]. Such an execution can provide better security compared to simple container based execution. \r\n\r\n## Objective\r\n\r\nSome of the key aspects here are\r\n\r\n1. Rebuild OpenWhisk runtime as Ignote compatible docker image\r\n2. Execute action via vm build from those images\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### 1. Install Ignite\r\n\r\nFollow the [Ignite installation steps][6] and ensure that required [dependencies][7] are met. OpenWhisk would check for `ignite` cli  at `/usr/local/bin/ignite`\r\n\r\n### 2. Build a Ignite compatible docker image for nodejs. \r\n\r\nCurrently a docker file is provided for nodejs 12 [here][5]\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ cd tools/ignite/nodejs\r\n$ docker build -t whisk/ignite-nodejs-v12:latest  .\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3.

See [Getting started with Ignite][8] to get a quick overview of how ignite works\r\n\r\nUpon first launch it would\r\n\r\n1. Import the image via `ignite image import whisk/ignite-nodejs-v12:latest`. This would implicitly pull the image if not present\r\n2. Create and run the vm `ignite run whisk/ignite-nodejs-v12:latest --cpus 1 --memory 256m --size 1GB --name wsk0_1_prewarm_nodejs12`\r\n3. Connect to the 8080 port of launched vm for actual execution\r\n\r\n`IgniteContainer` would also figure out the matching docker container running for given vm and use that to make calls as being done with standard Docker implementation. \r\n\r\n### Docker Image\r\n\r\nFor any docker image to be usable with `ignite` it must have init system present. For this it provides some [base images][10]. This PR uses there centos image to build a custom nodejs action runtime image\r\n\r\n```\r\nFROM openwhisk/action-nodejs-v12:1.14.0-incubating AS ownode\r\n\r\nFROM weaveworks/ignite-centos\r\n\r\nRUN curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | bash -\r\nRUN sudo yum -y install nodejs\r\n\r\nCOPY --from=ownode /nodejsAction /nodejsAction\r\nCOPY --from=ownode /node_modules /node_modules\r\nCOPY ./action.service /etc/systemd/system/\r\n\r\nRUN chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/action.service \\\r\n    && systemctl enable action.service\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Service Startup\r\n\r\nDespite `ignite` use of OCI Image the end result is a vm being launched. So for our action runtime to be launches this docker image also adds a [systemd][10] service\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Unit]\r\nDescription=OpenWhisk Nodejs action server\r\nWants=network-online.target\r\nAfter=network-online.target\r\n\r\n[Service]\r\nWorkingDirectory=/nodejsAction\r\nExecStart=/usr/bin/node --expose-gc app.js\r\n\r\n[Install]\r\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo upon startup of vm the node server would be launched and it would bind to 8080 port.\r\n\r\n### Logging\r\n\r\nCurrently `logs` support does not work. For that we need to figure out how to route nodejs logs to vm logs. These logs are then routed to docker logging sub system so we can then fetch it via standard docker log access. \r\n\r\n### Things to note\r\n\r\nCurrently the cold start takes long time as for some reason even if vm launches quickly the nodejs server does not respond for some time post start. This aspect would need to be investigated\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/weaveworks/ignite\r\n[2]: https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/\r\n[3]:

test failed because only 1003 files could be opened.\r\n* The test makes sure that it's always a cold invocation, so the failure was not caused by open files carried over from an earlier

#4521 where we observed out of memory during test runs because MesosContainerFactory continues to retry failed subscribe thus filling up the in memory logger\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nIn #4521 it was observed that `MesosContainerFactory` continues to execute the subscribe task even after test finishes. Ideally upon close of actor system such subscribe efforts should stop automatically. However somehow the threads continue to remain active.\r\n\r\nSo now we close the factory and disable subscribe upon close after each test run. With this its confirmed there were no stray away threads running and thus no memory leakage should happen due to this\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#4521 )\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Add information whether the action memory / time limits are standard, i.e. default, or not.\r\n* Restructure message and shorten it to make log volume smaller despite adding information.\r\n* The code uses the term \"scheduling an activation to an invoker\". Change message to use this term.\r\n* Also add more information to message that indicates that an activation could not be scheduled to an invoker because no usable invokers are available. The additional information helps to identify which particular activation was affected.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n* The proposed message changes are meant to help operators with understanding the effects of overloading an invoker with more activations than it can process in parallel from a user memory perspective. This can happen in an overload situation - i.e. no invoker has enough free memory available - or when activations time out with a forced acknowledgement.\r\n* If operators want to debug overloaded invokers, the time limit information gives an upper bound for how long an activation may occupy the invoker.\r\n* If actions use standard (default) memory and time limits, it's probably hard to draw conclusions regarding actual invoker load. Whenever non-standard limits are set, conclusions regarding actual invoker load are more meaningful. That's why this proposal adds information whether limits are set to standard values or not.\r\n\r\nSample message changes...\r\n\r\n*Successful schedule*\r\n\r\nOld: `activation 0123456789abcdef1234567890abcdef for 'namespace/package/action@0.0.1' (managed) by namespace 'namespace' with memory limit 256MB assigned to invoker0`\r\n\r\nNew: `scheduled activation 0123456789abcdef1234567890abcdef, action 'namespace/package/action@0.0.1' (managed), ns 'namespace', mem limit 256 MB (std), time limit 60000 ms (std) to invoker0`\r\n\r\n*Unsuccessful schedule*\r\n\r\nOld: `failed to schedule managed action, invokers to use: Map(Unhealthy -> 2)`\r\n\r\nNew: `failed to schedule activation 0123456789abcdef1234567890abcdef, action 'namespace/package/action@0.0.1' (managed), ns 'namespace' - invokers to use: Map(Unhealthy -> 2)`\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [x] Loadbalancer: only message enhancements\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

PR is a small consistency fix for the `wskadmin` tool. If the `wskadmin` tool is called to get the currently set limits on a given namespace, it should not print out `Failed to get limits ..` if the limits document is deleted on the database but handle it the same way as if the limits document does not exists (`No limits found, default system limits apply`). This is more consistent as the message shown by `wskadmin` should be the same for both cases. \r\nIn addition, both cases (missing and deleted limits document) shouldn't be treated as error in my opinion and hence the `wskadmin` shouldn't return with a non-zero code, but this is open to discussion.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis code change changes the messages printed by the `wskadmin` tool

Whenever invoker or controller cluster status changes, the ShardingContainerPoolBalancer updates its state. If a new invoker registers, it is added to the load balancer status with its user memory capacity and a book-keeping semaphor is created to be used for scheduling load. If the controller cluster size changes, all invoker book-keeping semaphors are updated to reflect the user memory shard size managed by each controller.\r\n* This change logs more diagnostic information when the ShardingContainerPoolBalancer updates its state due to invoker or controller cluster size changes.\r\n* The additional information helps with understanding how much user memory is available on invokers and is available on the controller's shard.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n* This change only introduces log message extensions and should NOT change any behaviour.\r\n* Collecting the information for log messages is in O(number of invokers). Complexity of computation is similar to what is done anyway when updating the ShardingContainerPoolBalancer state.\r\n* In a healthy OpenWhisk system, state updates should happen rarely after startup has completed so that the additional computations should not affect scheduling performance.\r\n\r\nSample messages after three new invokers have registered:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2019-06-25T10:40:06.705Z] [INFO] [#tid_sid_loadbalancer] [ShardingContainerPoolBalancerState] loadbalancer invoker status updated. managedInvokers = 3 blackboxInvokers = 3. number of known invokers increased: new = 3, old = 0. details: invoker0: Unhealthy / 4096 MB of 4096 MB, invoker1: Offline / 4096 MB of 4096 MB, invoker2: Offline / 4096 MB of 4096 MB.\r\n[2019-06-25T10:40:06.705Z] [INFO] [#tid_sid_loadbalancer] [ShardingContainerPoolBalancerState] loadbalancer invoker status updated. managedInvokers = 3 blackboxInvokers = 3. no update required - number of known invokers unchanged: 3.\r\n[2019-06-25T10:40:06.705Z] [INFO] [#tid_sid_loadbalancer] [ShardingContainerPoolBalancerState] loadbalancer invoker status updated. managedInvokers = 3 blackboxInvokers = 3. no update required - number of known invokers unchanged: 3.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSample message after the controller cluster with 2 controllers is up and running.

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nAs mentioned in #4347 there is a current issue of retrieval large log messages stored in Splunk. \r\n\r\nThis artifice suggested by the Splunk support, will fix this problem and will allow the retrieval of messages larger than 10KB in size.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to extract the `log_message` value from the `_row` field and store it in a new field using `spath`. More documentation on `spath` [here](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.3.0/SearchReference/Spath). \r\nThere is no need to have `activation_id` in a new field using `spath` as it can be easily retrieved from the already existing one, that is why I have replaced `activation_id` with `log_message` in the `spath` command. \r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#4518)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

running a minimal OpenWhisk (with in memory store) as a runnable jar outside of docker\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nCurrently users looking to explore  OpenWhisk directly have few options like [devtools docker compose][1], mini kube etc. This PR provides yet another option which enables launching a fully working OpenWhisk server via a runnable jar\r\n\r\n```\r\njava -jar openwhisk-standalone-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis launches a fully functional OpenWhisk controller and invoker. You can run `wsk` commands against it and launch and execute actions etc. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"617\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/664531/60118122-3cf52500-9799-11e9-9241-dc00fca94c20.png\">\r\n\r\nTo try it out currently you can download a pre built jar from [here](https://github.com/chetanmeh/incubator-openwhisk/releases/tag/v0.10) \r\n\r\n### Design\r\n\r\nThis PR builds up on [lean openwhisk](#4216) support. It configures OpenWhisk to use a `MemoryArtifactStore` (thus avoiding nead of a separate CouchDB container) and enables executing the standard `wsk` commands against it\r\n\r\nSee also the [discussion thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/7425131f1fc11a9fd21e9c049be702837841c47004da03b7f215a0d6@%3Cdev.openwhisk.apache.org%3E)\r\n\r\nKey aspects\r\n\r\n* Configured by default to use a `MemoryArtifactStore`\r\n* Can be configured to use another store via simple config\r\n* Delievered as a jar executable\r\n* Adapts the config as per OS\r\n* Bootstraps a set of default users (guest and whisk.system)\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nFirst build the standalone module\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./gradlew :core:standalone:build\r\n```\r\n\r\n*In future*\r\n```\r\nwget maven/openwhisk.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\nLaunch the server\r\n```\r\n$ java -jar openwhisk-standalone-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -h\r\nOpenWhisk standalone launcher\r\n  -c, --config-file  <arg>   application.conf which overwrites the default\r\n                             whisk.conf\r\n  -m, --manifest  <arg>      Manifest json defining the supported runtimes\r\n  -p, --port  <arg>          Server port\r\n  -h, --help                 Show help message\r\n$ java -jar openwhisk-standalone-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n### When to use\r\n\r\nThis mode may be benefical in cases like\r\n\r\n* Running simple test against an OpenWhisk server say when testing compositions\r\n* Faster development cycle - No need to build and relaunch docker container to test out simple changes in regular development flow on OpenWhisk core codebase\r\n* Easier entrypoint for new users to get a feel of OpenWhisk features\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

activations in case of high volume we are seeing connection pool related error. This PR adds an optional support for having queued writes\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nIn case of high volume of writes on Invoker we are seeing errors like \r\n\r\n```\r\n[2019-06-11T00:37:10.196Z] [ERROR] Network failureio.reactivex.netty.client.PoolExhaustedException: null    \r\n    at io.reactivex.netty.client.ConnectionPoolImpl.performAquire(ConnectionPoolImpl.java:177)  \r\n    at io.reactivex.netty.client.ConnectionPoolImpl.access$300(ConnectionPoolImpl.java:45)  \r\n    at io.reactivex.netty.client.ConnectionPoolImpl$1.call(ConnectionPoolImpl.java:139) \r\n    at io.reactivex.netty.client.ConnectionPoolImpl$1.call(ConnectionPoolImpl.java:124) \r\n    at rx.internal.operators.OnSubscribeLift.call(OnSubscribeLift.java:48)  \r\n    at rx.internal.operators.OnSubscribeLift.call(OnSubscribeLift.java:30)  \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was observed with a pool size of 1000.  To prevent such cases it would be better to have a more controlled way of writing documents to db. Earlier for CouchDB similar thing was done via #2812 where batched writes were used. Currently CosmosDB does not provide an easy way to perform batched writes (Azure/azure-cosmosdb-java#182). \r\n\r\n### Design\r\n\r\nTo enable controlled writes this PR introduces a `QueuedExecutor` (similar in spirit to existing `Batcher` implementation) which ensures that writes are queued and then prcessed in a controlled way. Key points\r\n\r\n* The queue size is tracked as a gauge metric\r\n* Implementation ensures that upon close any existing entry in queue should get persisted\r\n* Proper [backpressure is not possible][1]. So in case of very excessive writes entries would be dropped. Other option is to set a higher queue size but that can result in out of memory scenario. \r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n```\r\n  cosmosdb {\r\n    collections {\r\n      WhiskActivation {\r\n        write-queue-config = {\r\n          # Size of in memory queue. If queue gets full then put calls would be rejected\r\n          queue-size = 100000\r\n\r\n          # Number of concurrent connections to use to perform writes to db\r\n          concurrency = 500\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Future Enhancement\r\n\r\nWe can possibly optimize the write throughput by implementing the bulk write logic as used in [CosmosDB Bulk Importer](https://chapsas.com/how-the-cosmosdb-bulk-executor-works-under-the-hood/). This would require us to batch the inserts and then sort by partition and send the calls to respective partition.\r\n\r\nAnother possible option to reduce heap pressure would be to store the object in byte array form in queue and deserialize before passing to `ArtifactStore`\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

when `whisk.container-factory.runtimes-registry.url` is set to a specific registry, default runtime images in the manifest are pulled from that registry. Other images provided by users are left intact.\r\nIn a multi-region and multi-cloud deployment of OpenWhisk, it is useful for the system operators to force all runtime images (default and blackbox) to be pulled from specific registries.\r\nThis requires the registry hostname components be parsed from image names.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- makes ImageName registry aware: differentiate `registry` and `prefix` in ImageName parser.\r\n- adds config to automatically append optional registry hostname to user images, if they do not contain any hostname.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n* If `whisk.container-factory.runtimes-registry.url` is set, all default runtime images are retrieved from the specified registry, otherwise they are pulled from Docker Hub.\r\n* If `whisk.container-factory.user-images-registry.url` is set, all user images (blackbox) are retrieved from the specified registry, otherwise they are pulled from Docker Hub.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [x] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nThe API GW Test are able to drive OW into throttling. Though some code existed to \r\nthrottle down these tests these tests were failing constantly on faster machines\r\nwith 429 returned by OW.\r\n\r\nThe test code controlling the throttle was correct in throttling the test execution in isolation,\r\nbut was of course not able to overview invocations for the given namspace that do happen \r\nbefore tests were executing.\r\n\r\nSince this limitations does naturally exist, this change simplifies down the throttling logic\r\nto enhance code maintainability and introduces a wait period before executing the tests to ensure \r\nthat the API

collection currently uses `lazy` indexing policy. Per MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs#23875 this is deprecated and should be avoided.\r\n\r\n> Lazy mode performs updates to the index at a much lower priority level when the engine is not doing any other work. Because of this query performance can be highly unpredictable. It can also result in higher cost queries because the query engine has to do more work because it can't answer the query from the index. For these reasons we recommend against customers using it.\r\n\r\nThis PR switches to consistent indexing policy. \r\n\r\n### Disable automatic index policy update logic\r\n\r\nFurther it also removes logic to automatically update the indexing policy if the collection already exists. Instead it would now log a warning log\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2019-05-17T14:47:36.102Z] [WARN] Indexing policy for collection [activations] found to be different.\r\nExpected - {\"automatic\":true,\"indexingMode\":\"Lazy\",\"includedPaths\":[{\"path\":\"/namespace/?\",\"indexes\":[{\"kind\":\"Hash\",\"dataType\":\"String\",\"precision\":-1}]},{\"path\":\"/_c/nspath/?\",\"indexes\":[{\"kind\":\"Hash\",\"dataType\":\"String\",\"precision\":-1}]},{\"path\":\"/start/?\",\"indexes\":[{\"kind\":\"Range\",\"dataType\":\"Number\",\"precision\":-1}]}],\"excludedPaths\":[{\"path\":\"/\"}]}\r\nExisting - {\"automatic\":true,\"indexingMode\":\"Lazy\",\"includedPaths\":[{\"path\":\"/namespace/?\",\"indexes\":[]},{\"path\":\"/_c/nspath/?\",\"indexes\":[]},{\"path\":\"/start/?\",\"indexes\":[]}],\"excludedPaths\":[{\"path\":\"/\"},{\"path\":\"/\\\"_etag\\\"/?\"}]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny index update would then need to be done manually by the system administrator\r\n\r\n### Dropping Hash index\r\n\r\nNow the index docs do not mention of `Hash` index and per [this comment](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmosdb-java/issues/93#issuecomment-491417946) those are removed.\r\n\r\nAlso see [obsolete attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/index-policy#obsolete-attributes)\r\n\r\nDue to this now Indexing policy does not use them and always sets the index kind to Range.

Kafka client metrics via Kamon for monitoring\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nCurrently Kafka metrics are not getting tracked via Kamon. Due to this we do not gain any insight into the Kafka interactions. Out of the box Kafka [tracks quite a few metrics][1] on client side these metrics are exposed via JMX\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/664531/57769171-deb13d00-772a-11e9-86a5-15f235c253aa.png)\r\n\r\nIt also support custom [MetricsReporter][2] to listen to such metrics. This PR makes use of same reporter support to publish the metrics to Kamon (based on approach taken in [kamon-metrics-reporter][3])\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n`KamonMetricsReporter` needs to be enabled via config and provided a set of metric names to track.\r\n\r\n```\r\nwhisk {\r\n  kafka {\r\n    common {\r\n      metric-reporters = \"org.apache.openwhisk.connector.kafka.KamonMetricsReporter\"\r\n    }\r\n    metrics {\r\n      // Name of metrics which should be tracked via Kamon\r\n      names = [\r\n        // consumer-fetch-manager-metrics\r\n        \"records-lag-max\", // The maximum lag in terms of number of records for any partition in this window\r\n        \"records-consumed-total\" // The total number of records consumed\r\n      ]\r\n\r\n      report-interval = 10 seconds\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce enabled those metrics would be pushed to Kamon. For above config following metrics can be seen in Prometheus\r\n\r\n```\r\n# TYPE consumer_fetch_manager_metrics_records_consumed_total counter\r\nconsumer_fetch_manager_metrics_records_consumed_total{client_id=\"consumer-completed0\"} 2.0\r\nconsumer_fetch_manager_metrics_records_consumed_total{client_id=\"consumer-cacheInvalidation\"} 0.0\r\nconsumer_fetch_manager_metrics_records_consumed_total{client_id=\"consumer-health\"} 1007.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nThis PR takes a whitelist approach and does not publishes all metrics by default. As there are more than 300 metrics tracked by Kafka across Producer and Consumer.\r\n\r\nFor counters Kafka records two types of metrics `total` and `rate`. See [KIP-187][4] for details. So we should ignore metrics ending with `rate` and prefer `total` metrics for Kamon tracking\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [x] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

the automated test cases to also work with nodejs:10 as default nodejs runtime.\r\nThese changes are to prepare for the upcoming nodejs:6 deprecation.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nWhen switching to nodejs:10 as the default nodejs runtime, several testcases fail. Reason for this is, that the test cases assume/expect, nodejs:6 is used to execute the actions. With the deprecation of nodejs:6 it will be necessary that the tests will work with a newer nodejs version.\r\nThe testcases have now been modified to work with nodejs:6 and with nodejs:10 as the default runtime. Nodejs:8 may also work, but has not been tested.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not change the default nodejs runtime. It is just to prepare for switching to nodejs:10 as the default runtime.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the test now explicitly execute on nodejs:10 and also check, that they were executed in nodejs:10.\r\nSome testcases have been modified so that they run on nodejs:6 and nodejs:10.\r\nNo tests have been removed, means there is no change in test coverage.\r\n\r\nThe tests have been executed with nodejs:6 and with nodejs:10 as the default runtime (runtime.json). In both cases the modified tests succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] see https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/issues/4265\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\nIn S3AttachmentStore, deleting attachments for entity documents is performed by:\r\n* listing bucket keys that match the document name as prefix\r\n* deleting each matching key\r\n\r\nThe current matching logic for listing bucket keys specific to a document matches attachment keys for other documents in some cases, where the document name prefix is the same as the to-be-deleted document.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\nConsidering these 2 actions:\r\n* <package1>/<action1>\r\n* <package1>/<action1>foo\r\ndeleting <package1>/<action1> will cause deletion of bucket keys:\r\n* <package1>/<action1>/attach1\r\n* <package1>/<action1>/attach2\r\n* <package1>/<action1>foo/attach3\r\n* <package1>/<action1>foo/attach3\r\n\r\nTo repair this, I updated the matching to include a trailing slash, and updated the attachment delete test to verify this.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an
