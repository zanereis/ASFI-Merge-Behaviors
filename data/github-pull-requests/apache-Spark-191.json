for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMark SHS event log entries that were `processing` at the beginning of the `checkForLogs` run as not stale and check for this mark before deleting an event log. This fixes the issue when a particular job was displayed in the SHS and disappeared after some time, but then, in several minutes showed up again.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe issue is caused by [SPARK-29043](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29043), which is designated to improve the concurrent performance of the History Server. The [change](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25797/files#) breaks the [\"app deletion\" logic](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25797/files#diff-128a6af0d78f4a6180774faedb335d6168dfc4defff58f5aa3021fc1bd767bc0R563) because of missing proper synchronization for `processing` event log entries. Since SHS now [filters out](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25797/files#diff-128a6af0d78f4a6180774faedb335d6168dfc4defff58f5aa3021fc1bd767bc0R462) all `processing` event log entries, such entries do not have a chance to be [updated with the new `lastProcessed`](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25797/files#diff-128a6af0d78f4a6180774faedb335d6168dfc4defff58f5aa3021fc1bd767bc0R472) time and thus any entity that completes processing right after [filtering](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25797/files#diff-128a6af0d78f4a6180774faedb335d6168dfc4defff58f5aa3021fc1bd767bc0R462) and before [the check for stale entities](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25797/files#diff-128a6af0d78f4a6180774faedb335d6168dfc4defff58f5aa3021fc1bd767bc0R560) will be identified as stale and will be deleted from the UI until the next `checkForLogs` run. This is because [updated `lastProcessed` time is used as criteria](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25797/files#diff-128a6af0d78f4a6180774faedb335d6168dfc4defff58f5aa3021fc1bd767bc0R557), and event log entries that missed to be updated with a new time, will match that criteria.  \r\n\r\nThe issue can be reproduced by generating a big number of event logs and uploading them to the SHS event log directory on S3. Essentially, around 800(82.6 MB) copies of an event log file were created using [shs-monitor](https://github.com/vladhlinsky/shs-monitor) script. Strange behavior of SHS counting the total number of applications was noticed - at first, the number was increasing as expected, but with the next page refresh, the total number of applications decreased. No errors were logged by SHS.\r\n\r\n241 entities are displayed at `20:50:42`:\r\n![1-241-entities-at-20-50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61428392/102611539-c2138d00-4137-11eb-9bbd-d77b22041f3b.png)\r\n203 entities are displayed at `20:52:17`:\r\n![2-203-entities-at-20-52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61428392/102611561-cdff4f00-4137-11eb-91ed-7405fe58a695.png)\r\nThe number of loaded applications over time:\r\n![4-loaded-applications](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61428392/102611586-d8b9e400-4137-11eb-8747-4007fc5469de.png)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, SHS users won't face the behavior when the number of displayed applications decreases periodically.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTested using [shs-monitor](https://github.com/vladhlinsky/shs-monitor) script:\r\n* Build SHS with the proposed change \r\n* Download Hadoop AWS and AWS Java SDK\r\n* Prepare S3 bucket and user for programmatic access, grant required roles to the user. Get access key and secret key\r\n* Configure SHS to read event logs from S3\r\n* Start [monitor](https://github.com/vladhlinsky/shs-monitor/blob/main/monitor.sh) script to query SHS API\r\n* Run 8 [producers](https://github.com/vladhlinsky/shs-monitor/blob/main/producer.sh) for ~10 mins, create 805(83.1 MB) event log copies\r\n* Wait for SHS to load all the applications\r\n* Verify that the number of loaded applications increases continuously over time\r\n![5-loaded-applications-fixed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61428392/102617363-bf1d9a00-4141-11eb-9bae-f982d02fd30f.png)\r\n\r\nFor more details, please refer to the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPlease refer SPARK-28190 to refer rationalization of introducing new state data source.\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes introducing a new data source \"state\" on streaming query, and enable users' batch query to read state in checkpoint. The new data source is located in sql-core module - I didn't create a new module in external since state is not an external storage.\r\n\r\nState data source leverages existing state store APIs which would be compatible with any state store providers.\r\n\r\nThere're some parameters on read path:\r\n\r\n| parameter | required | description | default value |\r\n|-----------|----------|------------|--------------|\r\n| checkpointLocation | true | Provide the checkpoint location on streaming query. | |\r\n| version | false | The version (batch id) to read. | The latest committed batch ID |\r\n| operatorId | false | The operator ID to read. | 0 |\r\n| storeName | false | The store name to read. | \"default\" |\r\n\r\nThe checkpoint location is only required and others are optional. If the streaming query contains one streaming aggregation or one flatMapGroupsWithState, we only need to provide the checkpoint location to get started. For stream-stream join (multiple states exist with different storeNames) or multiple stateful operators in a query, we still need to provide operatorId and storeName manually.\r\n\r\nState data source supports schema inference - it will read the schema information built when Spark runs structured streaming query (added in SPARK-27237). In most cases schema inference would simply work and we don't need to provide the schema manually.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the schema of state is changed on compatible way (see SPARK-27237 for details), and such case the inferred schema may not reflect the latest schema of state. (Though the difference is only the name or nullability.) In this case, we can provide the schema of state manually to correct it, as `.schema(manualSchema)`.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the simple usage case (read latest committed, 1 stateful operator, non stream-stream join) would follow:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval stateReadDf = spark.read\r\n  .format(\"state\")\r\n  .option(StateDataSourceV2.PARAM_CHECKPOINT_LOCATION, <checkpoint location>)\r\n  .load()\r\n\r\nstateReadDf.printSchema()\r\n\r\n// you can run any operations available in batch query with `stateReadDf`\r\n```\r\n\r\nand for `flatMapGroupsWithState` where we tend to use (case) class on the value type of state, we can even decode the value of state rows back to the (case) class instances, like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimplicit val encoder = Encoders.product[SessionInfo]\r\nval newDf = stateReadDf.selectExpr(\"value.groupState.*\").as[SessionInfo]\r\n// if you're reading the state created from Spark 2.3 (state format version 1), you'll want to do below instead\r\n// stateReadDf.selectExpr(\"value.*\").drop(\"timeoutTimestamp\").as[SessionInfo]\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor stream-stream join, there're multiple store names based on the internal representation:\r\n\r\n* left-keyToNumValues\r\n* left-keyWithIndexToValue\r\n* right-keyToNumValues\r\n* right-keyWithIndexToValue\r\n\r\nand we need to provide the store name to read each one. As an improvement, based on the feature we could provide the API to hide the internal details and only provide buffered rows. That can be done in separate JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe state in Structured Streaming has been a black-box outside of streaming query. There's no way to reason about the content of the state, and end users have to rely on the output of streaming query without doubt. If doubt, they have to infer the value from the output of streaming query, which is unintuitive, and even to do this they have to provide new inputs which would also modify the state. So technically there's no way to look into \"current\" value of state.\r\n(complete mode isn't a solution, as it's limited to the some operations, and in many cases you'll end up with connecting to the memory sink which won't work with large state.)\r\n\r\nThe new data source \"state\" will provide the functionality to read the content of state, so that end users can reason about the current status easily. There're more possible use cases, which will come along with write functionality.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. The new built-in data source \"state\" is exposed to the end users.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests added to verify the behavior.","created_at":"2020-12-18T12:06:08Z","updated_at":"2021-07-20T00:07:32Z","closed_at":"2021-07-20T00:07:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c61bc1c25cf51f48563c444ff98bcf0f080a4edb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs described in SPARK-33791, to add an option for user to use Hive legacy compatible grouping__id algorithm.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSee this https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Enhanced+Aggregation%2C+Cube%2C+Grouping+and+Rollup\r\n\r\nHive's grouping__id function algorithm changes between < 2.3 and >= 2.3, currently spark works the same with hive > 2.3, but for users from legacy hive (mainly hive 1.x), they may face a big problem of data error when migrating their query directly to spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes,  for sql like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect col1, col2, col3, GROUPING__ID, count(*) \r\nfrom (\r\nVALUES ('aaa', '123', 'kkk'), ('aaa', '234', 'kkk'), ('aaa', '234', 'kkk'), ('aaa', '123', 'kkk') \r\n) AS t (col1, col2, col3) \r\ngroup by col1, col2, col3 \r\nwith cube \r\norder by col1, col2, col3\r\n```\r\n\r\nfor spark default, the result is: \r\n\r\n> NULL    NULL    NULL    7       4\r\nNULL    NULL    kkk     6       4\r\nNULL    123     NULL    5       2\r\nNULL    123     kkk     4       2\r\nNULL    234     NULL    5       2\r\nNULL

  1       2\r\naaa     234     kkk     0       2\r\n\r\nwhen hive legacy mode is enabled, the result is:\r\n\r\n> NULL    NULL    NULL    0       4\r\nNULL    NULL    kkk     4       4\r\nNULL    123

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to expose `DataStreamReader.table` (SPARK-32885) and `DataStreamWriter.toTable` (SPARK-32896) to PySpark, which are the only way to read and write with table in Structured Streaming.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPlease refer SPARK-32885 and SPARK-32896 for rationalizations of these public APIs. This PR only exposes them to PySpark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, PySpark users will be able to read and write with table in Structured Streaming

So, this difference can make the distribution requirement check fail in `EnsureRequirements`:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/1e85707738a830d33598ca267a6740b3f06b1861/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/exchange/EnsureRequirements.scala#L47-L50\r\n\r\nThe `Cast` class that does not have a `timeZoneId` field is generated in the `HashJoin` object. To fix this issue, this PR proposes to use the `CastSupport.cast` method there.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport PR for #30818.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds `spark.sql.adaptive.force.if.shuffle` config option which, if set to true, causes `OptimizeSkewedJoin` to perform skew mitigation even if it requires a new shuffle to be performed.\r\nFor example, current behavior is not perform skew mitigation in the following query\r\n```\r\nProject\r\n|-Group By key1\r\n  |-SMJ on key1 = key2\r\n```\r\nWith `spark.sql.adaptive.force.if.shuffle=true`, the SMJ will become `skew=true` and a new shuffle will be added for the Aggregate.  New shuffle itself will be processed by AQE and coalesced, etc if needed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt enables AQE to apply in cases where the cost of extra shuffle is less than the cost of unmitigated skew.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, with `spark.sql.adaptive.force.if.shuffle=false`, which is the default\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew UTs + enhancements of existing

The timing of unload inactive state stores, happens when we get to load active state store provider at executors. At the time, state store coordinator will return back the state store provider list including loaded stores that are already loaded by other executors in new batch. Each state store provider in the list will go to unload.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPer the discussion at #30770, it makes sense to me we should unload inactive state store asap. Now we run a maintenance task periodically to unload inactive state stores. So there will be some delays between a state store becomes inactive and it is unloaded.\r\n\r\nHowever, we can force Spark to always allocate a state store to same executor, by using task locality configuration. This can reduce the possibility to have inactive state store.\r\n\r\nNormally, with locality configuration, we might not able to see inactive state store generally. There is still chance an executor can be failed and reallocated, but in this case, inactive state store is also lost too. So it is not an issue.\r\n\r\nMaking driver-executor bi-directional for unloading inactive state store looks non-trivial, and seems to me, it is not worth, after considering what we can do with locality.\r\n\r\nThis proposes a simpler but effective approach. We can check if loaded state store is already loaded at other executor during reporting active state store to the coordinator. If so, it means the loaded store is inactive now, and it is going to be unload by the next maintenance task. Then we unload that store immediately.\r\n\r\nHow do we make sure the loaded state store in previous batch is loaded at other executor in this batch before reporting in this executor? With task locality and preferred location, once an executor is ready to be scheduled, Spark should assign the state store provider previously loaded at the executor. So when this executor gets a new assignment other than previously loaded state store, it means the previously loaded one is already assigned to other executor.\r\n\r\nThere is still a delay between the state store is loaded at other executor, and unloading it when reporting active state store at this executor. But it should be minimized now. And there won't be multiple state store belonging to same operator are loaded at the same time at one single executor, because once the executor reports any active store, it will unload all inactive stores. This should not be an issue IMHO.\r\n\r\nThis is a minimal change to unload inactive state store asap without significant change.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUse `local[2]` to let tasks launch at the same time. And change counters (`numOnTaskXXX`) to `AtomicInteger` type to ensure thread safe.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis test is added at SPARK-33088 and still flaky after the fix https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30072. See: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30728/checks?check_run_id=1557987642\r\n\r\nAnd it's easy to reproduce if you test it multiple times (e.g. 100) locally.\r\n\r\nThe test sets up a stage with 2 tasks to run on an executor with 1 core. So these 2 tasks have to be launched one by one. \r\nThe task-2 will be launched after task-1 fails. However, since we don't retry failed task in local mode  (MAX_LOCAL_TASK_FAILURES = 1), the stage will abort right away after task-1 fail and cancels the running task-2 at the same time. There's a chance that task-2 gets canceled before calling `PluginContainer.onTaskStart`, which leads to the test failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTested manually after the fix and the test is no longer

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Add the boolean flag `purge` to `dropPartition()` in `SupportsPartitionManagement` and `dropPartitions()` in `SupportsAtomicPartitionManagement`.\r\n2. Propagate the parameter from the logical `command` to V2 exec node and further to catalog implementations.\r\n3. Remove the default implementations of dropping partitions from the `SupportsPartitionManagement` and `SupportsAtomicPartitionManagement` interfaces.\r\n4. Update Java docs for `dropTable`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe sql statement `ALTER TABLE .. DROP PARTITION` allows to specify the `PURGE` flag but it is ignored by v2 implementation. We should propagate it at least to `SupportsPartitionManagement` and to `SupportsAtomicPartitionManagement`, and let to implementations of those interface decide how to support it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nShould not.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new UT:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

So, this difference can make the distribution requirement check fail in `EnsureRequirements`:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/1e85707738a830d33598ca267a6740b3f06b1861/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/exchange/EnsureRequirements.scala#L47-L50\r\n\r\nThe `Cast` class that does not have a `timeZoneId` field is generated in the `HashJoin` object. To fix this issue, this PR proposes to use the `CastSupport.cast` method there.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to migrate `ALTER TABLE ... SET [SERDE|SERDEPROPERTIES` to use `UnresolvedTable` to resolve the table identifier. This allows consistent resolution rules (temp view first, etc.) to be applied for both v1/v2 commands. More info about the consistent resolution rule proposal can be found in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900) or [proposal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvLjGA8y_W_hhilpngXVub1Ebv8RsMap986nENCFnrg/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\nNote that `ALTER TABLE ... SET [SERDE|SERDEPROPERTIES]` is not supported for v2 tables.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe PR makes the resolution consistent behavior consistent. For example,\r\n```scala\r\nsql(\"CREATE DATABASE test\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE spark_catalog.test.t (id bigint, val string) USING csv PARTITIONED BY (id)\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW t AS SELECT 2\")\r\nsql(\"USE spark_catalog.test\")\r\nsql(\"ALTER TABLE t SET SERDE 'serdename'\") // works fine\r\n```\r\n, but after this PR:\r\n```\r\nsql(\"ALTER TABLE t SET SERDE 'serdename'\")\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: t is a temp view. 'ALTER TABLE ... SET [SERDE|SERDEPROPERTIES\\' expects a table; line 1 pos 0\r\n```\r\n, which is the consistent behavior with other commands.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nAfter this PR, `t` in the above example is resolved to a temp view first instead of `spark_catalog.test.t`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nStateful operators in SS provides preferred locations on the previous batches if any. However, if there is no previous batch to follow, Spark possibly schedules stateful tasks in inefficient distribution. In local test, Spark has scheduled stateful tasks to a few ones among all executors.\r\n\r\nThis is because when the first batch takes payload from latest offsets, this batch possibly finishes very quick. An executor might be assigned more than one task because the executor finishes previous task very quickly and becomes available again.\r\n\r\nGenerally this is not a problem. It doesn't mater these tasks are evenly distributed or not, because the tasks are finished very quickly. But for SS stateful tasks, next batches will choose task locations of previous batch. So this is why this is an issue only for SS.\r\n\r\nAs stateful operations probably need to maintain large state stores, it means large memory usage. A skew state store distribution possibly causes one or few executors to have memory usage times more than others. So it means the streaming query could be OOM on these executors, even there are other executors are still available for state stores.\r\n\r\nIt is better we distribute stateful tasks across all executors evenly. This patch proposes to provide preferred locations for stateful operations even there is no reported state store locations.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\n1. This proposes to leverage existing preferred locations to have evenly initial state store locations. We already leverage it to have state store on same locations in existing implementation.\r\n2. It is required to avoid uneven resource (memory, disk) requirement on executors.\r\n3. It is also required to have stable state store locations across executors with locality setting.\r\n4. Looks no other feasible approaches without making major change. Any major change can also possibly be regression for non-streaming jobs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces a VectorizedBLAS class which implements such hardware-accelerated BLAS operations. This feature is hidden behind the \"jvm-vectorized\" profile that you can enable by passing \"-Pjvm-vectorized\" to sbt or maven.\r\n\r\nThe Vector API has been introduced in JDK 16. Following discussion on the mailing list, this API is introduced transparently and needs to be enabled explicitely.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhenever a native BLAS implementation isn't available on the system, Spark automatically falls back onto a Java implementation. With the recent release of the Vector API in the OpenJDK [1], we can use hardware acceleration for such operations.\r\n\r\nThis change was also discussed on the mailing list. [2]\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt introduces a build-time profile called `jvm-vectorized`. You can pass it to sbt and mvn with `-Pjvm-vectorized`. There is no change to the end-user of Spark and it should only impact Spark developpers. It is also disabled by default.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt passes `build/sbt mllib-local/test` with and without `-Pjvm-vectorized` with JDK 16. This patch also introduces benchmarks for BLAS. \r\n\r\nThe benchmark results are as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] daxpy:                                    Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)

To work around it, Spark split the schema json string into several parts when saving to hive metastore as table properties. We need to do the same for histogram column stats as it can go very big.\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors the table property splitting code, so that we can share it between the schema json string and histogram column stats.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[The PySpark documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.1/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#pyspark.sql.DataFrame.join) says \"Must be one of: inner, cross, outer, full, fullouter, full_outer, left, leftouter, left_outer, right, rightouter, right_outer, semi, leftsemi, left_semi, anti, leftanti and left_anti.\"\r\nHowever, I get the following error when I set the cross option.\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> val df1 = spark.createDataFrame(Seq((1,\"a\"),(2,\"b\")))\r\ndf1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [_1: int, _2: string]\r\n\r\nscala> val df2 = spark.createDataFrame(Seq((1,\"A\"),(2,\"B\"), (3, \"C\")))\r\ndf2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [_1: int, _2: string]\r\n\r\nscala> df1.join(right = df2, usingColumns = Seq(\"_1\"), joinType = \"cross\").show()\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: requirement failed: Unsupported using join type Cross\r\n  at scala.Predef$.require(Predef.scala:281)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.UsingJoin.<init>(joinTypes.scala:106)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset.join(Dataset.scala:1025)\r\n  ... 53 elided\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe documentation says cross option can be set, but when I try to set it, I get an java.lang.IllegalArgumentException.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nAccepting this PR fix will behave the same as the documentation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThere is already a test for [JoinTypes](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/1b9fd67904671ea08526bfb7a97d694815d47665/sql/catalyst/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/plans/JoinTypesTest.scala), but I can't find a test for the join option

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThrow `NoSuchPartitionsException` from `ALTER TABLE .. DROP PARTITION` for not existing partitions of a table in V1 Hive external catalog.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe behaviour of Hive external catalog deviates from V1/V2 in-memory catalogs that throw `NoSuchPartitionsException`. To improve user experience with Spark SQL, it would be better to throw the same exception. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the command throws `NoSuchPartitionsException` instead of the general exception `AnalysisException`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new UT via:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver

of: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30783\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR introduces a helper method `withExecutor` that handles the creation of an Executor object and ensures that it is always stopped in a finally block. The tests in ExecutorSuite have been refactored to use this method.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRecently an issue was discovered that leaked Executors (which are not explicitly stopped after a test) can cause other tests to fail due to the JVM being killed after 10 min. It is therefore crucial that tests always stop the Executor. By introducing this helper method, a simple pattern is established that can be easily adopted in new tests, which reduces the risk of regressions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRun the ExecutorSuite locally.","created_at":"2020-12-16T10:36:40Z","updated_at":"2020-12-16T16:09:09Z","closed_at":"2020-12-16T14:33:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2b2bba3d6e1ef5754037fa20e6e1ef8aa74862ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30801/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30801/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30801/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8e04da0dc6bd47d5e083143edaefd94bc54bf785","head":{"label":"sander-goos:SPARK-33793-close-executors-3.0","ref":"SPARK-33793-close-executors-3.0","sha":"8e04da0dc6bd47d5e083143edaefd94bc54bf785","user":{"login":"sander-goos","id":69472612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDcyNjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69472612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos","html_url":"https://github.com/sander-goos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":321677363,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjE2NzczNjM=","name":"spark","full_name":"sander-goos/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sander-goos","id":69472612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDcyNjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69472612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos","html_url":"https://github.com/sander-goos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sander-goos/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt seems a very popular way that people use DISTRIBUTE BY clause with a literal to coalesce partition in the pure SQL data processing.\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n```\r\ninsert into table src select * from values (1), (2), (3) t(a) distribute by 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsers may want the final output to be one single data file, but if the reality is not always true. Spark will always create a file for partition 0 whether it contains data or not, so when the data all goes to a partition(IDX >0), there will be always 2 files there and the part-00000 is empty. On the other hand, a lot of empty tasks will be launched too, this is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nWhen users repeat the insert statement daily, hourly, or minutely, it causes small file issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> set spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=3;drop table if exists test2;create table test2 using parquet as select * from values (1), (2), (3) t(a) distribute by 1;\r\n\r\n\r\n kentyao@hulk  ~/spark   SPARK-33806  tree /Users/kentyao/Downloads/spark/spark-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT-bin-20201202/spark-warehouse/test2/ -s\r\n/Users/kentyao/Downloads/spark/spark-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT-bin-20201202/spark-warehouse/test2/\r\n├── [          0]  _SUCCESS\r\n├── [        298]  part-00000-5dc19733-9405-414b-9681-d25c4d3e9ee6-c000.snappy.parquet\r\n└── [        426]  part-00001-5dc19733-9405-414b-9681-d25c4d3e9ee6-c000.snappy.parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, there are some options you can take.\r\n\r\n1. use `distribute by null`, let the data go to the partition 0\r\n2. set spark.sql.adaptive.enabled to true for Spark to automatically coalesce\r\n3. using hints instead of `distribute by`\r\n4. set spark.sql.shuffle.partitions to 1\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we set the partition number to 1 in this particular case.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. avoid small file issues\r\n2. avoid unnecessary empty tasks when no adaptive execution\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

well:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e3058ba17cb4512537953eb4ded884e24ee93ba2/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/v2/DescribeTableExec.scala#L63\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the test case in Scala 2.13 build as well where the table properties have different order in the map.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo keep the deterministic and pretty output, and fix the tests in Scala 2.13 build.\r\nSee https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/spark-master-test-maven-hadoop-3.2-scala-2.13/49/testReport/junit/org.apache.spark.sql/SQLQueryTestSuite/describe_sql/\r\n\r\n```\r\ndescribe.sql&#010;Expected \"...spark_catalog, view.[query.out.col.2=c, view.referredTempFunctionsNames=[], view.catalogAndNamespace.part.1=default]]\", but got \"...spark_catalog, view.[catalogAndNamespace.part.1=default, view.query.out.col.2=c, view.referredTempFunctionsNames=[]]]\" Result did not match for query #29&#010;DESC FORMATTED v\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it will change the text output from `DESCRIBE [EXTENDED|FORMATTED] table_name`.\r\nNow the table properties are sorted by its key.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRelated unittests were fixed accordingly.","created_at":"2020-12-16T08:18:12Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:55:40Z","closed_at":"2020-12-16T13:43:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bc8ce0a4d00b9b2ca6fe40af2bdb69984641267a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30799/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30799/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30799/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2e908def417f933a993972110df86a43ec0b2f73","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-33803","ref":"SPARK-33803","sha":"2e908def417f933a993972110df86a43ec0b2f73","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to handle exclusion events in `ExecutorMonitor` so it doesn't count excluded executors as available executors for running tasks.\r\n\r\nThe main change includes:\r\n* implement `onExecutorExcluded`/`onExecutorUnexcluded`/`onNodeExcluded`/`onNodeUnexcluded` insides `ExecutorMonitor`.\r\n* Allow the `ExecutorAllocationManager` to request at most (`maxNumExecutors` + `excludeExecutors`)\r\n\r\nNote that this improvement only tasks effects when both dynamic allocation and exclusion features are enabled but with  `spark.excludeOnFailure.killExcludedExecutors=false`. We don't want to handle the exclude executors specifically when we do kill excluded executors. Because in that case, we assume that there would be new executors launched later to replace those killed executors.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, the excluded executors are counted as available executors for running tasks. But that's not correct since the `TaskScheduler` never schedules tasks on those excluded executors. As a result, it can lower the scheduling efficiency of the `TaskScheduler`. In the worst case, the TaskSet can not be scheduled anywhere and it then has to go through `getCompletelyExcludedTaskIfAny(...)` path which is inefficient. \r\n\r\nThis PR makes the Spark be aware of the lack of executors at dynamic allocation level. So we can launch the new executors early before the `TaskScheduler` realizes the problem, which could ease the worst case and improve scheduling efficiency.\r\n\r\nBesides, this also prevents the `ExecutorAllocationManager` from going into the fake `minExecutor` status when removing idle executors. For example, when we have 5 executors (2 excluded) and minExecutor=3, and we need to remove 2 idle but not exluded executors. Then, we'd have 3 executors with 2 excluded executor at the end and only one executor can launch tasks indeed.  (this worths a followup to kill the idle-exclude-executor first if this PR gets approved). And this PR could avoid the problem since we'd remove the excluded executors in first place.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nBased on the discussion https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30743#discussion_r543124594, this PR proposes to remove the command name in AnalysisException message when a relation is not resolved.\r\n\r\nFor some of the commands that use `UnresolvedTable`, `UnresolvedView`, and `UnresolvedTableOrView` to resolve an identifier, when the identifier cannot be resolved, the exception will be something like `Table or view not found for 'SHOW TBLPROPERTIES': badtable`. The command name (`SHOW TBLPROPERTIES` in this case) should be dropped to be consistent with other existing commands.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make the exception message consistent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the exception message will be changed from\r\n```\r\nTable or view not found for 'SHOW TBLPROPERTIES': badtable\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\nTable or view not found: badtable\r\n```\r\nfor commands that use `UnresolvedTable`, `UnresolvedView`, and `UnresolvedTableOrView` to resolve an identifier.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a back port of #30774.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to retain the cache's storage level when a table name is altered by `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO ...`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, when a table name is altered, the table's cache is refreshed (if exists), but the storage level is not retained. For example:\r\n```scala\r\n        def getStorageLevel(tableName: String): StorageLevel = {\r\n          val table = spark.table(tableName)\r\n          val cachedData = spark.sharedState.cacheManager.lookupCachedData(table).get\r\n          cachedData.cachedRepresentation.cacheBuilder.storageLevel\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        Seq(1 -> \"a\").toDF(\"i\", \"j\").write.parquet(path.getCanonicalPath)\r\n        sql(s\"CREATE TABLE old USING parquet LOCATION '${path.toURI}'\")\r\n        sql(\"CACHE TABLE old OPTIONS('storageLevel' 'MEMORY_ONLY')\")\r\n        val oldStorageLevel = getStorageLevel(\"old\")\r\n\r\n        sql(\"ALTER TABLE old RENAME TO new\")\r\n        val newStorageLevel = getStorageLevel(\"new\")\r\n```\r\n`oldStorageLevel` will be `StorageLevel(memory, deserialized, 1 replicas)` whereas `newStorageLevel` will be `StorageLevel(disk, memory, deserialized, 1 replicas)`, which is the default storage level.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now the storage level for the cache will be retained.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `RowBasedKeyValueBatch` has two different implementations depending on whether the aggregation key and value uses only fixed length data types (`FixedLengthRowBasedKeyValueBatch`) or not (`VariableLengthRowBasedKeyValueBatch`).\r\n\r\nBefore this PR the decision about the used implementation was based on by accessing the schema fields by their name.\r\nBut if two fields has the same name and one with variable length and the other with fixed length type (and all the other fields are with fixed length types) a bad decision could be made.\r\n\r\nWhen `FixedLengthRowBasedKeyValueBatch` is chosen but there is a variable length field then an aggregation function could calculate with invalid values. This case is illustrated by the example used in the unit test:\r\n\r\n`with T as (select id as a, -id as x from range(3)), \r\n        U as (select id as b, cast(id as string) as x from range(3)) \r\nselect T.x, U.x, min(a) as ma, min(b) as mb from T join U on a=b group by U.x, T.x`\r\nwhere the 'x' column in the left side of the join is a Long but on the right side is a String.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFixes the issue where duplicate field name aggregation has null values in the dataframe.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen creating table like this:\r\n`create table test_orc(c1 string) row format delimited fields terminated by '002' stored as orcfile;`\r\nspark throws exception like :\r\n`Operation not allowed: ROW FORMAT DELIMITED is only compatible with 'textfile', not 'orcfile'(line 2, pos 0)`\r\n\r\nIn this pr, we support non-strict rules when creating orc table with row format delimited.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nI found this problem when migrating task from hive to spark. Hive is supported (It's not good, but it's not a problem, we can ignore it). So I fixed it in version Spark 2.4. Although Orc doesn't need this delimiter, but I don't think we need to be so strict in syntax. It is more convenient to migrate tasks from hive to spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUTs to be

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSimilar to SPARK-33441, this pr add `unused-import` check to Maven compilation process. After this pr `unused-import` will trigger Maven compilation error.\r\n\r\nFor Scala 2.13 profile, this pr also left TODO(SPARK-33499) similar to SPARK-33441 because `scala.language.higherKinds` no longer needs to be imported explicitly since Scala 2.13.1\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nLet Maven build also check for unused imports as compilation error.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n\r\n- Local manual test：add an unused import intentionally to trigger maven compilation error.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-15T14:34:34Z","updated_at":"2022-06-06T03:45:28Z","closed_at":"2020-12-26T23:40:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c0f7ee029e3919e461a3126fbbd840066df146ab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR introduces a helper method `withExecutor` that handles the creation of an Executor object and ensures that it is always stopped in a finally block. The tests in ExecutorSuite have been refactored to use this method.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRecently an issue was discovered that leaked Executors (which are not explicitly stopped after a test) can cause other tests to fail due to the JVM being killed after 10 min. It is therefore crucial that tests always stop the Executor. By introducing this helper method, a simple pattern is established that can be easily adopted in new tests, which reduces the risk of regressions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRun the ExecutorSuite locally.\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-15T14:20:49Z","updated_at":"2020-12-16T10:42:38Z","closed_at":"2020-12-16T02:27:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"991576ec473c5bb92beb34ba11385dcf43e9586e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30783/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30783/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30783/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/87faa5ae8576d7df574e3e4032ad3dde7f2ab044","head":{"label":"sander-goos:SPARK-33793-close-executors","ref":"SPARK-33793-close-executors","sha":"87faa5ae8576d7df574e3e4032ad3dde7f2ab044","user":{"login":"sander-goos","id":69472612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDcyNjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69472612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos","html_url":"https://github.com/sander-goos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":321677363,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjE2NzczNjM=","name":"spark","full_name":"sander-goos/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sander-goos","id":69472612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDcyNjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69472612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos","html_url":"https://github.com/sander-goos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sander-goos/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSee SPARK-22748,  sql like:\r\n```\r\ncreate table temp.test_grouping_replace(a int, b int);\r\nselect grouping__id from (select a, b, count(1) , grouping__id from temp.test_grouping_replace group by a, b grouping sets(a, b))\r\n```\r\nwill raise an error like\r\n\r\n> Error in query: grouping_id() can only be used with GroupingSets/Cube/Rollup;;\r\n\r\nThis is because Spark translate grouping__id to grouping_id() every when it occurs, actually the 'grouping__id' in outer query is only a attribute reference to inner query, not a new function.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAlthough user can add alias to avoid this problem, but since fix this problem is not difficult, I guess we should fix it to make user use spark easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew Test added in AnalysisSuite\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-15T13:19:11Z","updated_at":"2021-03-05T07:41:09Z","closed_at":"2021-03-05T07:41:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a5f43839c681b9115e725f2a5f7701349eb2a0f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30781/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30781/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30781/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ebddbb219270a3d4df652f0942145b88e0c000dc","head":{"label":"sqlwindspeaker:fix_grouping_id_bug","ref":"fix_grouping_id_bug","sha":"ebddbb219270a3d4df652f0942145b88e0c000dc","user":{"login":"sqlwindspeaker","id":3691551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3691551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlwindspeaker","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlwindspeaker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlwindspeaker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlwindspeaker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlwindspeaker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlwindspeaker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlwindspeaker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlwindspeaker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlwindspeaker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlwindspeaker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlwindspeaker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":318753185,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTg3NTMxODU=","name":"spark","full_name":"sqlwindspeaker/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sqlwindspeaker","id":3691551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3691551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlwindspeaker","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlwindspeaker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlwindspeaker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlwindspeaker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlwindspeaker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlwindspeaker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlwindspeaker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlwindspeaker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlwindspeaker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlwindspeaker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlwindspeaker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sqlwindspeaker/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThrow `NoSuchPartitionsException` from `ALTER TABLE .. DROP TABLE` for not existing partitions of a table in V1 Hive external catalog.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe behaviour of Hive external catalog deviates from V1/V2 in-memory catalogs that throw `NoSuchPartitionsException`. To improve user experience with Spark SQL, it would be better to throw the same exception. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the command throws `NoSuchPartitionsException` instead of the general exception `AnalysisException`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running tests for `ALTER TABLE .. DROP PARTITION`:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIt's a known issue that re-analyzing an optimized plan can lead to various issues. We made several attempts to avoid it from happening, but the current solution `AlreadyOptimized` is still not 100% safe, as people can inject catalyst rules to call analyzer directly.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a simpler and safer idea: we set the `analyzed` flag to true after optimization, and analyzer will skip processing plans whose `analyzed` flag is true.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nmake the code simpler and safer\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd default methods `dropPartition()` in `SupportsPartitionManagement` and `dropPartitions()` in `SupportsAtomicPartitionManagement()` with the `purge` parameter. Also, propagate the parameter from the logical `command` to V2 exec node and further to catalog implementations.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe sql statement `ALTER TABLE .. DROP PARTITION` allows to specify the `PURGE` flag but it is ignored by v2 implementation. We should propagate it at least to `SupportsPartitionManagement` and to `SupportsAtomicPartitionManagement`, and let to implementations of those interface decide how to support it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nShould not.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UT to `v2.AlterTableDropPartitionSuite`.","created_at":"2020-12-15T07:51:33Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T15:04:44Z","closed_at":"2020-12-23T09:10:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7b2cfcbe7766819fe96a99364310449cc8ea2cf8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30776/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30776/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30776/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/26aed5a36b18d6d6519b62c0d37e6253926780c6","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:purge-drop-partition-v2","ref":"purge-drop-partition-v2","sha":"26aed5a36b18d6d6519b62c0d37e6253926780c6","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to retain the cache's storage level when a table name is altered by `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO ...`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, when a table name is altered, the table's cache is refreshed (if exists), but the storage level is not retained. For example:\r\n```scala\r\n        def getStorageLevel(tableName: String): StorageLevel = {\r\n          val table = spark.table(tableName)\r\n          val cachedData = spark.sharedState.cacheManager.lookupCachedData(table).get\r\n          cachedData.cachedRepresentation.cacheBuilder.storageLevel\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        Seq(1 -> \"a\").toDF(\"i\", \"j\").write.parquet(path.getCanonicalPath)\r\n        sql(s\"CREATE TABLE old USING parquet LOCATION '${path.toURI}'\")\r\n        sql(\"CACHE TABLE old OPTIONS('storageLevel' 'MEMORY_ONLY')\")\r\n        val oldStorageLevel = getStorageLevel(\"old\")\r\n\r\n        sql(\"ALTER TABLE old RENAME TO new\")\r\n        val newStorageLevel = getStorageLevel(\"new\")\r\n```\r\n`oldStorageLevel` will be `StorageLevel(memory, deserialized, 1 replicas)` whereas `newStorageLevel` will be `StorageLevel(disk, memory, deserialized, 1 replicas)`, which is the default storage level.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now the storage level for the cache will be retained.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a unit test.","created_at":"2020-12-15T03:52:55Z","updated_at":"2020-12-16T08:24:20Z","closed_at":"2020-12-16T05:45:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a7ea028f92ea6b4097fa129c1a2f60eb657d286b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30774/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30774/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30774/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/11603d54d4a6b222edc2c5dbd4755e3a1e9072a2","head":{"label":"imback82:alter_table_rename_cache_fix","ref":"alter_table_rename_cache_fix","sha":"11603d54d4a6b222edc2c5dbd4755e3a1e9072a2","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to migrate `ALTER TABLE ... RECOVER PARTITIONS` to use `UnresolvedTable` to resolve the table identifier. This allows consistent resolution rules (temp view first, etc.) to be applied for both v1/v2 commands. More info about the consistent resolution rule proposal can be found in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900) or [proposal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvLjGA8y_W_hhilpngXVub1Ebv8RsMap986nENCFnrg/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\nNote that `ALTER TABLE ... RECOVER PARTITIONS` is not supported for v2 tables.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe PR makes the resolution consistent behavior consistent. For example,\r\n```scala\r\nsql(\"CREATE DATABASE test\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE spark_catalog.test.t (id bigint, val string) USING csv PARTITIONED BY (id)\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW t AS SELECT 2\")\r\nsql(\"USE spark_catalog.test\")\r\nsql(\"ALTER TABLE t RECOVER PARTITIONS\") // works fine\r\n```\r\n, but after this PR:\r\n```\r\nsql(\"ALTER TABLE t RECOVER PARTITIONS\")\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: t is a temp view. 'ALTER TABLE ... RECOVER PARTITIONS' expects a table; line 1 pos 0\r\n```\r\n, which is the consistent behavior with other commands.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nAfter this PR, `ALTER TABLE t RECOVER PARTITIONS` in the above example is resolved to a temp view `t` first instead of `spark_catalog.test.t`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-15T02:07:21Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T05:24:02Z","closed_at":"2020-12-15T05:24:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2af071528ec06812f1ab53de8674f472d5d9dd76","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30773/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30773/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30773/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/852e1692413e82747761e91a74c49e5a228ebc6e","head":{"label":"imback82:alter_table_recover_part_v2","ref":"alter_table_recover_part_v2","sha":"852e1692413e82747761e91a74c49e5a228ebc6e","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

So it is said one state store provider might be unloaded immediately after it becomes inactive because the maintenance task is asynchronous. \r\n\r\nSo it is possible some stores are unloaded earilier and others are later. The inconsistent unloading behavior makes harder to estimate query behavior.\r\n\r\nIt is also inefficient as the state store provider could be reused in next batches and we should be able to have more control of unloading behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, users can use the added configuration to change the time an inactive state store provider can keep alive.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

Then, the main thread can't generate the following initialization statements.\r\n```\r\n           |$isNull = ${ev.isNull};\r\n           |$value = ${ev.value};\r\n         \"\"\".stripMargin\r\n```\r\nSo, the variable represented by `isNull` is `false` as the default value and the other variable represented by `value` is `0`.\r\nThis is why `min` can generate wrong results.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a serious correctness issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI confirmed that `ExprCode#code` for the main thread is no longer consumed by the subquery thread using

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIf we call `SubqueryExec.executeTake`, it will call `SubqueryExec.execute` which will trigger the codegen of the query plan and create an RDD. However, `SubqueryExec` already has a thread (`SubqueryExec.relationFuture`) to execute the query plan, which means we have 2 threads triggering codegen of the same query plan at the same time.\r\n\r\nSpark codegen is not thread-safe, as we have places like `HashAggregateExec.bufferVars` that is a shared variable. The bug in `SubqueryExec` may lead to correctness bugs.\r\n\r\nSince https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-33119, `ScalarSubquery` will call `SubqueryExec.executeTake`, so flaky tests start to appear.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the bug by reimplementing https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30016 . We should pass the number of rows we want to collect to `SubqueryExec` at planning time, so that we can use `executeTake` inside `SubqueryExec.relationFuture`, and the caller side should always call `SubqueryExec.executeCollect`. This PR also adds checks so that we can make sure only `SubqueryExec.executeCollect` is called.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nfix correctness bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nrun `build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *SQLQueryTestSuite  -- -z scalar-subquery-select\"` more than 10 times.

is a copy of #28618 but merged with the current master resolving all the merge conflicts. \r\nAll the credit goes to @mccheah I just would like to help out here and avoid his progress to be lost. \r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds a `ShuffleOutputTracker` API that can be used for managing shuffle metadata on the driver. Accepts map output metadata returned by the map output writers.\r\n\r\nRequires #28616.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPart of the design as discussed in this document, and part of the wider effort of SPARK-25299.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nEnables additional APIs for the shuffle storage plugin tree. Usage will become more apparent when the read side of the shuffle plugin tree is introduced.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWe've added a mock implementation of the shuffle plugin tree here, to prove that a Spark job using a different implementation of the plugin can use all of the plugin points for an alternative shuffle data storage solution. But we don't include it here, in order to minimize the diff and the code to review in this specific patch.

#28902.","created_at":"2020-12-14T13:26:24Z","updated_at":"2021-06-27T00:07:59Z","closed_at":"2021-06-27T00:07:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b00bb651f8cdc5accc17e42498d013fb1ab65038","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1984378631,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0Mzc4NjMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DSTREAM","name":"DSTREAM","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30763/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30763/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30763/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8e54b41702fd3f8f78d14a57eeb3cf9277b666cc","head":{"label":"attilapiros:updated_28618","ref":"updated_28618","sha":"8e54b41702fd3f8f78d14a57eeb3cf9277b666cc","user":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114023960,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQwMjM5NjA=","name":"spark","full_name":"attilapiros/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR tries to prune the unrequired output partitionings in cases when the columns are dropped from Project/Aggregates etc.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nConsider this query:\r\n    select t1.id from t1 JOIN t2 on t1.id = t2.id\r\n\r\nThis query will have top level Project node which will just project t1.id. But the outputPartitioning of this project node will be: PartitioningCollection(HashPartitioning(t1.id), HashPartitioning(t2.id)).\r\n\r\nBut since we are not propagating t2.id column, so we can drop HashPartitioning(t2.id) from the output partitioning of Project node.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe proposition of this pull request is described in this JIRA ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-33769\r\n\r\nIt proposes to improve the next-day function of the sql component to deal with Column type for the parameter dayOfWeek.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt makes this functionality easier to use.\r\nActually the signature of this function is:\r\n> def next_day(date: Column, dayOfWeek: String): Column.\r\n\r\nIt accepts the dayOfWeek parameter as a String. However in some cases, the dayOfWeek is in a Column, so a different value for each row of the dataframe.\r\nA current workaround is to use the NextDay function like this:\r\n> NextDay(dateCol.expr, dayOfWeekCol.expr).\r\n\r\nThe proposition is to add another signature for this function:\r\n> def next_day(date: Column, dayOfWeek: Column): Column\r\n\r\nIn fact it is already the case for some other functions in this scala object, exemple:\r\n> def date_sub(start: Column, days: Int): Column = date_sub(start, lit(days))\r\n> def date_sub(start: Column, days: Column): Column = withExpr \\{ DateSub(start.expr, days.expr) }\r\n\r\nor  \r\n\r\n> def add_months(startDate: Column, numMonths: Int): Column = add_months(startDate, lit(numMonths))\r\n> def add_months(startDate: Column, numMonths: Column): Column = withExpr {\r\n>  AddMonths(startDate.expr, numMonths.expr)\r\n>  }\r\n\r\nThis pull request is the same idea for the function next_day.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes\r\nWith this pull request, users of spark will have a new signature of the function:\r\n> def next_day(date: Column, dayOfWeek: Column): Column\r\n\r\nBut the existing function signature should still work:\r\n> def next_day(date: Column, dayOfWeek: String): Column\r\n\r\nSo this change should be retrocompatible.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nThe unit tests of the next_day function has been enhanced.\r\nIt tests the dayOfWeek parameter both as String and Column.\r\nI also added a test case for the existing signature where the dayOfWeek is a non valid String. This should return null.","created_at":"2020-12-14T11:14:04Z","updated_at":"2020-12-16T13:34:37Z","closed_at":"2020-12-15T09:56:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8d93115ceb8b27674decdf390ba35c30530e3f6d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30761/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30761/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30761/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7c32905643ec1e072f82936d429a8e445e365356","head":{"label":"chongguang:SPARK-33769","ref":"SPARK-33769","sha":"7c32905643ec1e072f82936d429a8e445e365356","user":{"login":"chongguang","id":3393189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTMxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3393189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chongguang","html_url":"https://github.com/chongguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chongguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chongguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chongguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chongguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chongguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chongguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chongguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chongguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chongguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":136540966,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzY1NDA5NjY=","name":"spark","full_name":"chongguang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chongguang","id":3393189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTMxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3393189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chongguang","html_url":"https://github.com/chongguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chongguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chongguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chongguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chongguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chongguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chongguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chongguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chongguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chongguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chongguang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are too many compilation warnings in Scala 2.13, this pr add some `-Wconf:msg= regexes` rules to `SparkBuild.scala` to suppress compilation warnings and the suppressed will not be printed to the console.\r\n\r\nThe suppressed compilation warnings includes:\r\n\r\n- All warnings related to `method\\value\\type\\object\\trait\\inheritance` deprecated since 2.13\r\n\r\n- All warnings related to `Widening conversion from XXX to YYY is deprecated because it loses precision`\r\n\r\n- Auto-application to `()` is deprecated. Supply the empty argument list `()` explicitly to invoke method `methodName`, or remove the empty argument list from its definition (Java-defined methods are exempt).In Scala 3, an unapplied method like this will be eta-expanded into a function.\r\n\r\n- method with a single empty parameter list overrides method without any parameter list\r\n\r\n- method without a parameter list overrides a method with a single empty one\r\n\r\nNot suppressed compilation warnings includes:\r\n\r\n- Unicode escapes in triple quoted strings are deprecated, use the literal character instead.\r\n\r\n- view bounds are deprecated\r\n\r\n- symbol literal is deprecated\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSuppress unimportant compilation warnings in Scala 2.13\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce

If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nInitiate the `masterWebUiUrl` with the `webUi. webUrl` instead of the `masterPublicAddress`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSince [SPARK-21642](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21642), `WebUI` has changed from `localHostName` to `localCanonicalHostName` as the hostname to set up the web UI. However, the `masterPublicAddress` is from `RpcEnv`'s host address, which still uses `localHostName`. As a result, it returns the wrong Master web URL to the Worker. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, when users click \"Back to Master\" in the Worker page:\r\n\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"3258\" alt=\"WeChat4acbfd163f51c76a5f9bc388c7479785\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16397174/102057951-b9664280-3e29-11eb-8749-5ee293902bdf.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter this PR:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16397174/102058016-d438b700-3e29-11eb-8641-a23a6b2f542e.png)\r\n\r\n(Return to the Master page successfully.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTested manually.\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-14T08:32:59Z","updated_at":"2020-12-18T02:40:59Z","closed_at":"2020-12-17T14:52:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"216abcd5fb13fa6f4134815cf1f8591f36af2609","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30759/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30759/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30759/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/df2953ec29f7b8be205959437f9b2d0637813cbf","head":{"label":"Ngone51:fix-back-to-master","ref":"fix-back-to-master","sha":"df2953ec29f7b8be205959437f9b2d0637813cbf","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

In that case, `ALTER TABLE .. DROP PARTITION` tries to access (delete) folder out of the \"base\" path in `LOCATION`.\r\n\r\nThe problem belongs to Hive's MetaStore method `drop_partition_common`: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hive/blob/8696c82d07d303b6dbb69b4d443ab6f2b241b251/standalone-metastore/metastore-server/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/HiveMetaStore.java#L4876\r\nwhich tries to delete empty partition sub-folders recursively starting from the most deeper partition sub-folder up to the base folder. In the case when the number of sub-folder is not equal to the number of partitioned columns `part_vals.size()`, the method will try to list and delete folders out of the base path.  \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix test failures like https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30643#issuecomment-743774733:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.command.AlterTableAddPartitionSuite.ALTER TABLE ..

Create a base folder, for example: `/Users/maximgekk/tmp/part-location`\r\n2. Create a sub-folder in the base folder and drop permissions for it:\r\n```\r\n$ mkdir /Users/maximgekk/tmp/part-location/aaa\r\n$ chmod a-rwx chmod a-rwx /Users/maximgekk/tmp/part-location/aaa\r\n$ ls -al /Users/maximgekk/tmp/part-location\r\ntotal 0\r\ndrwxr-xr-x   3 maximgekk  staff    96 Dec 13 18:42 .\r\ndrwxr-xr-x  33 maximgekk  staff  1056 Dec 13 18:32 ..\r\nd---------   2 maximgekk  staff    64 Dec 13 18:42 aaa\r\n```\r\n3. Create a table with a partition folder in the base folder:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> create table tbl (id int) partitioned by (part0 int, part1 int);\r\nspark-sql> alter table tbl add partition (part0=1,part1=2) location '/Users/maximgekk/tmp/part-location/tbl';\r\n``` \r\n4. Try to drop this partition:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> alter table tbl drop partition (part0=1,part1=2);\r\n20/12/13 18:46:07 ERROR HiveClientImpl:\r\n======================\r\nAttempt to drop the partition specs in table 'tbl' database 'default':\r\nMap(part0 -> 1, part1 -> 2)\r\nIn this attempt, the following partitions have been dropped successfully:\r\n\r\nThe remaining partitions have not been

`/Users/maximgekk/tmp/part-location/tbl`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected tests from local IDEA which

In that case, `ALTER TABLE .. DROP PARTITION` tries to access (delete) folder out of the \"base\" path in `LOCATION`.\r\n\r\nThe problem belongs to Hive's MetaStore method `drop_partition_common`: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hive/blob/8696c82d07d303b6dbb69b4d443ab6f2b241b251/standalone-metastore/metastore-server/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/HiveMetaStore.java#L4876\r\nwhich tries to delete empty partition sub-folders recursively starting from the most deeper partition sub-folder up to the base folder. In the case when the number of sub-folder is not equal to the number of partitioned columns `part_vals.size()`, the method will try to list and delete folders out of the base path.  \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix test failures like https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30643#issuecomment-743774733:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.command.AlterTableAddPartitionSuite.ALTER TABLE ..

Create a base folder, for example: `/Users/maximgekk/tmp/part-location`\r\n2. Create a sub-folder in the base folder and drop permissions for it:\r\n```\r\n$ mkdir /Users/maximgekk/tmp/part-location/aaa\r\n$ chmod a-rwx chmod a-rwx /Users/maximgekk/tmp/part-location/aaa\r\n$ ls -al /Users/maximgekk/tmp/part-location\r\ntotal 0\r\ndrwxr-xr-x   3 maximgekk  staff    96 Dec 13 18:42 .\r\ndrwxr-xr-x  33 maximgekk  staff  1056 Dec 13 18:32 ..\r\nd---------   2 maximgekk  staff    64 Dec 13 18:42 aaa\r\n```\r\n3. Create a table with a partition folder in the base folder:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> create table tbl (id int) partitioned by (part0 int, part1 int);\r\nspark-sql> alter table tbl add partition (part0=1,part1=2) location '/Users/maximgekk/tmp/part-location/tbl';\r\n``` \r\n4. Try to drop this partition:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> alter table tbl drop partition (part0=1,part1=2);\r\n20/12/13 18:46:07 ERROR HiveClientImpl:\r\n======================\r\nAttempt to drop the partition specs in table 'tbl' database 'default':\r\nMap(part0 -> 1, part1 -> 2)\r\nIn this attempt, the following partitions have been dropped successfully:\r\n\r\nThe remaining partitions have not been

`/Users/maximgekk/tmp/part-location/tbl`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected tests from local IDEA which

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes a better solution for the R build failure on GitHub Actions.\r\nThe issue is solved in #30737 but I noticed the following two things.\r\n\r\n* We can use the latest `usethis` if we install additional libraries on the GitHub Actions environment.\r\n* For tests on AppVeyor, `usethis` is not necessary, so I partially revert the previous change.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor more simple solution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nConfirmed on GitHub Actions and AppVeyor on my account.","created_at":"2020-12-13T23:46:53Z","updated_at":"2021-06-04T20:42:05Z","closed_at":"2020-12-14T01:27:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fcfd40a5985818571983a72205fc417bb0a95f4e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30753/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30753/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30753/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/28d164b42246f325890e3c5b5255e702cd0643c2","head":{"label":"sarutak:followup-SPARK-33757","ref":"followup-SPARK-33757","sha":"28d164b42246f325890e3c5b5255e702cd0643c2","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

In that case, `ALTER TABLE .. DROP PARTITION` tries to access (delete) folder out of the \"base\" path in `LOCATION`.\r\n\r\nThe problem belongs to Hive's MetaStore method `drop_partition_common`: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hive/blob/8696c82d07d303b6dbb69b4d443ab6f2b241b251/standalone-metastore/metastore-server/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/HiveMetaStore.java#L4876\r\nwhich tries to delete empty partition sub-folders recursively starting from the most deeper partition sub-folder up to the base folder. In the case when the number of sub-folder is not equal to the number of partitioned columns `part_vals.size()`, the method will try to list and delete folders out of the base path.  \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix test failures like https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30643#issuecomment-743774733:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.command.AlterTableAddPartitionSuite.ALTER TABLE .. ADD PARTITION Hive V1: SPARK-33521: universal type conversions of partition values\r\nsbt.ForkMain$ForkError: org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: File file:/home/jenkins/workspace/SparkPullRequestBuilder/target/tmp/spark-832cb19c-65fd-41f3-ae0b-937d76c07897 does not exist;\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveExternalCatalog.withClient(HiveExternalCatalog.scala:112)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveExternalCatalog.dropPartitions(HiveExternalCatalog.scala:1014)\r\n...\r\nCaused by: sbt.ForkMain$ForkError: org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.api.MetaException: File file:/home/jenkins/workspace/SparkPullRequestBuilder/target/tmp/spark-832cb19c-65fd-41f3-ae0b-937d76c07897 does not exist\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.HiveMetaStore$HMSHandler.drop_partition_with_environment_context(HiveMetaStore.java:3381)\r\n\tat sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor304.invoke(Unknown Source)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue can be reproduced by the following steps:\r\n1. Create a base folder, for example: `/Users/maximgekk/tmp/part-location`\r\n2. Create a sub-folder in the base folder and drop permissions for it:\r\n```\r\n$ mkdir /Users/maximgekk/tmp/part-location/aaa\r\n$ chmod a-rwx chmod a-rwx /Users/maximgekk/tmp/part-location/aaa\r\n$ ls -al /Users/maximgekk/tmp/part-location\r\ntotal 0\r\ndrwxr-xr-x   3 maximgekk  staff    96 Dec 13 18:42 .\r\ndrwxr-xr-x  33 maximgekk  staff  1056 Dec 13 18:32 ..\r\nd---------   2 maximgekk  staff    64 Dec 13 18:42 aaa\r\n```\r\n3. Create a table with a partition folder in the base folder:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> create table tbl (id int) partitioned by (part0 int, part1 int);\r\nspark-sql> alter table tbl add partition (part0=1,part1=2) location '/Users/maximgekk/tmp/part-location/tbl';\r\n``` \r\n4. Try to drop this partition:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> alter table tbl drop partition (part0=1,part1=2);\r\n20/12/13 18:46:07 ERROR HiveClientImpl:\r\n======================\r\nAttempt to drop the partition specs in table 'tbl' database 'default':\r\nMap(part0 -> 1, part1 -> 2)\r\nIn this attempt, the following partitions have been dropped successfully:\r\n\r\nThe remaining partitions have not been

`/Users/maximgekk/tmp/part-location/tbl`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected tests from local IDEA which does not have access to folders out of partition paths.","created_at":"2020-12-13T09:00:20Z","updated_at":"2022-05-09T00:31:45Z","closed_at":"2020-12-14T06:57:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0264e83f6df07a03a454117e966d9ec4605cc2e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30752/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30752/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30752/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e9a613303ef8f4476db464f02578493ada1cf49d","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-drop-partition-location","ref":"fix-drop-partition-location","sha":"e9a613303ef8f4476db464f02578493ada1cf49d","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFrom [minikube version v1.1.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/v1.1.0/CHANGELOG.md) kubectl is available as a command. So the kubeconfig settings can be accessed like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ minikube kubectl config view\r\napiVersion: v1\r\nclusters:\r\n- cluster:\r\n    certificate-authority: /Users/attilazsoltpiros/.minikube/ca.crt\r\n    server: https://127.0.0.1:32788\r\n  name: minikube\r\ncontexts:\r\n- context:\r\n    cluster: minikube\r\n    namespace: default\r\n    user: minikube\r\n  name: minikube\r\ncurrent-context: minikube\r\nkind: Config\r\npreferences: {}\r\nusers:\r\n- name: minikube\r\n  user:\r\n    client-certificate: /Users/attilazsoltpiros/.minikube/profiles/minikube/client.crt\r\n    client-key: /Users/attilazsoltpiros/.minikube/profiles/minikube/client.key\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere the vm-driver was docker and the server port (https://127.0.0.1:32788) is different from the hardcoded 8443.\r\n\r\nSo the main part of this PR is introducing kubernetes client configuration based on the kubeconfig (output of `minikube kubectl config view`) in case of minikube versions after v1.1.0 and the old legacy way of configuration is also kept as minikube version should be supported back to v0.34.1 .\r\n\r\nMoreover as the old style of config parsing pattern wasn't sufficient in my case as when the `minikube kubectl config view` is called kubectl downloading message might be included before the first key I changed it even for the existent keys to be a consistent pattern in this file.\r\n\r\nThe old parsing in an example:\r\n```\r\nprivate val HOST_PREFIX = \"host:\"\r\n\r\nval hostString = statusString.find(_.contains(s\"$HOST_PREFIX \"))\r\n\r\nval status1 = hostString.get.split(HOST_PREFIX)(1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new parsing: \r\n```\r\nprivate val HOST_PREFIX = \"host: \"\r\n\r\nval hostString = statusString.find(_.contains(HOST_PREFIX))\r\n\r\nhostString.get.split(HOST_PREFIX)(1)\r\n``` \r\n\r\nSo the PREFIX is extended with the extra space at the declaration (this way the two separate string operation are more safe and consistent with each other) and the replace is changed to split and getting the 2nd string from the result (which is guaranteed to contain only the text after the PREFIX when the PREFIX is a contained substring).\r\n\r\nFinally there is tiny change in `dev-run-integration-tests.sh` to introduce `--skip-building-dependencies` which switchs off building of maven dependencies of `kubernetes-integration-tests` from the Spark project.\r\nThis could be used when only the `kubernetes-integration-tests` should be rebuilded as only the tests are modified. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nKubernetes client configuration based on kubeconfig settings is more reliable and provides a solution which is minikube version independent.\r\n \r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is only test code.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\ntested manually on two minikube versions.\r\n\r\nMinikube  v0.34.1:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ minikube version\r\nminikube version: v0.34.1\r\n\r\n$ grep \"version\\|building\" resource-managers/kubernetes/integration-tests/target/integration-tests.log\r\n20/12/12

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrent Spark Web UI job page's header link of pending/skipped stages is inconsistent with their statuses. See the picture below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9404831/101998894-1e843180-3c8c-11eb-8d94-10df9edb68e7.png)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe code determining the `pendingOrSkippedTableId` has the wrong logic. As explained in the code:\r\n> If the job is completed, then any pending stages are displayed as \"skipped\" [code pointer](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ui/jobs/JobPage.scala#L266)\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the logic for `pendingOrSkippedTableId` which aligns with the stage statuses.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nVerified that header link is consistent with stage status with the fix.\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-12T23:15:16Z","updated_at":"2020-12-13T13:13:15Z","closed_at":"2020-12-13T13:01:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"884116e9dc5d0f2891a9aebfa7fd72e9447820b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

Move the `ALTER TABLE .. DROP PARTITION` parsing tests to `AlterTableDropPartitionParserSuite`\r\n2. Place v1 tests for `ALTER TABLE .. DROP PARTITION` from `DDLSuite` and v2 tests from `AlterTablePartitionV2SQLSuite` to the common trait `AlterTableDropPartitionSuiteBase`, so, the tests will run for V1, Hive V1 and V2 DS.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- The unification will allow to run common `ALTER TABLE .. DROP PARTITION` tests for both DSv1 and Hive DSv1, DSv2\r\n- We can detect missing features and differences between DSv1 and DSv2 implementations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *AlterTableDropPartitionParserSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

likely to be useful in statistical applications which involve combining probabilities, or financial applications that involve combining cumulative interest rates, but is also a versatile mathematical operation of similar status to `sum` or `stddev`. Other users [have noted](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52991640/cumulative-product-in-spark) the absence of such a function in current releases of Spark.\r\n\r\nThis function is both much more concise than an expression of the form `exp(sum(log(...)))`, and avoids awkward edge-cases associated with some values being zero or negative, as well as being less computationally costly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo - only adds new function.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBuilt-in tests have been added for the new `catalyst.expressions.aggregate.Product` class and its invocation via the (scala) `sql.functions.product` function. The latter, and the PySpark wrapper have also been manually tested in spark-shell and pyspark sessions. The SparkR wrapper is currently untested, and may need separate validation (I'm not an \"R\" user myself).\r\n\r\nAn illustration of the new functionality, within PySpark is as follows:\r\n```\r\nimport pyspark.sql.functions as pf, pyspark.sql.window as pw\r\n\r\ndf = sqlContext.range(1, 17).toDF(\"x\")\r\nwin = pw.Window.partitionBy(pf.lit(1)).orderBy(pf.col(\"x\"))\r\n\r\ndf.withColumn(\"factorial\", pf.product(\"x\").over(win)).show(20, False)\r\n+---+---------------+\r\n|x  |factorial
