has no user-visible effect unless they have to declare a variable of type `Trigger`, etc, since we use factory methods where extra type parameters are just a warning. For this PR, I have deliberately _not_ cleared out such parameters from examples or integration tests, to be sure that nothing is broken. I will follow up with that.\n\nThis is in service of the runner API in that triggers move towards a cross-language cross-runner syntax and clearing out this type parameter makes it easier to proceed with further refactors.\n","created_at":"2016-04-11T22:16:05Z","updated_at":"2016-04-19T17:23:01Z","closed_at":"2016-04-12T16:32:28Z","merged_at":"2016-04-12T16:32:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"de9f10c4b23912b590dd66e42a4fc4e0513fe6fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/168/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/168/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/168/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/de9f10c4b23912b590dd66e42a4fc4e0513fe6fd","head":{"label":"kennknowles:Trigger-window","ref":"Trigger-window","sha":"de9f10c4b23912b590dd66e42a4fc4e0513fe6fd","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

is a sample for [[BEAM-134] Investigate use of AutoValue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-134)\n\nIn the case of `IsmFormat`, there are four inner-classes used as immutable value types which can be simplified with AutoValue. Each of them demonstrate some interesting functionality:\n- `KeyPrefix` is the simplest of the bunch, and it's implementation basically disappears after conversion.\n- `IsmRecord` can act as two different types (value or metadata), and has validation logic in its getters they verify correct usage. In this case, we can keep the existing getter functionality and let AutoValue hook into separate package-private abstract properties. `IsmShard` is similar in this respect.\n- `Footer` provides has custom logic in its `.toString()` to include a version string. For other value classes, AutoValue will generate a `toString()` implementation compatible with the equivalent `Objects.toStringHelper` version. In this case, we can keep the existing implementation and AutoValue won't override it.\n\nAs noted in the JIRA issue, I've identified 39 distinct classes which could be similarly converted. The benefits to converting are:\n- Less boilerplate code to maintain.\n- Eliminate a common source of bugs.\n- Lower the barrier to writing immutable value types, which carry their own benefits.\n\nI recommend we take this work.\n","created_at":"2016-03-31T22:27:57Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T16:51:52Z","closed_at":"2016-04-20T23:06:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4ba224c88d471234ce6450f141711c26f43cd3a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/109/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/109/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/109/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/387ba13db24eec57020d499ffc7ae4a4b8052be0","head":{"label":"swegner:autovalue-example","ref":"autovalue-example","sha":"387ba13db24eec57020d499ffc7ae4a4b8052be0","user":{"login":"swegner","id":674021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDAyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner","html_url":"https://github.com/swegner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52832170,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjgzMjE3MA==","name":"beam","full_name":"swegner/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"swegner","id":674021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDAyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner","html_url":"https://github.com/swegner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/swegner/beam","description":"Mirror

from a few improvements, this PR introduces bounded sources in streaming. The BoundedSource wrapper (`SourceInputFormat`) is the same as for the batch part of the runner. The translator assigns ingestion time watermarks and processing time timestamps upon reading from the source. We could make this more flexible in terms of watermark generation if we had an UnboundedSource wrapper for a BoundedSource.\n\nPerhaps we could have common utility for runners to deal with serialization of PipelineOptions. At some point, they have to be shipped. I had to change the serialization code because I was experiencing a serialization bug which led to a serialization loop. Debugging this was almost impossible because the stack trace doesn't show all serialization calls due to some magic in the VM. I didn't find any cyclic references between the PipelineOptions and Flink components. I'm assuming this is a bug and the workaround using byte array serialization of the options is fair enough. See `SourceInputFormat`.\n","created_at":"2016-03-31T13:49:37Z","updated_at":"2016-04-18T16:26:37Z","closed_at":"2016-04-18T14:38:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"25b50d840d3d61e875a9d444f936f0a432bfbe1f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/104/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/104/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/104/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/f83c1496e61c03aeb08b36eb57ee006788e69444","head":{"label":"mxm:BEAM-158","ref":"BEAM-158","sha":"f83c1496e61c03aeb08b36eb57ee006788e69444","user":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52998913,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1Mjk5ODkxMw==","name":"beam","full_name":"mxm/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mxm","id":837221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzIyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mxm/beam","description":"Mirror
