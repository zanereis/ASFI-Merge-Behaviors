you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n* Removed list structure for peer selection as it was unnecessary and often wasteful (most clusters are 3 - 7 nodes, the list was always 128 elements).\r\n* Changed integer percentages to double to allow for better normalization.\r\n* Removed 80% cap on remote peers as it was due to legacy requirements.\r\n* Added unit tests for non-deterministic distribution calculations.\r\n* Added unit tests for edge cases due to rounding errors, single valid remotes, unbalanced clusters, and peer queue consecutive selection tracking.\r\n* Migrated all legacy PeerSelector unit tests to new API.\r\n* Removed unused System time manipulation as tests no longer need it.\r\n* Added class-level Javadoc to PeerSelector.\r\n* Removed S2S details request replication, as the responses were not being merged, which led to incorrect ports being returned and breaking S2S peer retrieval.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nIn RunMongoAggregation processor, when the aggregation returns no value the processor only returns the original flowfile in its relationship. In this case we have to create an auxiliary flow to handle each case. This PR creates an \"empty\" relationship, sending to it a empty flowfile if the aggragations result is empty as well.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [x] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of the Ignite processors forces one to make use of the Thick Ignite client. This may be problematic in cases where Ignite resides within a Kubernetes cluster while NiFi is outside of the Kubernetes cluster. Also, it may be the case that for certain scenarios the thin Ignite client might be a better fit than the thick Ignite client.\r\n \r\nWith this feature the possibility of choosing between the two clients will be allowed.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nFreeFormTextRecordSetWriter allows the use of record field names in NiFi Expression Language expressions, but it does not allow the use of attributes or variables from the flowfile and environment, respectively. This PR makes attributes and variables available to the writer, but does not override any existing field name/value from the record.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nMoves core MiNiFi modules to NiFi codebase, allows the specification of a MiNiFi config.yaml to replace bootstrap.conf and nifi.properties and to provide a static flow in NiFi. This is part of a larger effort (MINIFI-422) to align MiNiFi and NiFi codebases. The first commit is from Aldrin Piri who led the way on this effort.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-7403\r\nPutSQL processor support `<Support Fragmented Transactions>`,if we set this property true, I think it means The PutSQL processor will excute these sqls of one transaction Transactionally!!\r\n\r\nBut we find that when we set the `<Rollback On Failure>` false, those sqls of one transaction do not excute transactionally,some sucess and some failure. I think it's not right.\r\n\r\nI think, if we set `<Support Fragmented Transactions>` true, it should be executed Transactionally, no matter `<Rollback On Failure>` is true or false.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces #4239\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ √] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ √] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ √] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [√ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

This also involved refactoring duplicate enums and removing legacy modules which were no longer necessary. Additional comments, unit tests, and regression tests were introduced._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nIt is useful for automated NiFi builds to be able to use the latest version of Apache Hive. Some build scripts already set hive.version to the Hive version to use. When switching from Hive 1.2 to Hive 3, the hive.version property should be set to the Hive 3 version in order to not break existing automated build jobs, and future-proof it for Hive 3.x.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-06T21:02:22Z","updated_at":"2020-05-06T23:38:53Z","closed_at":"2020-05-06T23:38:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"13cc77825939deb723f7caa180b536581af2b839","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4259/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4259/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4259/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/34c18bba0561493d99cdceb15ccebdf2f7be44a4","head":{"label":"mattyb149:NIFI-7428","ref":"NIFI-7428","sha":"34c18bba0561493d99cdceb15ccebdf2f7be44a4","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28576559,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU3NjU1OQ==","name":"nifi","full_name":"mattyb149/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149/nifi","description":"Mirror

case of writing Avro file, we did experience ClassCastExceptions in some cases. It was due to the validation allowed passing Integer as Long (as Integer is considered as a narrow type of Long), but Avro writing (AvroRecordSetWriter) was not prepared to handle this discrepancy. During the investigation it has turned out that AvroTypeUtil#convertToAvroObject covers this (as during conversion it tries to fit incoming Record field with Avro expectations) expect in this particular case. This small change aims this issue following.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR removes the http.param attribute. It contained both the query parameters already captured in http.query.param _and_ the multipart form data names and values, which are captured in the part data, and could be very very large.\r\n\r\nRemoving the attribute may be a big deal, but since _any_ form data can be large, putting in as an attribute is wrong and duplicates with the other attribute. \r\n\r\nWhen you filter the part data out, all that is left is the query params, which are also already captured, so I just got rid of the attribute.\r\n\r\nI also added a WritesAttribute for http.query.param which was missing.\r\nIf it helps, http.param was NOT documented anyways.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\nAccording to the documentation of ToStringBuilder the method setDefaultStyle() should only be called once since it sets a Singleton value.\r\nFixed by passing ToStringStyle as an parameter to ToStringBuilder constructor directly.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [x] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nThe ASF has a new way of configuring integrations and such for the Apache GitHub repositories. It involves putting a .asf.yaml file at the root of the project with various settings, such as email addresses for notifications, which buttons/facets should be available on the UI, etc. I retained the original settings from the old configuration.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nfixes bug NIFI-7410 \r\n\r\nwhen ExecuteSql or QueryDataBaseTable processor trigger below code in JdbcCommon.java ,clob would be unreadable code（with Chinese character）,because it used\r\n`InputStream is = clob.getAsciiStream();` and ` rec.put(i - 1, new String(buffer));`\r\n\r\nUpdate JdbcCommon.java when javaSqlType is CLOB or NCLOB in convertToAvroStream method, use the DataTypeUtils.toString(clob/nClob,(String) null, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)) method to get the String\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we

and H2O Driverless AI Integration** via Custom NiFi Processor:\r\n\r\nIntegrates NiFi with H2O Driverless AI by using Driverless AI's MOJO Scoring Pipeline (in Java Runtime) and NiFi's Custom Processor. This processor executes the MOJO Scoring Pipeline to do batch scoring or real-time scoring for one or more predicted labels on tabular data in the incoming flow file content. If the tabular data is one row, then the MOJO does real-time scoring. If the tabular data is multiple rows, then the MOJO does batch scoring.

PR has been replaced by #4266\r\n\r\nPut.java improvement(PutSQL's transactions support)\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nPutSQL processor support `<Support Fragmented Transactions>`,if we set this property true, I think it means The PutSQL processor will excute these sqls of one transaction Transactionally!!\r\n\r\nBut we find that when we set the `<Rollback On Failure>` false, those sqls of one transaction do not excute transactionally,some sucess and some failure. I think it's wrong.\r\n\r\nI think, if we set `<Support Fragmented Transactions>` true, it should be executed Transactionally, no matter `<Rollback On Failure>` is true or false.\r\n\r\nMaybe we don't need this feature now, especially we generate table data by `select`,but when we exact data from redo log(mysql binlog、Oracle LogMiner ...), we would be likely to transacrionally excute these sqls in the target database. \r\n\r\nI see the code, only PutSQL has the `<Support Fragmented Transactions>`, it maybe improve this feature at a small cost.\r\n\r\nmodify code design:\r\n\r\nstep1: Maybe other Processors would support the `<Support Fragmented Transactions>`(such as PutDatabaseRecord), we should move the `<Support Fragmented Transactions>` from PutSQL.java to Put.java( I think it's a rational design that `Put.java` define the `<Support Fragmented Transactions>` property )\r\n```java\r\npublic static final PropertyDescriptor SUPPORT_TRANSACTIONS = new PropertyDescriptor.Builder()\r\n            .name(\"Support Fragmented Transactions\")\r\n           ...\r\n```\r\nstep2: Additionally, I think the Put.java can extract the RelationShips of the processors those use the Put.java(PutSQL PutDatabaseRecord, PutHiveQL...We can see that these processors who use the Put.java have the same Relationships, I think this is the `Put`'s common feature)\r\n\r\n```java\r\n   static final Relationship REL_SUCCESS = new Relationship.Builder()\r\n            .name(\"success\")\r\n            .description(\"A FlowFile is routed to this relationship after the database is successfully updated\")\r\n            .build();\r\n    static final Relationship REL_RETRY = new Relationship.Builder()\r\n            .name(\"retry\")\r\n            .description(\"A FlowFile is routed to this relationship if the database cannot be updated but attempting the operation again may succeed\")\r\n            .build();\r\n    static final Relationship REL_FAILURE = new Relationship.Builder()\r\n            .name(\"failure\")\r\n            .description(\"A FlowFile is routed to this relationship if the database cannot be updated and retrying the operation will also fail, \"\r\n                    + \"such as an invalid query or an integrity constraint violation\")\r\n            .build();\r\n```\r\nstep3: in Put.java `onTrigger` method, after the `putFlowFiles` and before the `onCompleted.apply`, we try to get the value of `<Rollback On Failure>`, if true , check the `transferredFlowFiles` , if there are flowfiles which don't route to `Success`, we should reroute these `transferredFlowFiles`(retry > failure), and do `onFailed` function(if it's not null)\r\n\r\n```java\r\n          try {\r\n                    putFlowFiles(context, session, functionContext, connection, flowFiles, result);\r\n                } catch (DiscontinuedException e) {\r\n\r\n               }\r\n               ...\r\n               if (context.getProperties().containsKey(SUPPORT_TRANSACTIONS) && context.getProperty(SUPPORT_TRANSACTIONS).asBoolean()) {\r\n                    //TODO   do sth\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                if (onCompleted != null) {\r\n                    onCompleted.apply(context, session, functionContext, connection);\r\n                }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ √] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nAdds an OnAdded annotation/method to ExecuteScript and InvokeScriptedProcessor, in order to ensure that the script engines are created by a thread using the processor's instance classloader. There was no real way to unit test this, but I verified on a live NiFi instance.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nInstead of all PrometheusReportingTasks and the flow metrics REST endpoint sharing the same metrics collection registries and metric objects, this PR refactors it so each component can create its own set of registries and metrics, so they don't interfere with each other.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_This PR allows the `EncryptContent` processor to use the new Argon2 KDF, fixes a legacy issue in the Bcrypt KDF (with backward compatibility), introduces encryption metadata attributes to flowfiles encrypted/decrypted by `EncryptContent` (also completing NIFI-3889), and improves the custom validation in the processor._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nUpdates ComponentLog interface to accept Object varargs simplifying logger statements in the code. It is no longer required to create a new Object array; just pass the substitution values directly.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

original issue was that when reading in Avro record containing decimal (logical) type, the incoming floating point data might loose precision due to the record reader parses this data type into a double value. In order to avoid this I added BigDecimal support next to the BigInteger support in a similar fashion. With this, decimal (logical) types from Avro input are handled as BigDecimal internally. Adding it as supported type in record correctly came with touching parts not strictly bounded to my particular issue but needed to be done to not leave loose ends.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR fundamentally removes the hard-coded number of flowfiles in the listing returned by StandardConnectionDAO.java, adding a new parameter called 'maxResults' to the parent interface.  This value can then be consulted and used when calling the backend for the queue listing.  The current hard-coded value of '100' can be limiting in certain use cases, for example, when the queue has a backlog of > 100 flowfiles and the dataflow manager needs to interrogate the 101+ flowfile.\r\n\r\nThe maxResults parameter is exposed as part of the REST API, so that calling programs (like the UI) can control the number of displayed flowfiles.  By default, the listing size will remain at 100, but a UI option is added to \"view all\" flowfiles in the queue.  Additionally, the parameter can be controlled by the REST API for custom clients.\r\n\r\nThis PR is broken into two commits; one for the backend changes, one for the UI changes.  These can be considered separately or can be easily squashed together as desired.\r\n\r\nThis features closes
