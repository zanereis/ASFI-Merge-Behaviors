the `BrokerServer` starts its shutting down process, it transitions to `SHUTTING_DOWN` and sets `isShuttingDown` to `true`. With this state change, the follower state changes are short-cutted. This means that a broker which was serving as leader would remain acting as a leader until controlled shutdown completes. Instead, we want the leader and ISR state to be updated so that requests will return NOT_LEADER and the client can find the new leader.\r\n\r\nWe missed this case while implementing https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12187.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the issue and updates an existing test to ensure that `isShuttingDown` has not effect.

interfaces (and their future impls) are added under the processor/internals/tasks package, to distinguish with the existing old classes:\r\n\r\n1. TaskExecutor is the interface for a processor thread. It takes at most one task to process at a given time from the task manager. When being asked from the task manager to un-assign the current processing task, it will stop processing and give the task back to task manager.\r\n2. TaskManager schedules all the active tasks to assign to TaskExecutors. Specifically: 1) when a task executor ask it for an unassigned task to process (assignNextTask), it will return the available task based on its scheduling algorithm. 2) when the task manager decides to commit (all) tasks, or when a rebalance event requires it to modify the maintained active tasks (via onAssignment), it will lock all the tasks that are going to be closed / committed, asking the

from a follower is only allowed from version 11 of the fetch request. Our intent was to allow it assuming that those would also implement KIP-320 (leader epoch). It turns out that some clients use version 11 without KIP-320 and the broker allows this. The issue is that we don't know whether the client fetches from the follower based on the order of the leader or by mistake e.g. based on stale metadata. The latter means that a client could end up on the follower with an offset that the follower does not have yet. Instead of returning OffsetOutOfRangeException, we return an empty batch to the client with the expectation that the client will retry and eventually refresh its metadata. Note that we only do this if the client does not provide a leader epoch and use version 11. If the client uses version 11 and provided a leader epoch, it knows that it has to consult the leader on an OffsetOutOfRangeException error.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

the input partitions of tasks also updates the mapping from source nodes to input topics in the processor topology within the task. The mapping is updated with the topics from the topology metadata. The topology metadata does not prefix intermediate internal topics with the application ID. Thus, if a standby task has input partitions from an intermediate internal topic the update of the mapping in the processor topology leads to an invalid topology exception during recycling of a standby task to an active task when the input queues are created. This is because the input topics in the processor topology and the input partitions of the task do not match because the former miss the application ID prefix.\r\n\r\nThe added verification to only update input partitions of standby tasks if they really changed avoids the invalid topology exception if the standby task only has input partitions from intermediate internal topics since they should never change. If the standby task has input partitions from intermediate internal topics and external topics subscribed to via a regex pattern, the invalid topology exception might still be triggered.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

PR migrates EasyMock to Mockito for ConnectorsResourceTest, notable changes:\r\n\r\n* The expectCallback functions (such as `expectAndCallbackResult`) have been changed to return a `Stubbing` due to the fact that unlike EasyMock (which applies the mocking to the last statement), Mockito uses a builder pattern on stubbing.\r\n* When using `any(<class>)` from Mockito it doesn't work with `static` classes (or in other words it will fail to pick up the mock if a `class` class is supplied). Due to this `EasyMock.anyObject(InternalRequestSignature.class)` has been changed to `any()` instead of `any(InternalRequestSignature.class)`\r\n* `RestClient` had to be changed to use `mockStatic`

how we generate KRaft metadata images from MetadataImage.java. This is a step in the direction of properly supporting lossy downgrade, although more steps will be needed.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new ImageWriter interface which replaces the generic Consumer interface which accepted lists of records. It is better to do batching in the ImageWriter than to try to deal with that complexity in the MetadataImage#write functions, especially since batching is not semantically meaningful in KRaft snapshots. The new ImageWriter interface also supports freeze and close, which more closely matches the semantics of the underlying Raft classes.\r\n\r\nThe PR also adds an ImageWriterOptions class which we can use to pass parameters to control how the new image is written. Right now, the parameters that we are interested in are the target metadata version (which may be more or less than the original image's version) and a handler function which is invoked whenever metadata is lost due to the target version.\r\n\r\nConvert over the MetadataImage#write function (and associated functions) to use the new ImageWriter and ImageWriterOptions. In particular, we now have a way to handle metadata losses by invoking ImageWriterOptions#handleLoss.\r\n\r\nGet rid of the use of SOME_RECORD_TYPE.highestSupportedVersion() in several places. In general, we do not want to \"silently\" change the version of a record that we output, just because a new version was added.  We should be explicit about what record version numbers we are outputting.\r\n\r\nMove the highest offset, highest epoch, and highest timestamp of an image into ImageProvenance.java.\r\nRemove them from MetadataDelta since many ways of constructing a delta don't require incrementally\r\ntracking these (such as loading a snapshot)\r\n\r\nImplement ProducerIdsDelta#toString, to make debug logs look better.\r\n\r\nMove MockRandom.java from metadata/src/test into server-common/src/test since it is generally useful.","created_at":"2022-10-04T21:31:33Z","updated_at":"2022-10-13T16:56:19Z","closed_at":"2022-10-13T16:56:19Z","merged_at":"2022-10-13T16:56:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"dac81161dbf743b9e0c31ab5ffa7bb8c757feb3d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12715/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12715/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12715/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/be6872d41842ae47eab42cd3fd0c7a8e9938412a","head":{"label":"cmccabe:imagewriter","ref":"imagewriter","sha":"be6872d41842ae47eab42cd3fd0c7a8e9938412a","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12695, we discovered a gap in our testing of `StandardAuthorizer`. We addressed the specific case that was failing, but I think we need to establish a better methodology for testing which incorporates randomized inputs. This patch is a start in that direction. We implement a few basic property tests using jqwik which focus on prefix searching. It catches the case from https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12695 prior to the fix. In the future, we can extend this to cover additional operation types, principal matching, etc.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

are clients out there that have implemented KIP-392 (Fetch From Follower) and thus use FetchRequest >= 11. However, they have not implemented KIP-320 which add the leader epoch to the FetchRequest in version 9. Without KIP-320, it is not safe to fetch from the follower. If a client does it by mistake – e.g. based on stale metadata – that could lead to offset out of range.\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to disable fetching from a follower when the cluster does not have a replica selector. If it does not, consumers are not expected to fetch from followers.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

during normal operation in MirrorSourceTask causes the task to fail instead of shutting down gracefully.\r\n\r\nIn MirrorSourceTask we are loading offsets for the topic partitions. At this point, while we are fetching the partitions, it is possible for the offset reader to be stopped by a parallel thread. Stopping the reader causes a CancellationException to be thrown, due to KAFKA-9051.\r\n\r\nCurrently this exception is not caught in MirrorSourceTask and so the exception propagates up and causes the task to go into FAILED state. We only need it to go to STOPPED state so that it would be restarted later.\r\n\r\nThis can be achieved by catching the exception and stopping the task directly.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

an [automatically-registered JUnit 5 extension](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/snapshot/user-guide/#extensions-registration-automatic) that installs a [SecurityManager](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/SecurityManager.html) which intercepts attempts to terminate the JVM that appear to have come from test cases, and then reports those attempts by causing tests to fail. If the test that attempted to terminate the JVM is running at the time of the attempt, that test will fail. If not, a random test will fail at a later point (in order to fail the CI build and surface the issue), with a message reporting that a prior test appears to have leaked a thread which has attempted to terminate the JVM after that test completed.~\r\n\r\n~The [InheritableThreadLocal](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/InheritableThreadLocal.html) class is used to track which tests attempt to terminate the JVM, including cases where the attempt occurs in a separate thread, and even when the attempt has occurred after the test has already completed.~\r\n\r\n~Although the `SecurityManager` API was deprecated and slated for removal in [JEP-411](https://openjdk.org/jeps/411), there is no existing alternative for intercepting attempts to terminate the JVM (see https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8199704). Once an alternative becomes available, we can use it instead of the `SecurityManager` API.~\r\n\r\n~This is heavily inspired by the [system-rules](https://github.com/stefanbirkner/system-rules) library, with some modifications to support parallel testing.~\r\n\r\n~It's worth noting that there is a potentially much-simpler fix where we modify the `Exit` wrapper classes to use `InheritableThreadLocal` instances to track custom procedures. However, this does not automatically prevent the JVM from being accidentally terminated during testing (tests still have to remember to use the wrapper class), and it does not provide a way to fail the build when unexpected attempts to terminate the JVM take place, potentially swallowing dangerous failures during testing and CI.~\r\n\r\nUses an [automatically-registered JUnit 5 extension](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/snapshot/user-guide/#extensions-registration-automatic) that installs a custom default exit procedure which intercepts attempts to terminate the JVM that appear to have come from test cases, and then reports those attempts by causing tests to fail. If the test that attempted to terminate the JVM is running at the time of the attempt, that test will fail. If not, a random test will fail at a later point (in order to fail the CI build and surface the issue), with a message reporting that a prior test appears to have leaked a thread which has attempted to terminate the JVM after that test completed.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

StandardAuthorizer to use copy-on-write data structures.  The issue with the concurrent skiplist was that because it was modified while in use by StandardAuthorizer#authorize, we could sometimes expose an inconsistent state. For example, if we added a \"deny principal foo\", followed by \"allow all\", a request for principal foo might happen to see the second one, without seeing the first one, even though the first one was added first.\r\n\r\nIn order to efficiently implement prefix ACLs, store them in a prefix tree. This ensures that we can check all prefix ACLs for a path in logarithmic time. Also implement Authorizer#authorizeByResourceType. The default implementation of this function is quite slow, so it is good to have an implementation in StandardAuthorizer.\r\n\r\nFinally, this PR renames AclAuthorizerBenchmark to AuthorizerBenchmark and extends it to report information about StandardAuthorizer as well as AclAuthorizer.","created_at":"2022-09-19T20:48:07Z","updated_at":"2023-08-09T05:30:55Z","closed_at":"2023-08-09T05:30:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6bfb75493a75eea3879a638c9df19a1570c69dde","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12662/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12662/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12662/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/2be8ce8e921482edcc1f5f460dc5d95a52113b1d","head":{"label":"cmccabe:KAFKA-14214-III","ref":"KAFKA-14214-III","sha":"2be8ce8e921482edcc1f5f460dc5d95a52113b1d","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

have recently been seeing a lot of build failures:\r\n```\r\n[2022-09-18T10:01:25.947Z] * What went wrong:\r\n[2022-09-18T10:01:25.947Z] Execution failed for task ':core:unitTest'.\r\n[2022-09-18T10:01:25.947Z] > Process 'Gradle Test Executor 116' finished with non-zero exit value 1\r\n```\r\nIt is difficult to track this back from the build output because we don't know which test was executing on 'Gradle Test Executor 116.' There is a test logging property `displayGranularity`, which lets us see the executor for each test run: https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.logging.TestLogging.html#org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.logging.TestLogging:displayGranularity. \r\n\r\nWhen `displayGranularity` is set to 2 (the default), we get the following:\r\n```\r\nAdminZkClientTest > testGetBrokerMetadatas() PASSED\r\n```\r\nWhen set to 0, it looks like this instead:\r\n```\r\nGradle Test Run :core:test > Gradle Test Executor 76 > AdminZkClientTest > testGetBrokerMetadatas() PASSED\r\n```\r\nHopefully having this extra information makes it easier to debug failures.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

segment deletion based on size and time by setting the KRaft metadata log's `RetentionMsProp` and `RetentionBytesProp` to `-1`. This will cause `UnifiedLog.deleteRetentionMsBreachedSegments` and `UnifiedLog.deleteRetentionSizeBreachedSegments` to short circuit instead of deleting segments.\r\n\r\nWithout this changes the included test would fail. This happens because `deleteRetentionMsBreachedSegments` is able to delete past the `logStartOffset`. Deleting past the `logStartOffset` would violate the invariant that if the `logStartOffset` is greater than 0 then there is a snapshot with an end offset greater than or equal to the log start offset.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

Currently HttpAccessTokenRetriever client side class does not retrieve error response from the token e/p. As a result, seemingly trivial config issues could take a lot of time to diagnose and fix. For example, client could be sending invalid client secret, id or scope.\r\n* This PR aims to remedy the situation by retrieving the error response, if present and logging as well as appending to any exceptions thrown.\r\n* New unit tests have also been added.\r\n\r\n### Sample Output\r\nThe o/p is generated using `bin/kafka-console-producer`\r\n\r\n**Invalid
