this is my non-native English, but I often feel a bit strange\r\nwhen reading the issues raised by our users whe they start the\r\ndescription with:\r\n\r\n* \"I expected this and that\"\r\n\r\nFor me - this comes from the \"What you expected to happen\" heading\r\nwe have and I have a feeling this might lead to bad wording of the\r\nissues which can lead to unnecessary tensions. \"Expectation\" is\r\na bit too strong of a word for the Open-Source project because there\r\nmight be many reasons why the \"expectation\" is not fulfilled and\r\nthe user might not be aware, so they might \"Expect\" something in\r\na sense of \"demanding\" it, when there are good reasons things are\r\nhow they are.\r\n\r\nIn most cases people do not read the description or hint we\r\nprovided - they stop short by reading the header and base their\r\nanswer on the header.\r\n\r\nI personally perceive that when you start \"I expected this and this\",\r\nit feels like \"This is obvious it should be like this\".\r\n\r\nI think changing the heading to \"What you think should happen\"\r\nmight be much better and has much less of the \"demand\" in it.\r\nEventually it might lead to people understanding better that what\r\nthey raise here is more of a \"wish\" rather than \"expectation\" and\r\nthat this presents their personal thinking rather than \"general\r\nexpectation\".\r\n\r\nMaking sure in the heading wording that the raised issue is a bit\r\n\"softer\" might also set the tone for the follow-up conversation.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/22160\r\n\r\nIn some exceedingly rare cases, it's possible to have running tasks without a `queued_dttm`. This can cause a scheduler crashloop during task adoption as the executor tries to calculate the adoption timeout. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/9e6769206e124b65d31028a3b7b9047d51fd0be5/airflow/executors/celery_executor.py#L546\r\n\r\nBut this can be skipped, as if the task is running then the `adopted_task_timeouts` value is cleared almost immediately after it is set.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/9e6769206e124b65d31028a3b7b9047d51fd0be5/airflow/executors/celery_executor.py#L549\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/9e6769206e124b65d31028a3b7b9047d51fd0be5/airflow/executors/celery_executor.py#L474-L476\r\n\r\nSo by not setting the `adoption_task_timeout` for a running task, we can avoid ever accessing the `queued_dttm` and thus avoid the scheduler crash.

a details drawer to the right side of the grid view to quickly see details and actions for the DAG / Dag Run / Task Instance. This replaces the modal when clicking on a dag run or task instance. (Modals still exist for graph and gantt views)\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n- Simplify tooltips to only show basic at-a-glance info, and rely on the drawer for more advanced details\r\n- Show details in context of what run or task you are looking at\r\n- Dag Run and Task Instance actions in context of what Task/Run you are changing\r\n- Run and Task actions is a seamless experience without multiple page redirects. And one can immediately see changes take place.\r\n\r\nNext Up:\r\n- The side drawer for a mapped task  will include a table of all of its mapped instances with their respective actions\r\n- A better DAG details side drawer. In this PR, it is a table of some basic details, but I would like for it to be an overview of your DAG and the runs/tasks that are currently being displayed in the grid view\r\n\r\nCloses #19938\r\nCloses #21428\r\nRelated #20382\r\nCloses #19674\r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\nPython isn't my strong suit so any help with the changes I had to make to the webserver (`views.py` and `utils.py`) would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nDag Details:\r\n<img width=\"991\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-03-17 at 12 40 31 PM\"

adds an additional (optional) map_index argument to XCom's get/set/clear interface so mapped task instances can push to the correct entries, and have them pulled correctly by a downstream.\r\n\r\nTo make the XCom interface easier to use for common scenarios, a convenience method get_value is added to take a TaskInstanceKey that automatically performs argument unpacking and call get_one

#21169\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs outlined in [this issue](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/21169), running multiple KubernetesPodOperators with  `random_name_suffix=False` and `is_delete_pod_operator=True` leads to\r\n1. First task creating a pod (with name `'my_pod'` for example)\r\n2. Second task attempting to create a pod with the same name and failing because a pod with name `'my_pod'` already exists\r\n3. Second tasks deletes pod with name `'my_pod'`, which is the pod from the first task.\r\n\r\nIdeally the second tasks shouldn't delete the pod from the first task, so I added a check to make sure a task's pod exists with the `find_pod` method before calling the `cleanup` function (which handles the deletion of the pod).\r\n\r\n### Validation\r\nTo reproduce the issue and validate this change I ran two dag runs of the following DAG at the same time.\r\n```python\r\nfrom datetime import timedelta\r\nfrom airflow import models\r\nfrom airflow import utils\r\nfrom airflow.providers.cncf.kubernetes.operators.kubernetes_pod import KubernetesPodOperator\r\n\r\ndag = models.DAG(\r\n    'kubernetes_change_validation',\r\n    start_date=utils.dates.days_ago(2),\r\n    max_active_runs=3,\r\n    dagrun_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),\r\n    schedule_interval='@daily'\r\n)\r\n\r\ntest_kubernetes_pod= KubernetesPodOperator(\r\n    namespace='my_namespace',\r\n    image=\"busybox\",\r\n    cmds=['sh', '-c', 'sleep 600'],\r\n    name=\"test_kubernetes_pod\",\r\n    in_cluster=True,\r\n    task_id=\"test_kubernetes_pod\",\r\n    get_logs=True,\r\n    random_name_suffix=False,\r\n    dag=dag,\r\n    is_delete_operator_pod=True\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-08T16:12:26Z","updated_at":"2022-06-21T15:51:21Z","closed_at":"2022-06-21T15:51:21Z","merged_at":"2022-06-21T15:51:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"78ac48872bd02d1c08c6e55525f0bb4d6e983d32","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2458345138,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDU4MzQ1MTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/okay%20to%20merge","name":"okay

is (soon to be GA) feature that allows to start\r\ndevelopment environment on a virtual machine directly from the\r\nGitHub UI or from VSCode connected with GitHub account.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds

replace Breeze/CI but for most users who want\r\nto just run a few tests, make sure that all dependencies\r\nand plugins are installed so that the users can get the\r\nVSCode autocomplete and execution of the tests possible.\r\n\r\nThis is a great way to begin your journey with Airflow - while\r\nthe Codespace machines are not very powerful and the integration\r\ntests might require more resources, the \"no-setup\"\r\nenvironment and no need to have powerful machine is great\r\nfor contributors who cannot afford powerful development\r\nworkstations.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for
