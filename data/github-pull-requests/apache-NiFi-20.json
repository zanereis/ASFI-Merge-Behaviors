If NiFi is shut down, and then restarted, the parameter context is loaded by the controller and FlowManager, but the description is not loaded. The flow is then saved to disk, loosing the parameter context description in the process.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves that by modifying the FlowManager interface and adding a `description` parameter to the createParameterContext method. Then in AbstractFlowManager, a `.setDescription()` step is added, to add the passed description value to the created parameter context.\r\nAlso added a test to verify that the parameter context that is imported to the flow manager contains a description if the flow.xml.gz flow file had a description for it.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the edits are to make existing tests and function calls compatible with the updated FlowManager change.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] [Apache NiFi

their own mime types as well using the out of the box tika mime type definitions at the same time.\r\n\r\nUser defined mime types take precedence over the default definitions.\r\n\r\nThis also provides a workaround for [NIFI-11084](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11084) as noted in comment there.\r\n\r\nTo test,\r\nFor IdentifyMimeType Config File property, use  [.customConfig.xml](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/rel/nifi-1.23.2/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors/src/test/resources/TestIdentifyMimeType/.customConfig.xml) \r\n\r\nTest 1:\r\nFor Config Strategy use \"add\"\r\nPass through [jpg](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/rel/nifi-1.23.2/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors/src/test/resources/TestIdentifyMimeType/blueBtnBg.jpg) and [zip](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/rel/nifi-1.23.2/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors/src/test/resources/TestIdentifyMimeType/1.zip) files.\r\nVerify mime.type is my/jpeg and application/zip, respectively\r\n\r\nTest 2 (this verifies previously existing processor behaviour still works as before):\r\nfor Config Strategy use \"replace\"\r\npass through previous two files\r\nVerify mime.type is my/jpeg and application/octet-stream, respectively.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n###

As a proposal, I created a separate test instance for Python-related IT tests. This way, the traditional IT tests can run without python.\r\n\r\nAs a follow-up, I'd like to move Python tests to a separate module, where we could download python just like what we do in the web modules with npm and node.

to fail. There were a couple of related issues. Firstly, for Stateless Groups we were not waiting for the group to fully stop before attempting to update the flow but were waiting only for child/descendant groups to stop. This was due to misleading naming in the ProcessGroupUpdateStrategy enum. Renamed enum values to more clearly convey what they mean. Additionally, renamed the enum to more clearly convey what how it is used, since it is used not only for updating groups but also for retrieving groups. Additionally, when waiting for stateless groups to stop, we inadvertently checked the Set of affectedComponents' IDs against Process Group IDs so addressed the logic there and also ensured that we were consistent in setting the AffectedComponentEntity's ProcessGroup (i.e., its ProcessGroupNameDTO) as we were inconsistently setting it across the codebase.\r\n\r\n<!-- Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more -->\r\n<!-- contributor license agreements.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12094](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12094) Removes the deprecated `EncryptContent` and `CryptographicHashAttribute` Processors from the main branch.\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11184](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11184) deprecated `CryptographicHashAttribute` in NiFi 1.21.0 and \r\n[NIFI-12093](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12093) deprecated `EncryptContent` for NiFi 1.24.0.\r\n\r\nAttribute hashing can be implemented using `UpdateAttribute` with the [hash](https://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/html/expression-language-guide.html#hash) Expression Language function.\r\n\r\nThe `EncryptContentPGP` and `EncryptContentAge` Processors provide better alternatives for encrypting new files according to standard formatting. The `DecryptContent` and `DecryptContentCompatibility` Processors support deciphering historical files encrypted using `EncryptContent` custom encoding.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include removing the `CipherProvider` interface and implementations from `nifi-security-utils`.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

The controller service can be moved to the parent process group or a child process group. However, it can only be moved one level at a time. If the move is to a child process group, any processor that references the controller service that is outside the scope of the new process group will have the reference removed. Likewise, if the move is to a parent node, any controller service that is referenced by the controller service being moved and that is outside of the new scope will have that referenced removed.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull
