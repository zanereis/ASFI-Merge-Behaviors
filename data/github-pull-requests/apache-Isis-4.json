href=\"https://jsoup.org/news/release-1.18.1\">https://jsoup.org/news/release-1.18.1</a></p>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stream Parser</strong>: A <code>StreamParser</code> provides a progressive parse of its input. As each <code>Element</code> is completed, it is\nemitted via a <code>Stream</code> or <code>Iterator</code> interface. Elements returned will be complete with all their children, and an\n(empty) next sibling, if applicable. Elements (or their children) may be removed from the DOM during the parse,\nfor e.g. to conserve memory, providing a mechanism to parse an input document that would otherwise be too large to fit\ninto memory, yet still providing a DOM interface to the document and its elements. Additionally, the parser provides\na <code>selectFirst(String query)</code> / <code>selectNext(String query)</code>, which will run the parser until a hit is found, at which\npoint the parse is suspended. It can be resumed via another <code>select()</code> call, or via the <code>stream()</code> or <code>iterator()</code>\nmethods. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2096\">2096</a></li>\n<li><strong>Download Progress</strong>: added a Response Progress event interface, which reports progress and URLs are downloaded (and\nparsed). Supported on both a session and a single connection\nlevel. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2164\">2164</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/656\">656</a></li>\n<li>Added <code>Path</code> accepting parse methods: <code>Jsoup.parse(Path)</code>, <code>Jsoup.parse(path, charsetName, baseUri, parser)</code>,\netc. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2055\">2055</a></li>\n<li>Updated the <code>button</code> tag configuration to include a space between multiple button elements in the <code>Element.text()</code>\nmethod. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2105\">2105</a></li>\n<li>Added support for the <code>ns|*</code> all elements in namespace Selector. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1811\">1811</a></li>\n<li>When normalising attribute names during serialization, invalid characters are now replaced with <code>_</code>, vs being\nstripped. This should make the process clearer, and generally prevent an invalid attribute name being coerced\nunexpectedly. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2143\">2143</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed previously deprecated internal classes and methods. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2094\">2094</a></li>\n<li>Build change: the built jar's OSGi manifest no longer imports itself. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2158\">2158</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When tracking source positions, if the first node was a TextNode, its position was incorrectly set\nto <code>-1.</code> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2106\">2106</a></li>\n<li>When connecting (or redirecting) to URLs with characters such as <code>{</code>, <code>}</code> in the path, a Malformed URL exception would\nbe thrown (if in development), or the URL might otherwise not be escaped correctly (if in\nproduction). The URL encoding process has been improved to handle these characters\ncorrectly. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2142\">2142</a></li>\n<li>When using <code>W3CDom</code> with a custom output Document, a Null Pointer Exception would be\nthrown. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2114\">2114</a></li>\n<li>The <code>:has()</code> selector did not match correctly when using sibling combinators (like\ne.g.: <code>h1:has(+h2)</code>). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2137\">2137</a></li>\n<li>The <code>:empty</code> selector incorrectly matched elements that started with a blank text node and were followed by\nnon-empty nodes, due to an incorrect short-circuit. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2130\">2130</a></li>\n<li><code>Element.cssSelector()</code> would fail with &quot;Did not find balanced marker&quot; when building a selector for elements that had\na <code>(</code> or <code>[</code> in their class names. And selectors with those characters escaped would not match as\nexpected. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2146\">2146</a></li>\n<li>Updated <code>Entities.escape(string)</code> to make the escaped text suitable for both text nodes and attributes (previously was\nonly for text nodes). This does not impact the output of <code>Element.html()</code> which correctly applies a minimal escape\ndepending on if the use will be for text data or in a quoted</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Supported on both a session and a single connection\nlevel. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2164\">2164</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/656\">656</a></li>\n<li>Added <code>Path</code> accepting parse methods: <code>Jsoup.parse(Path)</code>, <code>Jsoup.parse(path, charsetName, baseUri, parser)</code>,\netc. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2055\">2055</a></li>\n<li>Updated the <code>button</code> tag configuration to include a space between multiple button elements in the <code>Element.text()</code>\nmethod. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2105\">2105</a></li>\n<li>Added support for the <code>ns|*</code> all elements in namespace Selector. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1811\">1811</a></li>\n<li>When normalising attribute names during serialization, invalid characters are now replaced with <code>_</code>, vs being\nstripped. This should make the process clearer, and generally prevent an invalid attribute name being coerced\nunexpectedly. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2143\">2143</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed previously deprecated internal classes and methods. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2094\">2094</a></li>\n<li>Build change: the built jar's OSGi manifest no longer imports itself. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2158\">2158</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When tracking source positions, if the first node was a TextNode, its position was incorrectly set\nto <code>-1.</code> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2106\">2106</a></li>\n<li>When connecting (or redirecting) to URLs with characters such as <code>{</code>, <code>}</code> in the path, a Malformed URL exception would\nbe thrown (if in development), or the URL might otherwise not be escaped correctly (if in\nproduction). The URL encoding process has been improved to handle these characters\ncorrectly. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2142\">2142</a></li>\n<li>When using <code>W3CDom</code> with a custom output Document, a Null Pointer Exception would be\nthrown. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2114\">2114</a></li>\n<li>The <code>:has()</code> selector did not match correctly when using sibling combinators (like\ne.g.: <code>h1:has(+h2)</code>). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2137\">2137</a></li>\n<li>The <code>:empty</code> selector incorrectly matched elements that started with a blank text node and were followed by\nnon-empty nodes, due to an incorrect short-circuit. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2130\">2130</a></li>\n<li><code>Element.cssSelector()</code> would fail with &quot;Did not find balanced marker&quot; when building a selector for elements that had\na <code>(</code> or <code>[</code> in their class names. And selectors with those characters escaped would not match as\nexpected. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2146\">2146</a></li>\n<li>Updated <code>Entities.escape(string)</code> to make the escaped text suitable for both text nodes and attributes (previously was\nonly for text nodes). This does not impact the output of <code>Element.html()</code> which correctly applies a minimal escape\ndepending on if the use will be for text data or in a quoted\nattribute. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1278\">1278</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

[org.jsoup:jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup) from 1.17.2 to 1.18.1.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/releases\">org.jsoup:jsoup's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>jsoup-1.18.1</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://jsoup.org/news/release-1.18.1\">https://jsoup.org/news/release-1.18.1</a></p>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stream Parser</strong>: A <code>StreamParser</code> provides a progressive parse of its input. As each <code>Element</code> is completed, it is\nemitted via a <code>Stream</code> or <code>Iterator</code> interface. Elements returned will be complete with all their children, and an\n(empty) next sibling, if applicable. Elements (or their children) may be removed from the DOM during the parse,\nfor e.g. to conserve memory, providing a mechanism to parse an input document that would otherwise be too large to fit\ninto memory, yet still providing a DOM interface to the document and its elements. Additionally, the parser provides\na <code>selectFirst(String query)</code> / <code>selectNext(String query)</code>, which will run the parser until a hit is found, at which\npoint the parse is suspended. It can be resumed via another <code>select()</code> call, or via the <code>stream()</code> or <code>iterator()</code>\nmethods. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2096\">2096</a></li>\n<li><strong>Download Progress</strong>: added a Response Progress event interface, which reports progress and URLs are downloaded (and\nparsed). Supported on both a session and a single connection\nlevel. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2164\">2164</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/656\">656</a></li>\n<li>Added <code>Path</code> accepting parse methods: <code>Jsoup.parse(Path)</code>, <code>Jsoup.parse(path, charsetName, baseUri, parser)</code>,\netc. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2055\">2055</a></li>\n<li>Updated the <code>button</code> tag configuration to include a space between multiple button elements in the <code>Element.text()</code>\nmethod. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2105\">2105</a></li>\n<li>Added support for the <code>ns|*</code> all elements in namespace Selector. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1811\">1811</a></li>\n<li>When normalising attribute names during serialization, invalid characters are now replaced with <code>_</code>, vs being\nstripped.

As each <code>Element</code> is completed, it is\nemitted via a <code>Stream</code> or <code>Iterator</code> interface. Elements returned will be complete with all their children, and an\n(empty) next sibling, if applicable. Elements (or their children) may be removed from the DOM during the parse,\nfor e.g. to conserve memory, providing a mechanism to parse an input document that would otherwise be too large to fit\ninto memory, yet still providing a DOM interface to the document and its elements. Additionally, the parser provides\na <code>selectFirst(String query)</code> / <code>selectNext(String query)</code>, which will run the parser until a hit is found, at which\npoint the parse is suspended. It can be resumed via another <code>select()</code> call, or via the <code>stream()</code> or <code>iterator()</code>\nmethods. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2096\">2096</a></li>\n<li><strong>Download Progress</strong>: added a Response Progress event interface, which reports progress and URLs are downloaded (and\nparsed). Supported on both a session and a single connection\nlevel. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2164\">2164</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/656\">656</a></li>\n<li>Added <code>Path</code> accepting parse methods: <code>Jsoup.parse(Path)</code>, <code>Jsoup.parse(path, charsetName, baseUri, parser)</code>,\netc. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2055\">2055</a></li>\n<li>Updated the <code>button</code> tag configuration to include a space between multiple button elements in the <code>Element.text()</code>\nmethod. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2105\">2105</a></li>\n<li>Added support for the <code>ns|*</code> all elements in namespace Selector. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1811\">1811</a></li>\n<li>When normalising attribute names during serialization, invalid characters are now replaced with <code>_</code>, vs being\nstripped. This should make the process clearer, and generally prevent an invalid attribute name being coerced\nunexpectedly. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2143\">2143</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed previously deprecated internal classes and methods. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2094\">2094</a></li>\n<li>Build change: the built jar's OSGi manifest no longer imports itself. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2158\">2158</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When tracking source positions, if the first node was a TextNode, its position was incorrectly set\nto <code>-1.</code> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2106\">2106</a></li>\n<li>When connecting (or redirecting) to URLs with characters such as <code>{</code>, <code>}</code> in the path, a Malformed URL exception would\nbe thrown (if in development), or the URL might otherwise not be escaped correctly (if in\nproduction).
