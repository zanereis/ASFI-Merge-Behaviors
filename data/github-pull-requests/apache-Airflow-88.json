hit this when trying to set up a contributor’s Windows PC for development. The Windows host talks to a WSL2 container with a Docker context (if you enable it in Docker Desktop) and it would show up in `docker context ls`, and Breeze’s detection code can mistakenly select it for building an image and fail. This adds explicit logic to exclude those contexts so Breeze can find a more appropriate one.","created_at":"2023-08-20T06:58:47Z","updated_at":"2023-08-24T14:28:00Z","closed_at":"2023-08-24T13:59:46Z","merged_at":"2023-08-24T13:59:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"df7c170e55dd9af894947219fb8025d3387505bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769003317,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5MDAzMzE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:dev-tools","name":"area:dev-tools","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/33547/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/33547/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/33547/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/7eddc4a03af230bb40d0b5ef1c304c2828397fe7","head":{"label":"astronomer:avoid-wsl2-desktop-linux-context","ref":"avoid-wsl2-desktop-linux-context","sha":"7eddc4a03af230bb40d0b5ef1c304c2828397fe7","user":{"login":"astronomer","id":12449437,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNDQ5NDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12449437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer","html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65323404,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTMyMzQwNA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"astronomer/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"astronomer","id":12449437,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNDQ5NDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12449437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer","html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.gi

The proposal introduces SLAs that are measured and contained within the lifetime of a Dag Run, and within the lifetime of a Task Instance which cost significantly less for the Airflow Infrastructure to compute than the existing concept of SLAs. The proposed SLA callback functions will also accept the TI context as the argument, which is a parameter that is used by other callback types (on_success_callback, on_failure_callback, on_execute_callback) to honor a consistent interface.\r\n\r\n### Dag Updates\r\n#### Added \r\n        sla: timedelta | None = None\r\n        on_sla_miss_callback: None | DagStateChangeCallback | list[DagStateChangeCallback] = None\r\n\r\n#### Marked for Deprecation\r\n        sla_miss_callback: None | SLAMissCallback | list[SLAMissCallback] = None\r\n\r\n### Dag Run DB Updates\r\n#### Added \r\n        sla_missed = Column(Boolean, default=False)\r\n\r\n### DagCallbackRequest Updates (callback_data json payload)\r\n#### Added\r\n        sla_miss: bool | None = False\r\n        dagrun_state: DagRunState\r\n#### Removed\r\n        is_failure_callback: bool | None = True\r\n\r\n### Dag SLA Measurement Semantics \r\nSLA tracking logic is evaluated when the active Dag Run is checked for updates using DagRun.update_state which is executed in the main scheduling loop. Dag SLA is tracked for all run types except for DagRunType.BACKFILL_JOB if **sla** parameter is provided in the Dag definition. \r\n\r\nIf **sla_missed** attribute of the Dag Run is already set to True, the scheduler loop will skip the SLA check for that dag run. This condition ensures that the SLA miss callback is generated only once when a scheduler loop has detected that the dag run has just missed its SLA and has been made the corresponding Dag Run record update in the DB.\r\n\r\nSLA is measured against the time between the Dag Run start_date (time) and the current time. If SLA is less than the time between the current time and the Dag Run start_date, SLA has been missed for the active Dag Run. Using the start_date (instead of the scheduled start time according to the time table) allows us to keep a consistent measuring pattern across MANUAL and SCHEDULED run types, and keep the SLA evaluation logic simple for the initial version of this feature.\r\n\r\nSLA callback is indicated by the sla_miss boolean flag on DagCallbackRequest. The State of the DagRun corresponding to the DagCallbackRequest is propagated through the dagrun_state parameter, which is also used to deduce whether a on_success_callback or a on_failure_callback must be executed along with the request. It is now possible for a DagCallbackRequest to be issued without a finished DagRun State (SUCCESS or FAILED); it is upto dagrun.handle_callback function to parse the parameters and execute the appropriate callback related to the given DagRun State or sla_miss flag.\r\n\r\n### Question:\r\nDo we need to consider the impact of removing is_failure_callback from DagCallbackRequest and replacing it with dagrun_state? If DbCallbackRequest is enabled and unexecuted DagCallbackRequests are stored in the DB at the time of DB upgrade, would it lead to some callbacks not being executed?\r\nEDIT: I've added an alembic migration step that unpacks the json callback_data and programmatically updates the json payload with the logical mapping of is_failure_callback <-> dagrun_state for DagCallbackRequest callback_types of DbCallbackRequest records. I wanted to get others' thoughts on whether this suggestion improves the reliability of the migration or makes it more risky.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^

ExternalTaskSensor works fine for both DST and non-DST \r\nwhen no execution_delta is used. But, when execution_delta is \r\nused, on DST switch days, the new child DAG/task runs as per the \r\nswitched time but the parent DAG cannot match the child DAGs for \r\nthe execution_delta DAGs runs that have run in the old time before \r\nthe DST switch and it just hangs forever. We handle this care here \r\nby calculating the change for the DST switch in case of execution_delta \r\nand when the DAG has a non-UTC timezone.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

are different ways users supply the hostname(account url) in Azure, sometimes the host doesn't have a urlparse.scheme but has urlparse.path e.g. name.blob.windows.net and other times, it will just be Azure ID e.g. aldhjf9dads. While working on #32980, I assumed that if there's no scheme, then the hostname is not valid, that's incorrect since DNS can serve as the host.\r\nThe fix was to check if we don't have netloc and that urlparse.path does not include a dot and if it does not, use the login/account_name to construct the account_url\r\n\r\nCloses:

is the following PR to https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/33196 and intends to solve the issue that the soft_fail argument might not work on all sensors.\r\n\r\nThis pull request addresses the issue of running BatchSensor in deferrable mode with `soft_fail=True` still raises an `AirflowException`, which should be `AirflowSkipException`. As `raise_failed_or_skiping_exception` won't exist in `BaseSensorOperator` before airflow (probably 2.7.1?), I add it to `airflow.providers.amazon.aws.sensors`. Not sure whether it's the correct way to do so. If so, I'll continue work on fixing other providers' sensors as well\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

with catchup=False, CronTriggerTimetable would aggressively cut off a run if the scheduler doesn't ask to schedule the next run immediately. This causes DAGs to seemingly mysteriously \"miss\" a run from time to time due to the scheduler inevitably having a very slight hiccup.\r\n\r\nThis change makes the timetable's non-catchup cutoff logic a little more lax, and only activate when the scheduler misses at least an entire interval. For example, for a daily cron, if the previous run happened on midnight of 2nd Jun (to cover 1st Jun), the timetable would still allow scheduling a run covering 2nd Jun if the scheduler asks for it some time during the 2nd, and would skip the 2nd Jun run entirely only if the scheduler fails to ask for a run on the entirety of the 2nd and only asks after midnight on the 3rd.\r\n\r\nAs discussed in #27399, I feel this is the more reasonable fix than #32921, even though it slightly changes the behaviour (specifically, the first ever run would start one interval earlier than previously). Quoting from the linked issue:\r\n\r\n> > I think a reasonable logic would be to change the catchup=False logic to cover one schedule before the current time instead, so in the above scenario, the timetable would make the next run cover 4am, and only skip the 4am run if the current time is pas 5am.\r\n>\r\n> Sounds good. It's natural to those who are used to Cron and Anacron.\r\n>\r\n> I think we need to document the new behavior. […]\r\n\r\nFix #27339. Close

is the following PR to https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/33196 and intends to solve the issue that the soft_fail argument might not work on all sensors.\r\n\r\nThis pull request addresses the issue of the core async sensors potentially raising non-AirflowSkipException even when `soft_fail` is set to True. It achieves this by modifying the `DateTimeTrigger` to include the `soft_fail` argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNot related to this PR: I noticed that we are currently using separate sensors for synchronous and asynchronous operations in our core sensors. Do you think it would be beneficial to merge them into a single sensor, like what the providers do?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
