Summary\r\nCurrent Lexers convert a back-slash plus another character sequence (e.g. `\\[`) to double back-slash plus the next character (e.g. `\\\\[`).\r\nBut from detailed analysis (see below), it seems the conversion is wrong and it should leave such characters as it is. \r\n\r\n## Details\r\nI debugged how Lexer works, and found that:\r\n\r\n- The `ESC` fragment handles an escaped special character in String representation. I.e. String `\\t` will be converted to actual tab character.\r\n- The string values user input from NiFi UI are passed to `RecordPath.compile` method as it is. E.g. the input string `replaceRegex(/name, '\\[', '')` is passed to as is, then the single back-slash is converted to double back-slash by the ESC fragment line 155.\r\n- I believe the line 153-156 is aimed to preserve escaped characters as it is, because such escape doesn't mean anything for the RecordPath/AttrExpLang spec. And those should be unescaped later by underlying syntaxes such as RegEx.\r\n    - And current line 155 does it wrongly. It should append a single back-slash..\r\n    - Other Lexers (AttributeExpressionLexer.g and HL7QueryLexer.g) have the same issue.\r\n- So, I think we should fix all Lexers instead of adding another conversion.\r\n\r\nHere is the [Lexer code](https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/master/nifi-commons/nifi-record-path/src/main/antlr3/org/apache/nifi/record/path/RecordPathLexer.g#L143) for reference:\r\n```\r\n143 fragment\r\n144 ESC\r\n145   :  '\\\\'\r\n146     (\r\n147         '\"'    { setText(\"\\\"\"); }\r\n148       |  '\\''  { setText(\"\\'\"); }\r\n149       |  'r'   { setText(\"\\r\"); }\r\n150       |  'n'   { setText(\"\\n\"); }\r\n151       |  't'   { setText(\"\\t\"); }\r\n152       |  '\\\\'  { setText(\"\\\\\\\\\"); }\r\n153       |  nextChar = ~('\"' | '\\'' | 'r' | 'n' | 't' | '\\\\')\r\n154        {\r\n155          StringBuilder lBuf = new StringBuilder(); lBuf.append(\"\\\\\\\\\").appendCodePoint(nextChar); setText(lBuf.toString());\r\n156        }\r\n157    )\r\n158  ;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## NiFi template for test\r\n\r\nHere is a NiFi flow template to test how before/after this change.\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/ijokarumawak/b6bdca8074a4457bc4a425b90a6b17f0\r\n\r\nIn order to try the template, you need to build this PR as NiFi 1.9.0-SNAPSHOT, then download following 1.8.0 nars in your SNAPSHOT's lib dir, so that both versions can be used in the flow.\r\n\r\n- https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/nifi/nifi-standard-nar/1.8.0/nifi-standard-nar-1.8.0.nar\r\n- https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/nifi/nifi-update-attribute-nar/1.8.0/nifi-update-attribute-nar-1.8.0.nar\r\n\r\n## Test result\r\n\r\n### UpdateAttribute test for backward compatibility\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1107620/49493740-93078700-f8a0-11e8-9360-025254b39551.png)\r\n\r\nGenerateFlowFile generates FlowFiles with attribute `a` whose value is:\r\n```\r\nthis is new line\r\nand this is just a backslash \\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1107620/49493751-9c90ef00-f8a0-11e8-8d41-6005f01157a7.png)\r\n\r\nResult\r\n1.8.0\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1107620/49493779-b5010980-f8a0-11e8-9911-22c0d71e865b.png)\r\n\r\n1.9.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1107620/49493786-baf6ea80-f8a0-11e8-8c04-7efb54167345.png)\r\n\r\n### UpdateRecord test illustrating the NIFI-5826 issue is addressed\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1107620/49493825-e083f400-f8a0-11e8-8b4a-cf17e370282e.png)\r\n\r\nGenerateFlowFile generates content:\r\n```\r\nkey,value\r\non[e,1\r\n[two,2\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1107620/49493836-e8439880-f8a0-11e8-8e89-f07db2712690.png)\r\n\r\nResult\r\n1.8.0\r\nRegex compilation error as reported\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1107620/49493844-f09bd380-f8a0-11e8-822f-f747f3184fc5.png)\r\n\r\n1.9.0-SNAPSHOT\r\nThe square brackets are converted successfully\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1107620/49493863-03160d00-f8a1-11e8-8f11-ac95670412ed.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

has a function that allows it to throw an exception after a certain number of records have been read. This feature is not working at all, and instead the reader fails immediately without reading any records.\r\n\r\nThe two unit tests that use this (TestSplitRecord.testReadFailure and TestConvertRecord.testReadFailure) both work because they route to Failure on any error in the read, but you can see the error in the console.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm working on a custom processor using this test class for testing. My processor interfaces with an external system and sends batches of data. In some cases a read failure could cause a partial load to a remote system, and we need to be able to check for this.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

a component.\r\n\r\n- Found several instances of nifi-framework-api's ProviderException being thrown from processors. Changed those to IllegalStateException, as ProviderException is not an appropriate Exception in those cases, and extensions should not depend on nifi-framework-api.\r\n- Performed some cleanup, moving Property Descriptors from Controller Service API's/specs into the implementations. Adding to the Service API results in bringing in nifi-utils to the nifi-standard-services-api-nar, which is a bad practice. The 'main' service api nar should not have a dependency on a util class.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

escaped backslash by unescaping it in java just before compiling regex.\r\n-----\r\nFor a consistency with expression language regex-based evaluators, all record path operators will follow the same escape sequence for regex. Single backslash should be defined as double backslash.\r\nExamples:\r\n- replaceRegex(/col1, '\\\\s', \"_\") - will replace all whitespaces (spaces, tabs) with underscore.\r\n- replaceRegex(/col1, '\\\\.', \",\") - will replace all a period with\r\n- replaceRegex(/col1, '\\\\\\\\', \"/\") - will replace backslash with forward slash\r\n\r\nEL References: StringLiteralEvaluator. Special characters (backslash sequences) will be handled for any string literal value, and will affect the way regex and escaped chars must be defined. Same logic has been added to RecordPathUtils.unescapeBackslash.\r\n\r\n-----\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

RunNiFi.java to add libs need to run on Java 11 when it is the detected runtime java version and grant access to the necessary module (java.xml.bind) when running on Java 9 or 10\r\nAdded dependencies/includes/excludes to nifi-assembly configurations for enabling NiFi to run on Java 11\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new directory under the lib directory which contains jaxb, annotation, and activation jars.  To test the PR:\r\n\r\n1. Build with Java 1.8\r\n1. Start a new terminal and make sure that JAVA_HOME is set to Java 11, via update-alternatives, jenv, etc\r\n1. Start NiFi with Java 11\r\n1. Test processors that utilize JAXB capabilities and reference classes from the activation/annotation libraries, like PutEmail/ExtractEmailAttachments/InvokeGRPC (generated code, which contains the `@Generated` annotation)\r\n1. Test components that use VirtualMachineMetrics, like AmbariReportingTask, DataDogReportingTask, ScriptedReportingTask, SiteToSiteMetricsReportingTask\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR introduces a new property in nifi.properties where you can specify a directory that will be watched for new NARs (defaults ./extensions), and upon finding them will make any extensions in those NARs available to the running application without requiring a restart.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR includes a refactoring of the ExtensionManager to remove it's static use and make it an instance that is injected everywhere. This will help make the framework code more testable going forward.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Currently the UI retrieves the available types during initial load of the UI and never retrieves them again because they couldn't change, so this will have to be changed in a follow on PR.\r\n\r\nSome scenarios to consider when testing...\r\n\r\n- Dependencies across NARs - handled by keeping track of skipped NARs until the a new NAR is available matching the required dependency\r\n\r\n- NARs still being written - handled by only consider the NAR once the last modified time is at least 5 seconds old\r\n \r\n- Custom UIs - make sure the custom UI is available for a component that was auto-loaded\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-31T20:24:16Z","updated_at":"2021-06-18T07:16:13Z","closed_at":"2018-11-01T18:42:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"47fb4b4a9f7ad21970b422c7cbf57eadd2bd880a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3119/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3119/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3119/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/f855fb8f80bdfeebb6301ab8e7a70424164fcbf2","head":{"label":"bbende:NIFI-5673","ref":"NIFI-5673","sha":"f855fb8f80bdfeebb6301ab8e7a70424164fcbf2","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":48186740,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0ODE4Njc0MA==","name":"nifi","full_name":"bbende/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bbende/nifi","description":"Mirror

PR is based on #2361. To preserve @adamlamar's credit, please do not squash the first commit when merging. Thanks!\r\n\r\nThe 2nd commit avoids updating `currentKeys` during the listing loop. Before this fix, it's easy to reproduce duplicated list with a small number of objects. E.g 10 objects to S3 uploaded at the same time, ListS3 can produce 27 FlowFiles. Using min age doesn't address the issue.\r\n\r\nPlease use [the template file attached to the JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12946341/ListS3_Duplication.xml) to reproduce.\r\n\r\nAfter applying this fix, I confirmed ListS3 can produce FlowFiles without duplication. I tested 10,000 objects were listed without duplication while those were uploaded by PutS3 and listed by ListS3 simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
