Specifically, replica and offlineReplica information is missing from the implementation, which can cause buggy behavior in the future (e.g. if waitForPartitionMetadataCondition is used to wait on replica info). This patch only adds replica info. This should ideally match ZK impl completely, but it seems non-trivial to add offlineReplica information (requires addition of listenerName to signature potentially, which means modifying the parent method)\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

PR includes \r\n- Recognize the fetch requests with out of range local log offsets\r\n- Add fetch implementation for the data lying in the range of [logStartOffset, localLogStartOffset]\r\n- Add a new purgatory for async remote read requests which are served through a specific thread pool\r\n\r\nWe have an extended version of remote fetch that can fetch from multiple remote partitions in parallel, which we will raise as a followup PR.\r\n\r\nA few tests for the newly introduced changes are added in this PR. There are some tests available for these scenarios in 2.8.x, refactoring with the trunk changes, will add them in followup PRs.\r\n\r\nOther contributors: \r\nkamal.chandraprakash@gmail.com - Further improvements and adding a few tests\r\nshowuon@gmail.com - Added a few test cases for these changes.\r\n\r\nPS: This functionality is pulled out from internal branches with other functionalities related to the feature in 2.8.x. The reason for not pulling all the changes as it makes the PR huge, and burdensome to review and it also needs other metrics, minor enhancements(including perf), and minor changes done for tests. So, we will try to have followup PRs to cover all those.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI

For this reason, we actually don't know if the consumer has a valid position or not.\r\n\r\nWe should just swallow a timeout if the consumer cannot get the position from the broker, and try the next partition.

UINT32 does not save us any bytes, compared to using INT32; both are 4 bytes. Also note, the value we encode is a byte-array size, and arrays in Java have a max size of `Integer.MAX_VALUE` anyway, so we could just encode as INT32 without risk. Using UINT32 does not provide any advantage as we don't need the \"enlarged positive integer space\" anyway, and we have weird cast/overflow stuff in the current code for no reason.\r\n\r\nThe original discussion on the KIP was about reducing serialized byte size, so using varint seems to be the right choice.\r\n\r\nIf we don't care about varint, I would at least like to simplify the code to use INT32. UNIT32 just seem not to be a good choices

shuts the broker down when it encounters an issue trying to process feature change events, but it does not distinguish between issues related to feature changes actually failing and other exceptions like ZooKeeper session expiration.  This introduces the possibility that Zookeeper session expiration could cause the broker to shutdown, which is not intended.  This patch updates the code to distinguish between these two types of exceptions and in the case of something like a ZK session expiration it logs a warning and continues.  We shutdown the broker only for `FeatureCacheUpdateException`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage

a broker has some issues about network, the broker can not connect to zookeeper and controller.At this time, we replace this broker with a new broker that has a same `broker.id` with fault broker, and we can not  stop the Kafka process on fault broker because of network issue. So the client can still connect this broker and can produce and consume messages normally.  But the data on fault broker maybe be lost because there are some leader for partitions on the fault broker. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, we can check  broker configuration (for example: broker ip)  when broker reconnects to zookeeper and broker can exist if broker's configuration is not same with

[KAFKA-14858](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14858):\r\n\r\n> In distributed mode, if a connector throws an exception from its taskConfigs method (invoked by the herder, through the Worker class, [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/f3e4dd922933bf28b2c091e846cbc4e5255dd1d5/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/distributed/DistributedHerder.java#L1960)), we wait for an exponential backoff period (see [KAFKA-14732](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14732)) and then [retry the operation](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/f3e4dd922933bf28b2c091e846cbc4e5255dd1d5/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/distributed/DistributedHerder.java#L1907-L1911).\r\n>\r\n> However, in standalone mode, not only do we not retry the operation, we do not even log the exception. In addition, when REST calls are made that require generating new task configs for a connector (which include creating and reconfiguring a connector), if the connector's taskConfigs method throws an exception, those requests will time out since the [callback](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/f3e4dd922933bf28b2c091e846cbc4e5255dd1d5/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/standalone/StandaloneHerder.java#L183) we use to respond to those requests never gets invoked.\r\n>\r\n> At a bare minimum, we should:\r\n> \r\n> - Log any exceptions thrown from the taskConfigs method at ERROR level\r\n> - Invoke any callbacks passed in to the relevant StandaloneHerder methods with any exceptions thrown by the taskConfigs method\r\n>\r\n> We might also consider introducing the same kind of exponential backoff retry logic used by distributed mode, but this can be addressed separately since it would be a much larger change in behavior and may break existing user's deployments.\r\n\r\n- This patch handles exceptions thrown from `Connector::taskConfigs` by either logging the exception or completing callbacks exceptionally as appropriate (in the `StandaloneHerder`).\r\n- As discussed in [KAFKA-14746](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14746), the infinite retry mechanism in distributed mode likely never intended to cover exceptions thrown from `Connector::taskConfigs` (which is something we might want to remove in the future) and this patch therefore doesn't introduce a similar retry mechanism here.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

I've verified and made sure the only case that `task` would be null and not stream task would be in testing code only, with pausing / resuming topologies; I've revamped the restoration recording func, mainly to make just one method on the Task interface, to make sure we would never get `task == null` and do not need to cast to `StreamTask`.\r\n2) Use `numRecords` directly to avoid calling `records.size()` that triggers concurrent modifications.\r\n3) Rewrite the TaskMetricsTest to not use the removed impl functions.\r\n4) Found an issue while fixing 1) above, turns out it's related to pausing tasks: if the tasks are paused due to instance / named-topologies are paused while they need restoration, the restoration would never finish, and hence the instance's state would not transit to RUNNING. Similarly, if user paused just one of the named-topology right at the beginning, since the state would not transit to RUNNING, every tasks across all named-topologies would not make progress. We keep the behavior as is to be consistent with and without state-updater.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

Description\r\nThis adds a couple tests. \r\n\r\nFirst, it adds a test that makes sure we handle what happens when a reassignment completes and none of the new replicas can be made leader. Its important we dont keep an old replica as leader.\r\n\r\nSecond, it adds a test that makes sure we handle new reassignments that dont include a previous assignment replica that was leader. In the test here (in `testReassignPartitionsKeepsAllPreviousReassigningReplicas`) that replica is broker 2. We first reassign the partition from [0, 1] to [2, 3]. Then elect 2 leader after its joined the ISR. 3 does not join the ISR so the reassignment is not complete. Then we reassign the partition again to [3, 4]. The important part is we arent stuck with 2 being leader and it being removed from the replicas list. In KRaft we dont remove it from the replicas list so its OK it stays as leader.

patch adds the `EventAccumulator ` which will be used in the runtime of the new group coordinator. The aim of this queue is to basically have a queue per __consumer_group partitions and to ensure that events addressed to the same partitions are not processed concurrently. The dispatcher is generic so we could reuse it in different context.\r\n\r\nI am not really happy with the name but I could not come up with something better. I am open to suggestions.\r\n\r\nThis patch is part of a series which will bring the new group coordinator runtime. I will open them more or less class by class in order to facilitate the reviews.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

the WorkerSinkTask fails when a subscribed topic is deleted and the RebalanceListener tries to fetch the position of such a topic. Note that this doesn't happen whenever a topic is deleted but instead under extreme scenarios like mass deletion of topics. To get around this, Admin Client has been added to WorkerSinkTask. When RebalanceListener is invoked, and a TimeoutException is thrown upon fetching position, it is checked if the topic exists. If it doesn't, then the offset of that TopicPartition isn't committed and the deleted topic name is cached so that any future position fetch for other partitions of the deleted topic doesn't invoke AdminClient again. Note that there could be a case when the topic might get recreated and the caching might prohibit committing offsets. But it seems like an extreme scenario and AFAIK, it the topic gets assigned to the consumer again, then the RebalanceListener would be invoked again. If the topic exists, then the error is rethrown to fail the task.\r\n\r\nThe test scenario in the JIRA is the one where I could replicate the issue and I have tested locally to observe the connector/task doesn't fail.\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-05T16:41:32Z","updated_at":"2025-02-02T03:35:19Z","closed_at":"2025-02-02T03:35:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

still have -1 as producer epoch when it transitions to Dead.\r\n\r\nWhen a transaction metadata is created for the first time (in handleInitProducerId), it has -1 as its producer epoch. Then a producer epoch is attributed and the transaction coordinator tries to persist the change. If the write fail for instance because there is an under min isr, the transaction metadata remains with its epoch as -1 forever or until the init producer id is retried.\r\n\r\nThis means that it is possible for transaction metadata to remain with -1 as producer epoch until it gets expired. At the moment, this is not allowed because we enforce a producer epoch greater or equals to 0 in prepareTransitionTo.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

java.util.Random to generate every byte sent from the ProducerPerformance appears to be a limiting factor. Throughput of the ProducerPerformance script is higher with a file of example records as compared to randomly generated records with `--record-size`.\r\n\r\nOn my machine a single thread can generate ~100MB/second of uppercase letters using java.util.Random and ~300MB/sec using java.util.SplittableRandom. This is a limit on throughput.\r\n\r\nNote: you can optimise further by expanding it from 26 letters to 32 letter generated as it is more efficient to generate a nicely distributed int when the bound is a power of two.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-31T02:59:45Z","updated_at":"2023-03-31T06:52:19Z","closed_at":"2023-03-31T06:52:10Z","merged_at":"2023-03-31T06:52:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"2b26db0d38f7245505812e4cb3fa622fc07ba6c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13482/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13482/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13482/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/82519e5e714fbaf80323e66771090dd18428c520","head":{"label":"robobario:producer-perf-splittable-random","ref":"producer-perf-splittable-random","sha":"82519e5e714fbaf80323e66771090dd18428c520","user":{"login":"robobario","id":1667008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjcwMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1667008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robobario","html_url":"https://github.com/robobario","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robobario/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robobario/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robobario/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robobario/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robobario/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robobario/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robobario/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robobario/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robobario/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":90212306,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MDIxMjMwNg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"robobario/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"robobario","id":1667008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjcwMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1667008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robobario","html_url":"https://github.com/robobario","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robobario/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robobario/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robobario/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robobario/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robobario/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robobario/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robobario/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robobario/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robobario/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/robobario/kafka","description":"Mirror

Description\r\nA couple tests in TopicCommandIntegrationTest look flaky, such as `testTopicDeletion` and `testTopicWithCollidingCharDeletionAndCreateAgain`.\r\n\r\nThis should make them less flaky. Before the change I ran `testTopicDeletion` 100 times and it failed about 26 times in KRaft mode. After the change it failed 0 times out of 100.\r\n\r\nI also updated part of a comment that implies the code only runs in ZK mode but thats not the case so I removed it.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-30T15:17:30Z","updated_at":"2023-03-30T22:25:15Z","closed_at":"2023-03-30T22:25:15Z","merged_at":"2023-03-30T22:25:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"b77b7a6f6f6d39f8064fc5fb11f25b09c58c4228","assignee":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13479/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13479/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13479/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/9ff8c80e65cb548e840f1339234cf6fc7176e345","head":{"label":"andymg3:deflake-TopicCommandIntegrationTest","ref":"deflake-TopicCommandIntegrationTest","sha":"9ff8c80e65cb548e840f1339234cf6fc7176e345","user":{"login":"andymg3","id":97484553,"node_id":"U_kgDOBc9_CQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97484553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3","html_url":"https://github.com/andymg3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":475882650,"node_id":"R_kgDOHF1kmg","name":"kafka","full_name":"andymg3/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andymg3","id":97484553,"node_id":"U_kgDOBc9_CQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97484553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3","html_url":"https://github.com/andymg3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andymg3/kafka","description":"Mirror

PR adds the GroupMetadataManager to the group-coordinator module. This manager is responsible for handling the groups management, the members management and the entire reconciliation process. At this point, only the new consumer group type/protocol is implemented.\r\n\r\nAs you will see, the new manager is based on an architecture inspired from the quorum controller. A request can access/read the state but can't mutate it directly. Instead, a list of records is generated together with the response and those records will be applied to the state by the runtime framework. We use timeline data structures. Note that the runtime framework is not part of this PR. It will come in a following one.\r\n\r\nFor the reviewers, I suggest starting from the GroupMetadataManager.consumerGroupHeartbeat method. From there, you will how the consumer group heartbeat is handled and how all the classes fit together. Then, it is possible to review the classes independently, I suppose.\r\n\r\nNote that I have diverged from the KIP in a few places. Firstly, I have adapted to assignor interface to be more convenient with the internals. This is something that we could still change. Secondly, I have adapted a few records. Especially, I have changed how the current state of the member is persisted. The way that we had in the KIP was a but naive and not practical at all for the implementation.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

Description\r\nThis is a small patch to make it so we only create one `FeatureControlManager` instance in `ReplicationControlManagerTest`. Currently we create two, which isn't needed. Its also a bit confusing because the `ReplicationControlTestContext` objects ends up having a different `FeatureControlManager` reference that the one its own `ReplicationControlManager` instance has a reference to. \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nRan `./gradlew metadata:test --tests org.apache.kafka.controller.ReplicationControlManagerTest` locally\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-28T20:04:56Z","updated_at":"2023-03-30T02:10:04Z","closed_at":"2023-03-30T02:10:04Z","merged_at":"2023-03-30T02:10:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"887d05559f36fee94389988405724b509a84c46c","assignee":{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13468/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13468/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13468/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/d97e016ad2c9422af97d74e3b39042bccb83a237","head":{"label":"andymg3:minor-remove-extra-feature-control-manager","ref":"minor-remove-extra-feature-control-manager","sha":"d97e016ad2c9422af97d74e3b39042bccb83a237","user":{"login":"andymg3","id":97484553,"node_id":"U_kgDOBc9_CQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97484553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3","html_url":"https://github.com/andymg3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":475882650,"node_id":"R_kgDOHF1kmg","name":"kafka","full_name":"andymg3/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andymg3","id":97484553,"node_id":"U_kgDOBc9_CQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97484553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3","html_url":"https://github.com/andymg3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andymg3/kafka","description":"Mirror

another project we are working on, we have faced an issue when trying to read the file at the same time it's being writen by a heavy process.\r\n\r\nThis change is already applied in our repository, surpassing errors on corrupted file, but we think this change can be beneficial for other teams or projects.\r\n\r\nIt's supper simple, just move out from the `try-catch` block everything that is not related with IO operations (type checks, in memory object loops, ...). That frees the resource and, if it got write before closing, we don't face a `java.io.StreamCorruptedException: unexpected EOF in middle of data block` exception.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

MetadataLoader is not supposed to publish metadata updates until we have loaded up to the high water mark. Previously, this logic was broken, and we published updates immediately. This PR fixes that and adds a junit test.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that the MetadataLoader previously assumed that we would periodically get callbacks from the Raft layer even if nothing had happened. We relied on this to install new publishers in a timely fashion, for example. However, in older MetadataVersions that don't include NoOpRecord, this is not a safe assumption.","created_at":"2023-03-27T22:27:00Z","updated_at":"2023-03-29T19:30:17Z","closed_at":"2023-03-29T19:30:13Z","merged_at":"2023-03-29T19:30:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"09e59bc7761a6b9ec1437b3decdfcd7b5fff868e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13462/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13462/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13462/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/53aec56ad232247d38eca1a879079164c40e7faf","head":{"label":"cmccabe:KAFKA-14857","ref":"KAFKA-14857","sha":"53aec56ad232247d38eca1a879079164c40e7faf","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

patch adds support for handling metadata snapshots while in dual-write mode. Prior to this change, if the active controller loaded a snapshot, it would get out of sync with the ZK state.\r\n\r\nIn order to reconcile the snapshot state with ZK, several methods were added to scan through the metadata in ZK to compute differences with the MetadataImage. Since this introduced a lot of code, I opted to split out a lot of methods from ZkMigrationClient into their own client interfaces. \r\n\r\n* TopicMigrationClient\r\n* ConfigMigrationClient\r\n* AclMigrationClient\r\n\r\nEach of these has some iterator method that lets the caller examine the ZK state in a single pass and without using too much memory.","created_at":"2023-03-27T21:46:33Z","updated_at":"2023-05-05T08:35:26Z","closed_at":"2023-05-05T08:35:26Z","merged_at":"2023-05-05T08:35:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"0822ce0ed1a106a510930bc9ac53a266f54684d7","assignee":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13461/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13461/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13461/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/8473ca69a9bee0812cf89e695be4331d66b85fc7","head":{"label":"mumrah:KAFKA-14840-kraft-snapshot-dual-write","ref":"KAFKA-14840-kraft-snapshot-dual-write","sha":"8473ca69a9bee0812cf89e695be4331d66b85fc7","user":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5542805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTQyODA1","name":"kafka","full_name":"mumrah/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah/kafka","description":"Mirror

motivation for introducing InMemoryLeaderEpochCheckpoint is to allow remote log manager to create the RemoteLogSegmentMetadata(RLSM) with the correct leader epoch info for a specific segment. To do that, we need to rely on the LeaderEpochCheckpointCache to truncate from start and end, to get the epoch info. However, we don't really want to truncate the epochs in cache (and write to checkpoint file in the end). So, we introduce this InMemoryLeaderEpochCheckpoint to feed into LeaderEpochCheckpointCache, and when we truncate the epoch for RLSM, we can do them in memory without affecting the checkpoint file, and without interacting with file system.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

fast consecutive rebalances where a task is revoked from one worker and assigned to another one, it has been observed that there is a small time window and thus a race condition during which a RUNNING status record in the new generation is produced and is immediately followed by a delayed UNASSIGNED status record belonging to the same or a previous generation before the worker that sends this message reads the RUNNING status record that corresponds to the latest generation.\r\nAlthough this doesn't inhibit the actual execution of tasks, it reports an incorrect status for those tasks(i.e UNASSIGNED). If the users have setup some kind of monitoring on tasks status then this could lead to false alarms for example.\r\nThis PR aims to solve this problem by checking if a status message is stale after reading it and updates it's status only when it is safe to. Note that it uses the same method `canWriteSafely` to check the staleness, so if needed, that method can be renamed (which I haven't done in this PR). Also, the original description of the ticket only talks about RUNNING/UNASSIGNED state but this PR should ideally help in filtering out all stale messages (which might still be infrequent but worth handling

practice, I found that when I configure a mirror checkpoint connector, because the source cluster has a large number of group or the number of group under a topic changes frequently, the connector will frequently rebalance between its tasks, although there is no change in the synchronized group list of the configuration. \r\nI don't think connector should rebalance frequently in this case to affect  group synchronization tasks without any group changes.\r\nIn this PR, MirrorCheckpointConnector avoids the rabalance interference caused by the addition and deletion of irrelevant groups ([KAFKA-14837](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14837)), and reduces the rpc calls of \"listConsumerGroupOffsets\" in each task about irrelevant groups

server side as well to take some load off the client. The group coordinator either directly computes the new target assignment for the group based on its default server-side assignor or requests a new assignment from one of the members in the group. \r\n\r\nThe server side assignor is pluggable and the client can choose the one that it wants to use by providing its name in the heartbeat request. If the selected assignor does not exist, the group coordinator will reject the heartbeat with an UNSUPPORTED_ASSIGNOR error.\r\n\r\nThere will be two types of assignors :- Range, Uniform. This PR is for the **Server side range assignor.**\r\n\r\nThis range assignor is very different from the old client side implementation. We added functionality to make these assignments sticky while also inheriting crucial properties of the range assignor such as facilitating joins and distributing partitions of a topic somewhat equally amongst its subscribers.\r\n\r\nThere are a few data structure changes from the KIP in the AssignmentMemberSpec file and the MemberAssignment file, these have been approved but they aren't reflected in the KIP yet.\r\n\r\nThe tests aim to cover all the possible cases when a re-assignment can be triggered.\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-23T20:15:00Z","updated_at":"2023-05-10T12:09:13Z","closed_at":"2023-05-10T12:09:12Z","merged_at":"2023-05-10T12:09:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"4653507926a42dccda5c086fcae6278afcfc53ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4771354362,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABHGUW-g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-848","name":"KIP-848","color":"0E87F1","default":false,"description":"The
