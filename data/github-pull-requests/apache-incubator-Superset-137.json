Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nIf you have a large number of tables with a single schema (we have 28k in one of ours), it would take about 10 seconds to load the table selector. This was due to generating the search index, tokenizing, and doing other search-y related things. It turns out that getting rid of the indexing and adding `ignoreAccents={false}` (the same thing as https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7791) improves the loading speed (down to under half a second) without hurting the search speed.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n- ensure searching for tables in sql lab still works\r\n- see that it's faster!\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the performance experienced with the tagging system, in 3 ways:\r\n\r\n1. Mutations only happen if the feature flag is enabled;\r\n2. The `tagged_object` table now has an index to improve queries;\r\n3. The migration script setting the initial tags is much faster.\r\n\r\n<!-- ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nI deleted all tags and tag associations and ran the script. Tags were recreated correctly. This was also tested in staging with real data back in April.\r\n\r\nI also verified that the query reported by @graceguo-supercat (https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/7807) is using the index.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

CATEGORY\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [X] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nAdds the ability to replace or extend the caching backend in Superset by passing a function via the `CACHE_CONFIG` configuration option. The initialization function should return a custom caching module instance that is compatible with the Flask-Caching API.\r\n\r\nThis extension of functionality allows additional processing to be performed in the cache lifecycle to accommodate additional use cases, such as (de)serialization or encryption.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n1. Configure Superset with no `CACHE_CONFIG` value, ensure proper operation\r\n2. Configure Superset with standard `dict` `CACHE_CONFIG` value, ensure proper operation\r\n3. Configure Superset with custom init function `CACHE_CONFIG` value (see included documentation), ensure proper operation\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [X] Has associated issue: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/7855\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nShowing a stack trace can be a security hazard, as it can provide an attacker with environment-specific information that could be leveraged in an attack. While showing stacktraces can be useful in a dev/staging environment, it doesn't seem right to do it in production.\r\n\r\n`SHOW_STACKTRACE` had been introduced early in the project, but was not used/respected throughout the codebase. This PR converges all the code paths using the `traceback` python module (used to capture stack traces) through `utils.core.get_stacktrace()`, which does the right thing based on the `SHOW_STACKTRACE` config switch.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nMade sure that `traceback` module is only used through this utility function that checks the `SHOW_STACKTRACE` config key. Wrote unit test making sure the `get_stacktrace` convergence point does the right thing given`SHOW_STACKTRACE`.\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-11T05:00:21Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T00:36:55Z","closed_at":"2019-07-12T15:58:45Z","merged_at":"2019-07-12T15:58:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"87f50ba0d8fd33b9dd66fdc90759f3f670c649a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329203144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MjAzMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/M","name":"size/M","color":"705FA3","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"🏷️

logged in user can unintended consequences when caching is enabled. For example, if a where-clause references the `currenct_username()` function to filter only rows for the currently logged in user, the result will be cached with the same key that another user would get, despite both users getting different results from the `current_username()` function. This is because the rendered result of calling `current_username()` is never stored in the `query_obj` that is the basis for the cache key.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new function `cache_key_wrapper` to the jinja context, which can be wrapped around any function call, and stores the called values in a list `extra_cache_keys`, which are added to the `cache_dict` prior to hashing. This ensures that both users get unique values when referencing the same datasource. In practice this is done by \"compiling\" the query before calculation of the cache key, and storing all values that have been passed to `cache_key_wrapper`, which is then considered when calling the `cache_key` function in `viz.py` (legacy) and `query_context.py`/`query_object.py` (future). This adds some overhead, as the full SQLAlchemy selectable has to be generated and compiled once prior to cache key calculation, and again if there isn't a cache hit. The selectable could be easily stored and reused if there isn't a cache hit, but since the overhead is rather unnoticeable, I decided against it in favor of code readability.\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOT OF

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nin #7640 I added a change that prevent click event bubble up, so that clicking on anchor link will not trigger tab switch. But i just found this introduced a bug: if you click on tab's anchor link at the bottom of long dashboard, URLShortLinkButton can not re-position since there is no click event triggered, so it cause URLShortLinkButton show up in wired position.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nFix the click event handling in higher parent component. In click handler for `Tabs` component, I added logic to check event's target. It will switch tab when the event's target is not anchor link component.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

Specifically it: \r\n\r\n1. Removes empty UI options.\r\n2. Fixes an issue where `how` needed to be specified with `fill_method` which isn't a requirement for the the `resample` method. This has been resolved by using the the new `resample` method signature. \r\n3. Updates the Pandas [resample](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.resample.html#pandas.Series.resample) logic for `fill_method` and `how` is deprecated. Note previously both `how` (predominantly down-scaling) and `fill_method` (up-scaling) could be used simultaneously which was somewhat misleading. The new resampling logic simply uses a method many of which can be applied when either down- or up-scaling.\r\n\r\n  \r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

This is one of the enhancements that can be applicable to the core project.\r\nBasically, the changes add the possibility to translate the phrase 'No results found', which we can see when we use FilterBox in a report. When no option is available in select boxes of FilterBox, the phrase is displayed. The current implementation does not translate the phrase even if we add the message to messages.json (message.po) and we select the appropriate application language.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nIf we apply this contribution and we modify language messages, eg. Portuguese one, we can see something like this:\r\n![peek1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29867015/60344509-04329700-99b7-11e9-85b5-4947d573aa55.gif)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n-

the full table name. The slowness issue was due to `ignoreAccents` being set to true (details here: https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/3128). Datasource names should rarely have accented characters, so I think this is a fine fix\r\n \r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen we expand complex columns in SQL Lab, the original data is still presented. This is redundant, and for most rows the values will be partially truncated. Users have complained that this wastes valuable space when previewing wide tables, while at the same bringing very little information.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the results table so that complex columns are presented with `[...]` or `{...}` as the results, instead of the full values (which can be seen in the columns to its left). See the screenshots below:\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"852\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-06-25 at 11 27 08 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/60123416-47cd9c80-973c-11e9-83e8-0ffb7f1a02aa.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"509\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-06-25 at 11 27 33 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/60123424-4b612380-973c-11e9-8186-7f8d3af6740c.png\">\r\n\r\nNote that only **expanded** columns are truncated.

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nrelated to #7478  \r\nThis enables setting up an alternative URI for loading/storing/serving the examples data. New URI is defined with config key `SQLALCHEMY_EXAMPLES_URI`. If nothing not set explicitly, will default to point to the metadata database (`SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`). This in turn adds a new default entry to the `Database` model named `examples`\r\n\r\nAs a result, examples data tables can now be reused across Superset environments, and the tables don't get mixed in with the metadata database, leaving it cleaner.\r\n\r\n### Approach\r\n* allowing specifying an alternate database connection for examples\r\n* allowing a --only-metadata flag to `load_examples` to load only\r\n  dashboard and chart definitions, no actual data is loaded\r\n* fixed a bunch of tests that are in some cases not directly related to this, but were not idempotent and prevented me from making progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLonger term we will generate the examples by exporting\r\nthem into tarball as in #7472.

when computing the width of each cell in the table. This leads to improvements of ~10x on large tables (see https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/173)/\r\n\r\n<!-- ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nBenchmarked with a wide table:\r\n\r\n1. Without reusing the svg node: 4315ms\r\n2. Reusing the svg node: 2167ms\r\n3. Reusing the svg node and the textNode (this PR and https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/173): 481ms\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis is the complete fix for autocomplete in the table browser in SQL lab. We use the createFilterOptions API from the react-select-fast-filter-options library for autocomplete. The API expects a list of option objects where its properties value and label are strings. The bug is that we were passing objects to the property value, which caused the algorithm to not work properly. Now we explicitly pass strings to the API.\r\n\r\nTwo additional changes I added:\r\n\r\n1. So this entire component is buggy and doesn't work as expected. We have one function that will add the option if it is missing to the list with just the table name. I believe the original intent was to display something while we were fetching the tables. This led to a few bugs:\r\n\r\n- We may be adding a table that no longer exists to the list, which doesn't make sense. So when the user selects this table, it just breaks silently because the table doesn't exist.\r\n- Even if the table exists, we did not populate this option with the schema and so when we make a request to get the table, again it breaks silently because we get the table with just its name and no schema information.\r\n\r\nI feel that if we really wanted to display something while we fetch the tables, we should do it properly with tests. So I just removed the buggy code for now and thought we can revisit it later if that is a feature we really want.\r\n\r\n2. I had to update the unit tests to return promises because if you do not return a promise, Jest just calls the promise and continues onto the next test. This caused false positives. There were two tests that are broken and need to be fixed. I filed https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/7768 to track this so that this PR did not contain unrelated changes.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nManually and extended unit tests\r\n\r\n###

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [x] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThough for Python we currently use `flake8` and `pylint` for linting and error checking these don't auto-format the code and thus it's still relatively hard to try to enforce a common code style/format. \r\n\r\nThere seems to be three main auto-formatters: \r\n\r\n- [autopep8](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8)\r\n- [YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf)\r\n- [Black](https://github.com/python/black)\r\n\r\n[Here's](https://medium.com/3yourmind/auto-formatters-for-python-8925065f9505) a fairly good comparison of the three tools. Note that YAPF supports a number of styles including \"pep8\" (which is what autopep8 uses). The \"Facebook\" style is similar to Black. \r\n\r\nThough I don't necessarily agree with all of Black's style formatting (including the 88 character line length, non-trailing commas, double-quotes, etc.) it seems this has gained popularity(it currently has over 11,000 GitHub stars) over the likes of YAPF mostly because it _isn't_ configurable (and thus ensures consistency) which is a plus if the goal is to align on a style/format across numerous repos. \r\n\r\nThis PR performs the following:\r\n\r\n1. Formats all the code using the Black format. \r\n2. Adds a pre-commit hook to auto-format the diff using the Black format on every local commit. \r\n3. Adds a CI check to ensure that the code is Black format compliant. \r\n\r\nNote the` flake8` and `pylint` CI remains as `flake8` includes checks for import ordering as well as type checking. `pylint` additionally checks for numerous errors. In the future there would be merit in further cleaning up the code and reducing the number of `flake8` codes we ignore. \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

CATEGORY\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis bug is slightly related to #7729 , where Oracle is forced to wrap an additional query around the original query. This causes the SQLAlchemy compiler to create a new column object based on the original `TimestampExpression`, which doesn't receive a column (is only supposed to have the label of the original object), and hence is unable to complete the compilation. This is solved by passing a `ColumnClause` class to the method via the `_constructor` property that creates the outer query proxy column, which solves the problem.\r\n\r\n###

due incompabitility between `DataFrame.to_sql()` and BigQuery. However, Pandas supports uploading to BigQuery by calling the `DataFrame.to_gbq()` method, which requires the presence of `pandas_gbq`. This PR does slight modification of existing DataFrame and CSV handling methods in `db_engine_specs`, adding the possibility to easily implement custom CSV/DataFrame uploading logic for other engines, too.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n<img width=\"1175\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-06-22 at 13 05 40\"

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nFor the past few months, we were seeing errors like this during times of heavy load for superset:\r\n```\r\nsqlalchemy.exc:TimeoutError: QueuePool limit of size 30 overflow 15 reached,\r\nconnection timed out, timeout 30 (Background on this error at: http://sqlalche.me/e/3o7r)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen digging further, the stack trace revealed that these errors occurred while evaluating the `has_access` and `has_access_api` decorators. These decorators (which were added to every view in https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6553) make many selects against superset's database resulting in an extra hundred or so db reads on every request (see issue filed here https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/issues/1039).\r\n\r\nThe biggest contributor to these reads is the `/queries` API because it's polled every 2 seconds when a user has a query pending/running in SQL Lab. However, this API should be accessable to all logged in users as it simply returns the set of all queries the user owns. Therefore, I've introduced the new `logged_in_api` decorator to more efficiently secure this view.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nGist of SQL logs for `/queries` endpoint before and after this PR: https://gist.github.com/etr2460/96c9ead2fda43aff507602519cc3183e\r\n\r\nChart of queries against the superset database

TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n- Run all unit tests to ensure the view is still secured.\r\n- Ensure you can hit the queries endpoint from SQL lab when logged in, but curling it without the cookie returns a 401\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@john-bodley @mistercrunch @michellethomas @dpgaspar

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [X] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nIn SQL Lab, when you click the reload icon to force refresh the table list, it doesn't.\r\n\r\nClicking the button calls:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nchangeSchema({ value: this.props.schema }, true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that `changeSchema` does not take the second argument. I fixed it by modifying the signature, and forwarding the argument to `fetchTables` (which takes an argument for force refresh).\r\n\r\n<!-- ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nIf you click the icon to \"Force refresh the table list\", a request similar to this will be issued:\r\n\r\n`http://localhost:8081/superset/tables/1/superset/undefined/false/`\r\n\r\nNote the last path part, `false`, which maps to `force_refresh`.\r\n\r\nWith this fix:\r\n\r\n`http://localhost:8081/superset/tables/1/VIZ187/undefined/true/`\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n\r\n@khtruong @mistercrunch

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThe autocomplete in the table browser in SQL lab does not work. We use the createFilterOptions API from the react-select-fast-filter-options library for autocomplete. The API expects a list of option objects where its properties **value** and **label** are strings. The bug is that we were passing objects to the property **value**, which caused the algorithm to not work properly. Now we explicitly pass strings to the API.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nManually verified\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@betodealmeida @DiggidyDave @xtinec

Assuming ~50 thumbs are displayed on a card list view, how does the metadata database react? It can represent a fair amount of database lookups depending on the way that perms are setup (if the user is Gamma, and there are lots of dashboards on the system). We should make sure that the worst case is ok.\r\n- Caching for thumbs can be lax (doesn't have to be done daily for instance), but it's different for the image service (say for Slack or email scheduled delivery). Caching for thumb is currently forced on save events (async, and that's the way we'd tell users to get a new fresh thumb), or we could add a feature to force on the endpoint. There's also the CLI. For caching for other purposes, I think that the caching policy for charts should apply for the image the same way as it does for the JSON caching (same logic/policy).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-17T05:37:35Z","updated_at":"2020-05-22T17:33:07Z","closed_at":"2020-05-22T17:33:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c29059ee54c2a157f54a20e96fbe58e40d2e9529","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":238899554,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzg4OTk1NTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/inactive","name":"inactive","color":"14351C","default":false,"description":"Inactive

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nPer [SIP-15A](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/7656) this PR helps to ensure that  the when specifying a string like temporal column the date/timestamp `strftime` format adheres to the ISO 8601 format. The TL;DR is if we're going to filter (and thus order) dates we need to use a representation where the lexicographical order coincides with the chronological order (see the ISO 8601 section in the SIP for details). \r\n\r\nThis PR updates the CRUD and inline datasource editor (and adds validation where appropriate). Regrettable it seems in FAB we can't couple multiple fields, i.e., if the \"Is temporal\" field is unchecked then disable the \"Datetime Format\" field (@dpgaspar may know of how to do this). Additionally the messaging seems to be omitted if the form field is invalid (I was able to make this work for the default \"Detail\" tab (per [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5449)) but not for the \"Columns\" tab. \r\n\r\nI originally when down the rabbit hole of replacing the `strftime` formatting to using the more restrictive ISO 8601 constructs, i.e., `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.SSSSSS` including providing a migration. I finally opted against this as the `datetime` object doesn't support formatting using the ISO 8601 tokens (packages like `arrow` and `pendulumn` do however) and it seems like we heavily depend of the `strftime` format for transforming Pandas dataframe.\r\n\r\nNote in the future I think there may be merit in trying to migrate to using the ISO 8601 tokens as this seems more standard and a time format which a number of engines support. \r\n\r\nFinally there is no migration or corrective actions for currently ill-defined formats. This PR simply ensures that new formats are correct moving forward.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1138\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-16 at 9 22 16 AM\"

If user apply filter in 1 tab, all the charts in another tab (not visible right now) should delay query update until user click to see the tab.\r\n\r\nI found there is a bug for nested tab case: when chart in the nested tab, update filter (in another tab) will trigger new query right away. Please see before/after gif. Also updated integration test to cover this case.\r\n\r\nNote: charts outside nested tab behaves good, and is covered in the existed unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [X] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWith https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7625 SQL Lab now displays complex column types as extended columns. This might result in very wide tables that degrade performance when visualizing preview samples or query results.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies SQL Lab so that wide tables (greater than 50 columns) are displayed using `react-virtualized`'s `Grid` instead of a `Table`. This ensures that columns are loaded dynamically as the user scrolls horizontally. The only downside is that the user is no longer able to sort the data by clicking on a column header.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nHere's a demo showing the `Grid` component with the `query` table (the table has only 27 columns, but I modified the threshold temporarily in order to test):\r\n\r\n![grid-view](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/59305062-50a77400-8c4e-11e9-87bc-7c484aa93eac.gif)\r\n\r\nI also tested with a table with over 300 columns, but I can't share the data.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nTested locally (see above). Added unit test.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [X] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\nThis removes the ability of sorting on the client side on tables with more than 50 columns.\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n\r\n@mistercrunch @khtruong

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhen rendering the FilterableTable component we were rendering and measuring the width of every cell to determine the width of each column. For tables with many columns or columns with large amounts of content, this would hang the page for seconds at a time:\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-06-11 at 9 55 09 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7409244/59292004-f0eea000-8c30-11e9-8f6a-2e594ebc9da1.png)\r\n\r\nThis fix changes the font for the FilterableTable to monospaced so that we can calculate the max width of a column without rendering the each cell. This resulted in a 665x improvement in perf for the function (>3 s down to 4.8 ms in some nasty edge cases)\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-06-11 at 9 53 39 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7409244/59292156-50e54680-8c31-11e9-87a0-23c95d3b62c7.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n![slow query](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7409244/59292166-58a4eb00-8c31-11e9-8420-8fbf175a2ddd.gif)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![faster query](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7409244/59292176-5c387200-8c31-11e9-981e-f679837a1329.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nEnsure the column widths still fit all the content.

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis is very much a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) but I though there was merit in sharing early my thoughts as to how I would implement aspects of [SIP-15A](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/7656) in relation to how we could think about type conversions in the future. \r\n\r\nThe premise is Superset needs to transform either Python types (such as `datetime`) or either a SQL type (`DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`, etc.), Python type (`str`, `int`, `float`, etc.), or time grain (`P1D`, `P1W` etc). Rather than depending on methods like `convert_dttm`, `epoch_to_dttm`, etc. I felt it would make more sense to define an engine specific graph where the nodes are the various temporal types and the edges represents the SQL expression required to convert between the types. A shortest path algorithm is used to define the path (and thus SQL) between the types.\r\n\r\nI though the merits are:\r\n- Helps to ensure all the mappings reside in the same place. Note it's still somewhat fragmented due the constraints on the existing API. \r\n- Removes redundancy, i.e., in Hive there's a bug in the `from_unixtime` UDF which actually requires that the unix time be a float rather than an integer and thus one would define two edges with minimal SQL, i.e.,\r\n\r\n```\r\ngraph = nx.DiGraph()\r\ngraph.add_edge(BigInteger, Float, sql='CAST({col} AS DOUBLE)')\r\ngraph.add_edge(Float, TIMESTAMP, sql='CAST({col} AS TIMESTAMP)')\r\n```\r\n    \r\nwhich would provide these mappings; (`BigInteger`, `TIMESTAMP`) and (`Float`, `TIMESTAMP`).\r\n\r\nNote this PR does not address several aspects of SIP-15A including type inferencing and enforcing ISO 8601 encoding. Additionally if rolled out there would be additional major refactoring of the`BaseEngineSpec` and `TableColumn` classes.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7218#issuecomment-499250400 including a `BIGINT` column type as a time column in Presto is problematic as it could represent either a Unix time in seconds or milliseconds. \r\n\r\nThe current correct way to handle Unix time columns is to set the `python_date_format` as either `epoch` or `epoch_ms` (depending on the encoding) which results in queries comprising the correct fidelity: \r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS \"count\"\r\nFROM \"superset\".\"logs\"\r\nWHERE \"dttm\" >= 1553644800\r\n  AND \"dttm\" <= 1554249600\r\nORDER BY \"count\" DESC\r\nLIMIT 10000;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/7656 plans to auto-detect the encoding of temporal columns.\r\n\r\nto: @betodealmeida
