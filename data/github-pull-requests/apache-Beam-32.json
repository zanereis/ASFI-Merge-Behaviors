the segement reader so we're actually fetching more rows when the buffer size is low.\r\n\r\n`future` in segment reader is only reset to null in `waitReadRowsFuture()` method. This means that on the 2nd page of the read, we set the future to `fetchNextSegment();` (line 343), but we never checks if the future is resolved until the buffer is empty (line 345). Adding the check on line 334 will make sure we move the results to the buffer and reset future to null. So next time when the buffer size is small we send the request for the next page. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

try at this, I've added all the benchmark code and selected the top performing encoding loop (the unrolled loop) on a variety of platforms. The test produces a distribution of integers that favors small and negative integers, of which small integers more so, since a big use case for this is to encode e.g. length of an array, string, or bit set. The Blackhole tests write to an OutputStream adapter for a Blackhole object, so the compiler does not optimize away the lack of use of the output. The ByteString tests use the existing ByteStringOutputStream to reflect the consequences for real uses of this.\r\nAll tests were executed with a JDK 21 release.\r\n\r\n### x86-64 (Intel

introduced changes to allow the usage of the multimap_keys_values_side_input state key. Since some runners don't support this key yet, usage was wrapped in a try/except block so that when talking to the runner if an error state response was received then it would no-op. In practice, some runners close the data channel on unknown state keys, so this introduced a regression. This attempts to minimally fix the problem by reverting part of #29587\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

change should improve varint encoding throughput by 1.5-6x for multi-byte encodings according to benchmark tests on an Apple M1 Pro machine.\r\nThe single byte case is handled by directly writing to the stream, which can't be sped up.\r\nAll multi byte cases seem to benefit from using an intermediate buffer and writing the entire buffer to the stream.\r\nWhen the order of the mask is inversed (i.e. 1-5 writes to array, 5-10 writes to stream) the throughput metrics return to their old state, so this does not seem to be a case of branch prediction playing tricks.\r\n\r\nThe buffer length is approximated, which improved throughput on size calculation by 1.1x and overall encoding throughput by 1.3x. I am aware that the bit shift loop in getLength is typically faster than constant time tricks (it was hard to beat), but this approximation avoids a divide by 7 which typically causes that to be slower.\r\n\r\nI've benchmarked this using JMH with 3 warmups, 5 iterations, and 1 fork on an Apple M1 Pro machine (happy to provide results from other platforms).\r\nThe benchmark constructs 2048 random longs and adds bits to produce an even distribution of small and large integers.\r\n- \"All\" encodes as is to a pre-constructed ByteArrayOutputStream\r\n- \"ExtraLarge\" marks a bit to force only 10 bytes of output before encoding\r\n- \"Large\" marks a bit to force only 4 bytes of output before encoding\r\n- \"Medium\" marks a bit to force only 2 bytes of output before encoding\r\n- \"Small\" marks a bit to force only 1 byte of output before encoding\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                      Mode  Cnt       Score       Error  Units\r\nVarIntBenchmark.benchmarkNewVarIntAll         thrpt    5  320828.193 ± 20567.050  ops/s\r\nVarIntBenchmark.benchmarkNewVarIntExtraLarge  thrpt    5  243184.470 ± 31068.177  ops/s\r\nVarIntBenchmark.benchmarkNewVarIntLarge       thrpt    5  373675.092 ±  6412.076  ops/s\r\nVarIntBenchmark.benchmarkNewVarIntMedium      thrpt    5  338347.826 ± 18859.258  ops/s\r\nVarIntBenchmark.benchmarkNewVarIntSmall       thrpt    5  415559.304 ±  8169.027  ops/s\r\nVarIntBenchmark.benchmarkOldVarIntAll         thrpt    5  191424.762 ±  3954.473  ops/s\r\nVarIntBenchmark.benchmarkOldVarIntExtraLarge  thrpt    5   41411.167 ±  1322.300  ops/s\r\nVarIntBenchmark.benchmarkOldVarIntLarge       thrpt    5  102820.015 ±  5414.503  ops/s\r\nVarIntBenchmark.benchmarkOldVarIntMedium      thrpt    5  204669.983 ± 24894.096  ops/s\r\nVarIntBenchmark.benchmarkOldVarIntSmall       thrpt    5  415046.963 ±  9567.074  ops/s\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

href=\"https://github.com/actions/labeler/releases\">actions/labeler's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.0.0</h2>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<p>This release contains the following breaking changes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The ability to apply labels based on the names of base and/or head branches was added (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/actions/labeler/issues/186\">#186</a> and <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/actions/labeler/issues/54\">#54</a>). The match object for changed files was expanded with new combinations in order to make it more intuitive and flexible (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/actions/labeler/issues/423\">#423</a> and <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/actions/labeler/issues/101\">#101</a>). As a result, the configuration file structure was significantly redesigned and is not compatible with the structure of the previous version. Please read the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/labeler/tree/main#pull-request-labeler\">action documentation</a> to find out how to adapt your configuration files for use with the new action version.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The bug related to the <code>sync-labels</code> input was fixed (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/actions/labeler/issues/112\">#112</a>). Now the input value is read correctly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>By default, <code>dot</code> input is set to <code>true</code>.

This plugin is now built to Java 11 class file format. It requires Gradle to run on Java 11 or later. (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/1c1955efc33a80498d5c8f31937bd8f6a090a5a9\">1c1955e</a>)\nb. Enable Java Tool Chain support by default (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/c94b8865d844064f4900d156192c0ea448277854\">c94b886</a>). To disable it, set <code>useJavaToolchains = false</code> in the <code>spotbugs</code> extension.\nc. Drop support for Gradle 7.0 (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/4b0f8006fdfe6345a74edb356e3c3b1da13225f1\">4b0f800</a>). The convention API provides replacement from 7.1 and later, so we use 7.1 as minimal required version.\nd. Remove deprecated methods <code>SpotBugsTask.getEnabledReports()</code> and <code>SpotBugsTask.getFirstEnabledReport</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/2ab3c45bf6215ba1f35e87427893d4c97a7190bc\">2ab3c45</a>)\ne. The <code>effort</code> and <code>reportLevel</code> properties of <code>SpotBugsTask</code> and <code>SpotBugsExtension</code> now accept enum values instead of String instances. Read the following notes for detail.</p>\n<h3>Note for Groovy buildscripts</h3>\n<p>Groovy buildscripts should use use <code>valueOf(String)</code> method explicitly for <code>effort</code> and <code>reportLevel</code> properties of <code>SpotBugsTask</code> and <code>SpotBugsExtension</code>. For example:</p>\n<pre lang=\"groovy\"><code>// before (v5)\nspotbugs {\n    effort = 'default'\n    reportLevel = 'default'\n}\n<p>// after (v6)\nspotbugs {\neffort = Effort.valueOf('DEFAULT')\nreportLevel = Confidence.valueOf('DEFAULT')\n}\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>This limitation is caused by a <a href=\"https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/bug-cannot-use-kotlin-enum-from-groovy/1521\">known issue of the Groovy language</a>.</p>\n<h3>Note for Kotlin buildscripts</h3>\n<p>It is recommended to use Gradle 8.2 or later, then you can enjoy the <a href=\"https://docs.gradle.org/8.2/release-notes.html#simple-property-assignment-in-kotlin-dsl-enabled-by-default\">simple property assignment</a> feature by default.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Go SDK wasn't always sending an is_last messages WRT a datachannel's set of timers, leading to runners hanging waiting for that termination signal.\r\n\r\nAvoid unnecessary lock contention by deduplicating and creating timers in a dedicated critical section with the datachannel mutex. This adds a single locked section for creating all timers for a given bundle, instead of making them twice vs the naive approach.\r\n\r\nFixes #29605.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredit to @acrites for debugging the runner side for this issue, or I wouldn't have spotted the error.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

This plugin is now built to Java 11 class file format. It requires Gradle to run on Java 11 or later. (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/1c1955efc33a80498d5c8f31937bd8f6a090a5a9\">1c1955e</a>)\nb. Enable Java Tool Chain support by default (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/c94b8865d844064f4900d156192c0ea448277854\">c94b886</a>). To disable it, set <code>useJavaToolchains = false</code> in the <code>spotbugs</code> extension.\nc. Drop support for Gradle 7.0 (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/4b0f8006fdfe6345a74edb356e3c3b1da13225f1\">4b0f800</a>). The convention API provides replacement from 7.1 and later, so we use 7.1 as minimal required version.\nd. Remove deprecated methods <code>SpotBugsTask.getEnabledReports()</code> and <code>SpotBugsTask.getFirstEnabledReport</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/2ab3c45bf6215ba1f35e87427893d4c97a7190bc\">2ab3c45</a>)\ne. The <code>effort</code> and <code>reportLevel</code> properties of <code>SpotBugsTask</code> and <code>SpotBugsExtension</code> now accept enum values instead of String instances. Read the following notes for detail.</p>\n<h3>Note for Groovy buildscripts</h3>\n<p>Groovy buildscripts should use use <code>valueOf(String)</code> method explicitly for <code>effort</code> and <code>reportLevel</code> properties of <code>SpotBugsTask</code> and <code>SpotBugsExtension</code>. For example:</p>\n<pre lang=\"groovy\"><code>// before (v5)\nspotbugs {\n    effort = 'default'\n    reportLevel = 'default'\n}\n<p>// after (v6)\nspotbugs {\neffort = Effort.valueOf('DEFAULT')\nreportLevel = Confidence.valueOf('DEFAULT')\n}\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>This limitation is caused by a <a href=\"https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/bug-cannot-use-kotlin-enum-from-groovy/1521\">known issue of the Groovy language</a>.</p>\n<h3>Note for Kotlin buildscripts</h3>\n<p>It is recommended to use Gradle 8.2 or later, then you can enjoy the <a href=\"https://docs.gradle.org/8.2/release-notes.html#simple-property-assignment-in-kotlin-dsl-enabled-by-default\">simple property assignment</a> feature by default.</p>\n<pre lang=\"kotlin\"><code>// legacy (Gradle 8.1 and older)\nimport com.github.spotbugs.snom.Confidence\nimport com.github.spotbugs.snom.Effort\n<p>spotbugs {\neffort.set(Effort.DEFAULT)\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

onto inside of the sampler until the work item has been committed (at which point the in-memory map is cleared for that work item).\r\n- adds a message to the windmill API proto for sending dofn latency info back to windmill\r\n    - On the heartbeats: sends the DoFn name that the currently active message is in and how long it has been there for\r\n    - On commits: sends the mean, min, max,

ability to perform point lookups for multi-map side inputs is great for maps that are too large to fit into memory, but can be very inefficient in requiring an entire state request per key for small maps.\r\n\r\nThis change adds an optional protocol to request an entire map as a stream of key-values in one (possibly paginated) API call, and uses this to bulk pre-fetch an initial set of values from the map before falling back to point lookups.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
