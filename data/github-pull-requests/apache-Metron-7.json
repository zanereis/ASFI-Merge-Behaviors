Contributor Comments\r\nThis is a Vagrant config change to enable the use of vagrant-cachier to reduce build times for the full dev platform. Time saving is heavily network dependent, but anecdotally I've found it saves me around 10 mins per provision of vagrant development environment. YMMV.\r\n\r\nTo test:\r\n\r\n1. Install vagrant-cachier, and spin up centos and ubuntu vagrant development platforms.\r\n2. Verify that packages are populated into your local (the client running vagrant) ~/.vagrant/cache directories.\r\n3. vagrant destroy your development environments\r\n4. spin up vagrant environments again, packages should be pulled from the cache instead of the network at this point.\r\n\r\nNote that the vagrant-cachier plugin is not required, nor shipped, bundled or in any way distributed by this change. It does have a compatible license (MIT) but it is outside of the Metron project scope to install this, so there is no need to update license or dependency documentation.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis is a Vagrant config change to enable the use of vagrant-cachier to reduce build times for the full dev platform. Time saving is heavily network dependent, but anecdotally I've found it saves me around 10 mins per provision of vagrant development environment. YMMV.\r\n\r\nTo test:\r\n\r\n1. Install vagrant-cachier, and spin up centos and ubuntu vagrant development platforms.\r\n2. Verify that packages are populated into your local (the client running vagrant) ~/.vagrant/cache directories.\r\n3. vagrant destroy your development environments\r\n4. spin up vagrant environments again, packages should be pulled from the cache instead of the network at this point.\r\n\r\nNote that the vagrant-cachier plugin is not required, nor shipped, bundled or in any way distributed by this change. It does have a compatible license (MIT) but it is outside of the Metron project scope to install this, so there is no need to update license or dependency documentation.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Problem\r\n\r\nThe integration tests were failing intermittently when Storm unexpectedly expired messages generated by the integration tests.  When Storm expired these messages they were never received by the Profiler bolts, which caused the integration tests to fail.\r\n\r\n### Root Cause\r\n\r\nStorm's event window mechanism was not configured correctly to use the timestamp extracted from the telemetry message.  Storm was instead defaulting to system time.  \r\n\r\nIf the time when the downstream `ProfileBuilderBolt` processed a message differed significantly enough from when the upstream `ProfileSplitterBolt` processed the message, the message would be errantly expired by Storm.  \r\n\r\nThis is why the problem could only be replicated when run in Travis, a resource constrained environment.  When run on any other environment, the system time when these two events occur will not differ enough for Storm to mistakenly expire the test messages.\r\n\r\nThis bug shows itself when you have significantly out-of-order messages and when flushing expired profiles, which is what the integration tests rely on.\r\n\r\n### The Fix\r\n\r\nThe simple fix was to ensure that Storm uses the correct event timestamp field.  Doing this highlighted another problem.  Storm does not work correctly when using tick tuples along with an event timestamp field.  Storm will attempt to extract an event timestamp from the tick tuple, which will not exist and cause the entire topology to fail.\r\n\r\nThis meant that I could not use tick tuples.  To work around this, I created a separate thread that flushes the expired profiles regularly.  The separate thread introduces thread safety concerns, so I also needed to perform some locking.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nMost of these changes were done in separate commits to making review easier.\r\n\r\n1. Added a separate thread to the `ProfileBuilderBolt` to flush expired profiles regularly.  This is the core fix to the integration test bug.\r\n\r\n2. Corrected the key generated to cache `ProfileBuilder` objects.  This previously relied on the underlying `ProfileConfig.toString` method which was error prone and slow.  It now uses the hash key.\r\n\r\n3. Reduced the number of Profiler integration tests.  There is now one integration test that tests event time processing and another that tests the same profile using processing time.\r\n\r\n    Previously there were a number of different profiles that were tested.  This was necessary before as the integration tests were the only effective way to test different profile logic.  Since then, significant refactoring has occurred which allowed the same logic to be tested in unit tests rather than in integration tests.  \r\n\r\n    This allowed me to clean-up these tests which reduces run time and complexity in the integration tests.\r\n\r\n4. Added some simple debug logging to `HBaseBolt`.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nCurrently if one tries to enrich an missing value (e.g. via a hbase enrichment) with the new enrichment topology, you get NPEs.  The existing semantics from the old enrichment topology is for no enrichment to happen.  The new enrichment topology should be made to match this semantic.\r\n\r\nTo test this, create a hbase enrichment of a field that does not exist and send data through it for a dummy sensor.\r\nFor instance, in `$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/enrichments/dummy.json` configure it thusly\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\t\"enrichment\": {\r\n\t\t\"fieldMap\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"hbaseEnrichment\": [\r\n\t\t\t\t\"not_there\"\r\n\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\t\"fieldToTypeMap\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"not_there\": [\r\n\t\t\t\t\"playful_classification\"\r\n\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t},\r\n\t\"threatIntel\": {\r\n\t\t\"fieldMap\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"hbaseThreatIntel\": [\r\n\t\t\t\t\"not_there\"\r\n\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\t\"fieldToTypeMap\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"not_there\": [\r\n\t\t\t\t\"malicious_ip\"\r\n\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\t\"triageConfig\": {}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nSolr throws an error when an index included in a query doesn't exist where Elasticsearch simply ignores that error.  This PR makes the Solr implementation equivalent to the Elasticsearch implementation by removing an indices that don't exist from the query before it is executed.\r\n\r\nThis has been tested on full dev.  After spinning it up and switching the Indexing search engine to Solr, alerts should appear in the Alerts UI.  I also slightly modified a test case to catch this in the future.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nThere's a few changes that had to happen\r\n* General version upgrades (e.g. maven-site-plugin and maven-fluido-skin had to upgrade as well).\r\n* Couple migration changes (e.g. the CDATA portion of the site.xml.template) was necessary.\r\n* Good amount of markdown cleanup which broke code blocks.  The newer parsing version really doesn't like when you aren't indented correctly and fails in a more visually displeasing way, unfortunately.\r\n* Some markdown cleanup to fix some visual indenting that didn't break code blocks.\r\n\r\nAt this point, the site should be created and the pages all formatted without issues.  The issue you'd see from spacing is a just an empty code block, possibly trailed by a portion of the part in backticks, so watch out for that.

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds a way for integration tests to lookup the docker machine ip address if there is one.  Due to networking limitations in Mac OSX, Docker requires containers be run in a virtual machine (or docker machine).  This means that services must be addressed through the virtual machine ip address rather than just localhost.  This utility allows integration tests to run in either a typical Docker deployment or when debugging locally in Mac OSX.  An example of how it's used is included in the metron-elasticsearch integration tests.\r\n\r\nA docker-machine ip address is returned if the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n- docker-machine is installed locally\r\n- a machine called metron-machine exists\r\n- a proper ip address is found for that machine\r\n\r\nOtherwise (as in the case of travis) localhost is returned.  A method for looking up the correct port for a service is also included in case any ports need to be mapped to different ports within a docker machine.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nCurrently we have two concepts of dealing with messages that are not going to be passed through:\r\n\r\n* Messages that fail global validation\r\n* Messages that fail the parser's validation function\r\n* Messages that are filtered out\r\nCurrently \r\n* in the case of messages that fail global validation, we send them to the error queue.\r\n* in the case of messages that fail the parser's validation function, we drop them silently.\r\n* in the case of messages that are filtered out, we drop them silently as well.\r\n\r\nGiven the use-cases behind filtering (e.g. a kafka topic with multiple types of messages where we want to pass along only one type), it makes sense to drop them silently.  However, in the case of the messages that fail the parser's validation function, we should like to know that and treat those similarly to those messages that fail global validation.\r\n\r\nIn order to test this, create a grok parser without a timestamp configured (this will make it fail the grok parser's validation) and pass along a message.  Ensure that it makes it to the error queue rather than being dropped silently.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nInitial pass of adding meta alert functionality to the Solr implementation.  It's extremely similar in style to the ES implementation (metaalerts field on an individual alert that list the metaalerts it belongs to, alerts field on metaalerts that has a denormalized copy of the individual alerts).\r\n\r\nI need to do whatever running up we're set up for on this branch at this point.  I got the build running and all the tests working.  Sidenote, if anyone can tell me what exactly should be run up at this point, I would appreciate it.\r\n\r\nMain things that are in this PR:\r\n\r\n- `SolrMetaAlertDao` and integration tests.\r\n- Schema changes as appropriate to support meta alerts.\r\n- Lot of refactoring to have the ES and Solr implementations share a lot of metaalert code, seen in `AbstractMetaAlertDao`\r\n- Lot of refactoring to have the ES and Solr integration tests share a lot of common code, seen in `MetaAlertIntegrationTest`\r\n- There are some minor behavior differences, e.g. a metaalert with no alerts might return either no field or an empty list depending on Solr vs. ES.  These (should) be limited to things we should be handling robustly elsewhere anyway.\r\n- Some minor bugfixes (e.g. some leftover hardcoding, added some retry based result lookups, and so on).\r\n- The index config needs to be available to Solr, so that we can determine what collection a given sensor belongs to.\r\n- The `SolrComponent` can now have collections added while running, and tear them down between tests.\r\n\r\nThings to look out for during review\r\n- The use of a lot of the constants can be tricky to track, care should be given to make sure the appropriate choices are made (e.g. for some of the typing and such).\r\n- The correctness of Solr queries.  They're finicky, so make sure they make sense.\r\n- Any stray` System.out`s.\r\n- Stuff tends to be deferred to the implementations in certain cases.  If there are cleaner ways to handle some of that, let me know.\r\n- Any refactorings that could happen to merge anything else between impls.\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous Notes\r\n- Child documents in Solr do not get a field name.  This implementation chooses to treat any child as a the child alert, and pass it back up the stack as the alert field to match ES.  Similarly, going down the stack, Documents will have their alert field translated to the Solr field.\r\n- Deleting all children of a parent in Solr seems to not work.  I've seen references that this operation is undefined online, but hadn't seen it in the docs (although adding/removing in general is. It's weird).  Instead, if all children would be gone, they are manually deleted before the parent update is set.  If anyone knows better, I'd be thrilled.\r\n- There's a bit of minor cleanup through some of the files that got touched. The test schema files in particular got autoformatted, because it was a pain to deal with sometimes when things were at different indentations and such.\r\n- We're still apparently using ':' for all of our field names (e.g. source:type). Is there a particular reason other than inertia?  Seems like we could be using '.' and my life would be easier here.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

enables the use of event time processing in the Profiler.\r\n\r\nBy default, the Profiler will still use processing time.  If you configure the profiler with a `timestampField` then it will extract the timestamps from that field contained within the incoming telemetry.  \r\n\r\nReview the updates that have made to the Profiler README for more details on how this works and how it should be configured.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* The core Profiler classes in `metron-profiler-common` were refactored slightly so that time is always injected from the outside.  When run in Storm, the Storm bolts are responsible for keeping track of time.  When run in the REPL, the `StandAloneProfiler` is responsible for keeping track of time.\r\n\r\n* A `Clock` abstraction was created (er enhanced?) to handle the differences between processing time and event time.  If operating in processing time, the `WallClock` implementation will be used.  If operating in event time, the `EventTimeClock` will be used.  Given a message, a `Clock` will always tell us what time it is.\r\n\r\n* A `ClockFactory` will give us the right `Clock` based on what the Profiler configuration looks-like. This factory is used in both the Storm and REPL interfaces.\r\n\r\n* The `ProfileSplitterBolt` takes a message, uses a `Clock` to get a timestamp, then sends the message and the correct timestamp to the downstream `ProfileBuilderBolt`s.  The `ProfileBuilderBolt` trusts the timestamp that it was given and continues on its merry way.\r\n\r\n* The `ProfilerBuilderBolt` uses a `FlushSignal` to know when to flush.  There is some important subtlety contained in this logic.  If you accidentally inject a message with a recent timestamp when you are running with older, archived data, it will prevent the system from flushing when you expect it to.  This is because the new message advances time to the most recent timestamp.  I might of run into this when testing. :)  I added an important check and log statement to help make this very noticeable.\r\n\r\n* There was one difference between processing and event time that had to be accounted for.  When in processing time, if a profile stops receiving messages that profile still needs to flush at the end of the period.  When in event time this is not the case.  In event time, if you stop receiving messages, time effectively does not advance. This was accounted for by creating the concept of \"expired\" profiles in the `MessageDistributor`.  The `ProfileBuilderBolt`s then use a tick tuple to periodically flush expired profiles.  See the javadoc for more explanation.\r\n\r\n* Additional properties were added to adjust the event time processing logic that we leverage in Storm.  This includes specifying a window length and a window lag.  There will be 1 or more windows in each profile period.  A smaller window lets the profiler process a smaller chunk of messages at a time.  The window lag allows you to adjust the Profiler depending on how out-of-order your incoming telemetry is.\r\n\r\n* The Mpack was updated to support the additional properties.\r\n\r\n* I added a lot of useful logging to help troubleshoot and debug issues when running in Storm.  If you go into the Storm UI and turn on DEBUG level logging for `org.apache.metron.profiler`, you will get some useful information in the worker logs.\r\n\r\n### Manual Testing\r\n\r\nThis change can be tested manually when the Profiler is running atop Storm or when run in the REPL.\r\n\r\n#### Testing in the REPL\r\n\r\n1. Create a simple profile and define a \"timestampField\" in the Profiler configuration.  This will tell the Profiler to operate using event time.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT(conf)\r\n    {\r\n    \t\"profiles\" : [\r\n    \t\t{\r\n    \t\t\"profile\": \"counter\",\r\n    \t\t\"foreach\": \"'counter'\",\r\n    \t\t\"init\": { \"counter\": 0 },\r\n    \t\t\"update\": { \"counter\" : \"counter + 1\" },\r\n    \t\t\"result\": \"counter\"\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t],\r\n    \t\"timestampField\" : \"timestamp\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create a message that has a timestamp.  In this example, the timestamp is really old, like 1970 old.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> msg := SHELL_EDIT()\r\n    {\r\n    \t\"timestamp\": 1\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create the Profiler.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> p := PROFILER_INIT(conf)\r\n    Profiler{1 profile(s), 0 messages(s), 0 route(s)}\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Apply the message to the Profiler.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILER_APPLY(msg, p)\r\n    Profiler{1 profile(s), 1 messages(s), 1 route(s)}\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Flush the Profiler.  Notice that the 'period' of the measurement that was produced is also from 1970, which indicates that the Profiler successfully used event time.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILER_FLUSH(p)\r\n    [{period={duration=900000, period=0, start=0, end=900000}, profile=counter, groups=[], value=1, entity=counter}]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Now let's do the same, but using processing time.  Use the same profile, but this time do not specify a 'timestampField'.  \r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT(conf)\r\n    {\r\n      \"profiles\" : [\r\n        {\r\n          \"profile\": \"counter\",\r\n          \"foreach\": \"'counter'\",\r\n          \"init\": { \"counter\": 0 },\r\n          \"update\": { \"counter\" : \"counter + 1\" },\r\n          \"result\": \"counter\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Now run through the same steps.   Notice how the period of the measurement is based on system time now.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> p := PROFILER_INIT(conf)\r\n    Profiler{1 profile(s), 0 messages(s), 0 route(s)}\r\n\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILER_APPLY(msg, p)\r\n    Profiler{1 profile(s), 1 messages(s), 1 route(s)}\r\n\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILER_FLUSH(p)\r\n    [{period={duration=900000, period=1690248, start=1521223200000, end=1521224100000}, profile=counter, groups=[], value=1, entity=counter}]\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n#### Testing in Storm\r\n\r\n1. Launch a development environment.  Shutdown Indexing, Elasticsearch, Kibana, YARN, and MapReduce2 to avoid any resource issues.\r\n\r\n1. Using Ambari, change the following settings and restart the Profiler.\r\n\r\n    Set the \"Period Duration\" to 1 minute.\r\n    Set the \"Window Duration\" to 15 seconds.\r\n    Set the \"Window Lag\" to 30 seconds.\r\n\r\n1. Replace `/opt/sensor-stubs/bin/start-bro-stub` with the following.\r\n\r\n    Instead of adding the current time into each Bro message, this will add a timestamp from 1 day ago.\r\n    ```\r\n    #\r\n    # how long to delay between each 'batch' in seconds.\r\n    #\r\n    DELAY=${1:-2}\r\n\r\n    #\r\n    # how many messages to send in each 'batch'.  the messages are drawn randomly\r\n    # from the entire set of canned data.\r\n    #\r\n    COUNT=${2:-10}\r\n\r\n    INPUT=\"/opt/sensor-stubs/data/bro.out\"\r\n    PRODUCER=\"/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh\"\r\n    TOPIC=\"bro\"\r\n\r\n    while true; do\r\n\r\n      # transform the bro timestamp and push to kafka\r\n      SEARCH=\"\\\"ts\\\"\\:[0-9]\\+\\.\"\r\n      REPLACE=\"\\\"ts\\\"\\:`date -d '1 day ago' +'%s'`\\.\"\r\n      shuf -n $COUNT $INPUT | sed -e \"s/$SEARCH/$REPLACE/g\" | $PRODUCER --broker-list node1:6667 --topic $TOPIC\r\n\r\n      sleep $DELAY\r\n    done\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Restart the Bro Sensor Stub.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    service sensor-stubs stop\r\n    service sensor-stubs start bro\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Open up the REPL and configure the Profiler like so.\r\n\r\n    Notice that we are setting the 'timestampField' within the Profiler configuration.  This will tell the Profiler to extract the timestamp from this field rather than using system time.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT(conf)\r\n    {\r\n      \"profiles\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"profile\": \"hello-world\",\r\n          \"onlyif\": \"source.type == 'bro'\",\r\n          \"foreach\": \"'global'\",\r\n          \"init\":    { \"count\": \"0\" },\r\n          \"update\":  { \"count\": \"count + 1\" },\r\n          \"result\":  \"count\"\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"timestampField\": \"timestamp\"\r\n    }\r\n    [Stellar]>>>\r\n    [Stellar]>>>\r\n    [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"PROFILER\",conf)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Query the Profiler data store.  This will take a minute or so until you see a value written.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"hello-world\", \"global\", PROFILE_FIXED(2, \"DAYS\"))\r\n    []\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"hello-world\", \"global\", PROFILE_FIXED(2, \"DAYS\"))\r\n    [200]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Now query back just a couple hours instead.  Notice that you should get no results.  This indicates that the Profiler successfully used the timestamp from the Bro data which contained day old values.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"hello-world\", \"global\", PROFILE_FIXED(2, \"HOURS\"))\r\n    []\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Now change the Profiler configuration to remove the \"timestampField\" setting.  This will switch the Profiler back to using system aka processing time.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT(conf)\r\n    {\r\n      \"profiles\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"profile\": \"hello-world\",\r\n          \"onlyif\": \"source.type == 'bro'\",\r\n          \"foreach\": \"'global'\",\r\n          \"init\":    { \"count\": \"0\" },\r\n          \"update\":  { \"count\": \"count + 1\" },\r\n          \"result\":  \"count\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n    [Stellar]>>>\r\n    [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"PROFILER\",conf)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. The Profiler will pick-up the change after the next flush event.  Query for profile data in the past few minutes.  This shows that the Profiler has switched back to use system time aka processing time.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"hello-world\", \"global\", PROFILE_FIXED(2, \"MINUTES\"))\r\n    [180, 190]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. In Storm you can also set logging to DEBUG for \"org.apache.metron.profiler\". This will output detailed worker logs that allows you to also verify that the profiler is using the correct timestamps.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nIf either topology is down, Ambari shows all of Indexing as dead. Clicking start attempts to start them both and fails if either is still running. Furthermore, it appears to retry 3 times before finally failing the command.\r\n\r\nIn order to test this, kill one of the indexing topologies then attempt to start indexing from ambari.  Things should go smoothly.  Also, try restarting and starting in various states.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nIf a user specifies an enrichment adapter name that doesn't exist (e.g. `hbaseEnrichment` vs `hbaseThreatIntel`), then we NPE rather than express the issue in the logs.\r\n\r\nTo test this, try to create an enrichment with an incorrect name.  For instance, an enrichment like so:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\t\"enrichment\": {\r\n\t\t\"fieldMap\": {},\r\n\t\t\"fieldToTypeMap\": {},\r\n\t\t\"config\": {}\r\n\t},\r\n\t\"threatIntel\": {\r\n\t\t\"fieldMap\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"hbaseEnrichment\": [\"ip_src_addr\", \"ip_dst_addr\"]\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\t\"fieldToTypeMap\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"ip_src_addr\": [\"malicious_ip\"],\r\n\t\t\t\"ip_dst_addr\": [\"malicious_ip\"]\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\t\"config\": {},\r\n\t\t\"triageConfig\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"riskLevelRules\": [],\r\n\t\t\t\"aggregator\": \"MAX\",\r\n\t\t\t\"aggregationConfig\": {}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t},\r\n\t\"configuration\": {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBecause there is no enrichment adapter named `hbaseEnrichment` available for threat intel (the correct name is `hbaseThreatIntel`), an error should be noted in the logs and there should be a sensible message, such as: `java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to find an adapter for hbaseEnrichment, possible adapters are: stellar,hbaseThreatIntel` rather than a NPE.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds Kerberos support for Solr in Metron.  This has been verified in full dev using the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev\r\n2. Stop and remove Elasticsearch and Kibana\r\n3. Install HDP Search (https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDP2/HDP-2.6.0/bk_solr-search-installation/content/ch_hdp-search-install-ambari.html)\r\n4. Create collections for bro, snort and error using the `$METRON_HOME/bin/create_collection.sh` script.\r\n5. Kerberize full dev using the instructions in https://github.com/apache/metron/blob/master/metron-deployment/Kerberos-manual-setup.md\r\n6. In Ambari, change the \"Solr Zookeeper Urls\" setting in the Metron > Index Settings tab to \"node1:2181/solr\" and the \"Random Access Search Engine\" setting in the Metron > Indexing tab to \"Solr\" (it also helps to change \"Random Access Indexing Offset\" in the Metron > Indexing tab to \"LATEST\")\r\n7. Verify data is showing up in Solr\r\n8. Restart Metron REST and you should be able to query data in Solr without issue\r\n\r\nThis PR assumes HDP Search is being used.  The benefit of using HDP Search is that Ambari handles Kerberos configuration for Solr.  If using a separate Solr install, Kerberos configuration would need to be done manually there.\r\n\r\nSide note:  I had a lot of trouble getting everything to work all at once due to resource constraints in full dev.  I would suggest shutting down as many services as possible, getting data into Solr first, then shutting down topologies, then starting REST and querying data.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nIt looks like we are going to be forced into upgrading vagrant based on some HashiCorp deprecation activities.  See:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-enterprise-saas-has-a-new-address\r\n\r\nI'm still digging around for the specific repoint change - I just upgraded to the latest and that fixed it.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if you don't have centos6 or ubuntu14 locally, you see something like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ vagrant up\r\nBringing machine 'node1' up with 'virtualbox' provider...\r\n==> node1: Box 'centos/6' could not be found. Attempting to find and install...\r\nnode1: Box Provider: virtualbox\r\nnode1: Box Version: >= 0\r\nThe box 'centos/6' could not be found or\r\ncould not be accessed in the remote catalog. If this is a private\r\nbox on HashiCorp's Atlas, please verify you're logged in via\r\n`vagrant login`. Also, please double-check the name. The expanded\r\nURL and error message are shown below:\r\n\r\nURL: [\"https://atlas.hashicorp.com/centos/6\"]\r\nError: The requested URL returned error: 404 Not Found\r\n```\r\n\r\nI poked around in their changelog and couldn't find this issue indicated anywhere.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nRemove your local centos/6 and/or ubuntu14 boxes, attempt to spin up the dev environment, upgrade vagrant, attempt again.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nIn performance evaluation, generating synthetic load and monitoring the write throughput of our kafka-to-kafka topologies has required a lot of custom scripting.  We should have a tool that could do the following:\r\n\r\n* Take a file representing a message template and generate synthetic load at a given events per second\r\n* Monitor the kafka offsets of a topic and report throughput numbers in events per second\r\n\r\nCurrently pending:\r\n* Documentation\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR updates the REST start script to properly include the correct indexing jar on the classpath depending on the configured indexing writer (Elasticsearch or Solr).  To test this:\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev and follow the instructions for manually installing Solr:  https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/feature/METRON-1416-upgrade-solr/metron-platform/metron-solr#installing. \r\n2. Change the Index Writer to \"Solr\" in Ambari (Metron > Indexing tab) and restart the Indexing component.\r\n3. Verify data is landing in the Solr collections\r\n4. Restart the REST component in Ambari\r\n5. You should be able to execute search queries in Swagger\r\n\r\nI had to include a stubbed SolrMetaAlertDao class that doesn't do anything to get everything to start up.  This will eventually be replaced by the work being done in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1421.  I also fixed a bug in the SolrDao that was causing in issue in the Alerts UI.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis updates the prepare-commit script to work with `apache/metron-bro-plugin-kafka`.\r\n\r\nTo test, run the `prepare-commit` script and specify `metron`, `bro`, or blank when it asks for which repo.  It should use metron by default, but properly accounts for the bro repo if you specify it.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nBased on the performance tuning exercise as part of METRON-1460, guava has difficulties with cache sizes over 10k.  We, unfortunately, are quite demanding of guava in this regard so we should transition a few uses of guava to Caffeine:\r\n\r\n* Stellar processor cache\r\n* The JoinBolt cache\r\n* The Enrichment Bolt Cache\r\n\r\nTest plan:\r\nFirst, spin up full-dev and ensure things continue to work.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I created a new type called `dummy`, added some stellar enrichments, stellar threat triage enrichments and a triage rule to ensure things continued to work with stellar (exercising the stellar processor cache and the enrichment bolt cache).\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR makes the Solr schema compatible with Solr 5.5.2.  The client code worked as is (compiled with version 6.6.2), no changes necessary.\r\n\r\nTo test this in full dev:\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev\r\n2. Install HDP Search (\"Chapter 3:  Installing HDP Search Using Ambari\" in https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDP2/HDP-2.6.2/bk_solr-search-installation/bk_solr-search-installation.pdf)\r\n3. Create the bro and snort collections manually:\r\n```\r\n/opt/lucidworks-hdpsearch/solr/bin/solr create -c bro -d /usr/metron/0.4.3/config/schema/bro\r\n/opt/lucidworks-hdpsearch/solr/bin/solr create -c snort -d /usr/metron/0.4.3/config/schema/snort\r\n```\r\n4. Create a file named `metron_solr_template_installed_flag_file` in $METRON_HOME/config\r\n5. Navigate to the Metron service in Ambari and change the \"Solr Zookeeper Urls\" setting in the Index Settings tab to `node1:2181/solr`\r\n6. Change the \"Random Access Search Engine\" setting in the Indexing tab to `Solr`\r\n7. Restart the Indexing component in Ambari\r\n\r\nNavigate to node1:8983 and inspect the bro and snort collections.  They should contain data.  There will likely be additional Ambari work should we decide to move to HDP Search.  This PR still assumes Solr 6.6.2 will be installed manually.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nCurrently there are some deficiencies in our grouping approach in the enrichment topology:\r\n\r\n* We have field grouping by key in places where we need LOCAL_OR_SHUFFLE groupings\r\n* We have shuffle groupings in places where we need LOCAL_OR_SHUFFLE groupings\r\n* We have field groupings by key in places where we need field grouping by message (specifically in the connections from the splitter to the enrichments).\r\n  * Field grouping by key, as we had before, ensured that we had fewer cache hits as opposed to field grouping by message.\r\n\r\nTo test this, just run things up in full-dev and ensure that data continues to flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1462\r\n\r\nThis splits ES and Kibana into their own MPacks. Two comments for reviewers:\r\n- The original discuss thread mentioned putting this in metron-contrib. Are we dead set on this, or is my split in metron-deployment reasonable?\r\n- I kept the Kibana templates and associated documentation in their current location and migrated them with the Kibana service. This is consistent with our current deployment and means we don't need to add a new set of features to the Metron MPack to publish them. A point in favor of moving this to Metron's MPack would be that we think this is in the purview of Metron and would make the Ambari design more consistent when we introduce Solr. \r\n**UPDATE** - Kibana dashboard moved to Metron MPack.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nSpin up full dev and verify the Kibana dashboard is displaying information.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? If not one needs to be created at [Metron Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel).\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with METRON-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you included steps to reproduce the behavior or problem that is being changed or addressed?\r\n- [x] Have you included steps or a guide to how the change may be verified and tested manually?\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests and checks have been executed in the root metron folder via:\r\n  ```\r\n  mvn -q clean integration-test install && dev-utilities/build-utils/verify_licenses.sh \r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you verified the basic functionality of the build by building and running locally with Vagrant full-dev environment or the equivalent?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered by building and verifying the site-book? If not then run the following commands and the verify changes via `site-book/target/site/index.html`:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  cd site-book\r\n  mvn site\r\n

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR switches metron-elasticsearch integration tests from using in-memory components to the e2e Docker infrastructure.  A high-level summary of the changes:\r\n\r\n- Updated travis to only run the metron-elasticsearch tests\r\n- Updated the Elasticsearch Docker image to the same version as Metron\r\n- Removed the requirement to build a base \"metron-centos\" image.  Removes an extra Docker build step and I'm not sure caching this helps much anyways.\r\n- Updated each integration test to use index names that are namespaced with the test class name\r\n- Replaced the in-memory component setup with an Elasticsearch client configured for the Elasticsearch Docker container\r\n- Added steps to setup/delete indices before/after each test\r\n- Moved Elasticsearch in-memory helper methods and common integration tests methods to a utils class\r\n- Fixed a minor bug in the ElasticsearchMetaAlertDao class where the index is always hardcoded to \"metaalert\"\r\n- Added some initial documentation for the metron-docker-e2e module\r\n\r\nThe scope of this PR are 3 of the 4 metron-elasticsearch integration tests:\r\n\r\n- org.apache.metron.elasticsearch.integration.ElasticsearchMetaAlertIntegrationTest\r\n- org.apache.metron.elasticsearch.integration.ElasticsearchSearchIntegrationTest\r\n- org.apache.metron.elasticsearch.integration.ElasticsearchUpdateIntegrationTest\r\n\r\nMost of the test logic in org.apache.metron.elasticsearch.integration.ElasticsearchIndexingIntegrationTest is actually in metron-indexing so that test will be updated when we convert that module.\r\n\r\nAt this point only the metron-elasticsearch tests are run in travis.  My plan is to slowly add tests for each module until we reach feature parity with master.  At that point the \"install\" section of .travis.yml will be the same.  The alerts ui e2e tests were removed for now until the work being done to stabilize them is complete.\r\n\r\nThe ES in-memory component starts up pretty fast so performance improved for the 3 tests by about 7 seconds.  Curious to hear what people think.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThere are some deficiencies to the split/join topology.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to reason about\r\n* Understanding the latency of enriching a message requires looking at multiple bolts that each give summary statistics\r\n* The join bolt's cache is really hard to reason about when performance tuning\r\n* During spikes in traffic, you can overload the join bolt's cache and drop messages if you aren't careful\r\n* In general, it's hard to associate a cache size and a duration kept in cache with throughput and latency\r\n* There are a lot of network hops per message\r\n* Right now we are stuck at 2 stages of transformations being done (enrichment and threat intel).  It's very possible that you might want stellar enrichments to depend on the output of other stellar enrichments.  In order to implement this in split/join you'd have to create a cycle in the storm topology\r\n\r\nI propose that we move to a model where we do enrichments in a single bolt in parallel using a static threadpool (e.g. multiple workers in the same process would share the threadpool).  IN all other ways, this would be backwards compatible.  A transparent drop-in for the existing enrichment topology.\r\nThere are some pros/cons about this too:\r\n* Pro\r\n  * Easier to reason about from an individual message perspective\r\n  * Architecturally decoupled from Storm\r\n  * This sets us up if we want to consider other streaming technologies\r\n  * Fewer bolts\r\n    * spout -> enrichment bolt -> threatintel bolt -> output bolt\r\n  * Way fewer network hops per message\r\ncurrently 2n+1 where n is the number of enrichments used (if using stellar subgroups, each subgroup is a hop)\r\n  * Easier to reason about from a performance perspective\r\n  * We trade cache size and eviction timeout for threadpool size\r\n  * We set ourselves up to have stellar subgroups with dependencies\r\ni.e. stellar subgroups that depend on the output of other subgroups\r\nIf we do this, we can shrink the topology to just spout -> enrichment/threat intel -> output\r\n* Con\r\n  * We can no longer tune stellar enrichments independent from HBase enrichments\r\n    * To be fair, with enrichments moving to stellar, this is the case in the split/join approach too\r\n  * No idea about performance\r\n\r\nWhat I propose is to submit a PR that will deliver an alternative, completely backwards compatible topology for enrichment that you can use by adjusting the `start_enrichment_topology.sh` script to use `remote-unified.yaml` instead of `remote.yaml`.  If we live with it for a while and have some good experiences with it, maybe we can consider retiring the old enrichment topology.\r\n\r\nTo test this, spin up vagrant and edit `$METRON_HOME/bin/start_enrichment_topology.sh` to use `remote-unified.yaml` instead of `remote.yaml`.  Restart enrichment and you should see a topology that looks something like:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/540359/36556636-e0ae092e-17d3-11e8-9e45-5160b4f23451.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nShading and relocating the jackson library had the unexpected behavior of breaking patch requests in the REST API.  The solution is that we moved the remaining patch functionality inside `JSONUtils` and stop relying on Jackson specific classes in our external API (e.g. `PatchRequest`).\r\n\r\nTo exercise this behavior, from the alerts UI, click on an message and click \"Escalate.\"  From the console ensure that the patch request returns a 200 code rather than a 400 or 500 code.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR allows support for Metron-related Solr configuration and management through Ambari.  That does NOT include managing the actual Solr service.  For now this is done outside of Ambari.\r\n\r\nHigh level changes include:\r\n\r\n- Solr is now installed automatically in full dev, although not in a running state.  This implementation was inspired by the `install_solr.sh` script.\r\n- Additional scripts for managing the Solr installation provided in full dev and installed with `install_solr.sh`.\r\n- Exposes a single Zookeeper Solr configuration (for now) parameter through Ambari.\r\n- Replaced the random access index writer class Ambari parameter with a random access search engine parameter that is a drop down of \"Elasticsearch\" and \"Solr\".  \r\n- Replaced \"Elasticsearch\" with \"Random Access\" in all the Ambari parameter descriptions.\r\n- Added the Solr schema creation to Ambari on Indexing start.  This matches the ES template loading implementation with the exception of exposing it through Service actions.\r\n\r\nTesting instructions are as follows:\r\n1. Spin up full dev\r\n2. Shutdown ES and Kibana\r\n3. Start Solr from the command line with $METRON_HOME/bin/start_solr.sh\r\n4. Navigate to the Indexing tab in Ambari > Metron > Configs and change the \"Random Access Search Engine\" setting from \"Elasticsearch\" to \"Solr\"\r\n5. Now you can start ingesting data into Solr in 2 ways.  After you make the change in Ambari it will prompt you to restart affected services.  A restart does not automatically create collections so you will need to do this outside of Ambari for bro, snort and error with $METRON_HOME/bin/create_collection.sh (first argument is sensor name) before you restart.\r\n6. Or you can simply stop Metron Indexing and then start it.  This will trigger Ambari to automatically load the collections.\r\n7. Navigate to http://node1:8983/solr/#/snort/query or http://node1:8983/solr/#/bro/query and hit the \"Execute Search\" button.  You should see data.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot to digest here and still more questions to answer but this should get us started.  Outstanding items include:\r\n\r\n- What Solr parameters do we expose in Ambari?  All of them?\r\n- Do we want to add Solr collection functions to Service actions?  I don't see a way to make this conditional on the selected search engine so both options would always be shown\r\n- Need to review and add documentation\r\n- Support for REST configuration (probably a separate PR)\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

the CentOS development environment (`metron-deployment/development/centos6`) is based on an image [metron/centos_base](https://app.vagrantup.com/metron/boxes/centos_base) that has not been updated in 11 months.  This image is really just a snapshot of [bento/centos6.7](https://app.vagrantup.com/bento/boxes/centos-6.7) from 11 months ago. The [bento/centos6.7](https://app.vagrantup.com/bento/boxes/centos-6.7) image has not been updated in quite some time also.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the [centos/6](https://app.vagrantup.com/centos/boxes/6) image was updated 23 days ago. Presumably these images are receiving critical patches for long term support.\r\n\r\nWe should base the CentOS development environment `metron-deployment/development/centos6` on the [centos/6](https://app.vagrantup.com/centos/boxes/6) image so that we can be confident that Metron continues to work on the latest patches for the CentOS 6 series.\r\n\r\nThis would match what we do for the Ubuntu development environment which is based on  [ubuntu/trusty64](https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/trusty64).  This image continues to receive updates regularly despite the age of the Ubuntu 14 release.  It was updated just 3 days ago.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n1. Uses [centos/6](https://app.vagrantup.com/centos/boxes/6) as the base image for the CentOS development environment.\r\n\r\n1. Fixes a warning from Vagrant 2.0.2 which has deprecated the use of `TRUE`.\r\n\r\n1. Fixes a warning from Vagrant 2.0.2 that deprecates the use of `ansible.sudo`.\r\n\r\n1. Sets a new compatibility setting which should allow the environment to work across both Vagrant 1.8.1 and 2.0.2 better.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n1. Follow the README to launch the CentOS development environment.\r\n    * Run the Metron Service Check\r\n    * Ensure telemetry is visible within the Alerts UI\r\n\r\n1.

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\n**Root Cause**\r\nThe python-requests module introduced a VendorAlias import machinery in v2.5.2 and caused the sys.modules to break. This issue was later fixed in v2.6.1 of python-requests (see [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests)). \r\n\r\nThe solution is to use this version of python-requests, which fixed the issue.\r\n\r\n**Testing Done**\r\n\r\nOn CentOS 6 full dev\r\n- Validated python-requests v2.6.1 is installed \r\n- Checked for the Metron Indexing service state to be up. \r\n- Checked ambari-agent.log and the error was not seen.\r\n\r\nOn Ubuntu 14 full dev\r\n- Repeated the same steps as on CentOS 6 \r\n\r\n**Verification Steps**\r\n- Spin up full dev. \r\n- Verify Metron Indexing service is shown as up and running.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

is the next step forward to run Stellar in Zeppelin.  The end goal being to define executable use cases in a sharable, Zeppelin Notebook.  To get there we need to be able to connect to Zookeeper to push/pull configuration changes to Metron.  This PR allows us to interact with Zookeeper within the Stellar 'ZInterpreter'.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* This enhances the Stellar interpreter for Zeppelin to allow the user to set a `zookeeper.url` property.  \r\n\r\n    * If the property is defined, a Zk client connection is accessible by the Stellar functions executed within Zeppelin.  If no `zookeeper.url` is defined, then the behavior remains the same as before.\r\n\r\n* Multiple lines of Stellar can now be executed within the same block within a Zeppelin notebook.\r\n\r\n* Updates to the README simplify installation of the interpreter in Zeppelin.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-02-07 at 4 48 41 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/35943429-0284fba6-0c27-11e8-9e58-cd401d7f198b.png)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Follow the new README instructions (included in this PR) to build the interpreter and install it in Zeppelin.\r\n\r\n1. Launch a Zookeeper instance.\r\n\r\n1. Load up some basic configuration.  Create the standard Metron settings using `zkCli`.  It would look something like the following.\r\n    ```\r\n    create /metron \"\"\r\n    create /metron/topology \"\"\r\n    create /metron/topology/global \"{}\"\r\n    create /metron/topology/parsers \"{}\"\r\n    create /metron/topology/enrichments \"{}\"\r\n    create /metron/topology/indexing \"{}\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Set the zookeeper URL.  Go to the Interpreters > Stellar page and define a `zookeeper.url` property.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    zookeeper.url = localhost:2181\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Add the following dependencies to the interpreter so that we can access the metron-management functions.\r\n    \r\n    Yes, this is ugly.  We need to fix some of our dependencies in the metron-management project (and others.)\r\n\r\n    | artifact                                  | exclude                          |\r\n    |-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\r\n    | org.apache.metron:metron-management:0.4.3 |                                  |\r\n    | org.apache.metron:metron-common:0.4.3     |                                  |\r\n    | io.thekraken:grok:0.1.0                   | org.apache.commons:commons-lang3 |\r\n    | org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.2      |                                  |\r\n   \r\n    ![screen shot 2018-02-07 at 4 36 53 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/35943401-ebb035c6-0c26-11e8-9403-9cb69b752b0a.png)\r\n\r\n1. Save the interpreter changes, then open a notebook and execute the following. \r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    CONFIG_GET(\"GLOBAL\")\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    An empty set of globals should be returned from Zookeeper.\r\n\r\n1.  Run multiple expressions in a single Zeppelin code block.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    x := 2\r\n    y := 3\r\n    z := x + y\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Known Problems\r\n\r\n1. There is a problem that occurs with the Zk cache for some of the metron-management functions.  Calling `CONFIG_GET` will only ever return the first value that it gets from Zk.  If you change the globals via a `CONFIG_PUT`, the new values will NOT be reflected by calling `CONFIG_GET` until you restart the interpreter.  \r\n\r\n    This behavior differs from the CLI REPL.  I have been unable to determine why this is. I do not see anything in stellar-zeppelin that would cause this and am a little suspect of an issue in metron-management.  \r\n\r\n   Have an idea what the problem might be?  Let me know!\r\n\r\n

Contributor Comments\r\nCurrently the SolrWriter presumes a single collection to be written to.  The new collection strategy for Solr implies a collection per sensor.  Also, there are a few rough edges in the writer which could stand smoothing:\r\n* By default, we use solr's implicit commit mechanism, rather than committing at the batch granularity.  This may result in lost data on worker failure.\r\n* We do not use the the batch add api, but rather message-by-message add\r\n\r\n# Test Plan for Solr Writer\r\n\r\nThe intent of this PR is to get the SolrWriter to the point where solr\r\ncan be used as a random access index.  There are some manual steps\r\nrequired at this time due to this feature not being fully baked.  I will\r\nensure that those are obvious when I am stating them.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the assumption are:\r\n* An environment variable `METRON_HOME` (set to `/usr/metron/0.4.3`)\r\n* An environment variable `ZOOKEEPER` (set to `node1:2181`)\r\n\r\n## Preliminaries (optional)\r\n* Kill the profiler and batch indexing via:\r\n```\r\nstorm kill batch_indexing && storm kill profiler\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Solr Setup \r\nNote that in the future this will be automated either via ansible or the\r\nmanagement pack in Ambari.  Unless otherwise stated, run the commands as\r\n`root` (at least in full-dev, perhaps `metron` in a real cluster).\r\n\r\n* Kill the `random_access_indexing` topology:\r\n```\r\nstorm kill random_access_indexing\r\n```\r\n* Install the `metron-solr` RPM via `yum install metron-solr`\r\n* Run the solr installation script via `$METRON_HOME/bin/install_solr.sh`\r\n* Install the schemas, as the `solr` user (e.g. `sudo su - solr`)\r\n```\r\n/var/solr/solr-6.6.2/bin/solr create -c error -d /usr/metron/0.4.3/config/schema/error\r\n/var/solr/solr-6.6.2/bin/solr create -c bro -d /usr/metron/0.4.3/config/schema/bro\r\n/var/solr/solr-6.6.2/bin/solr create -c snort -d /usr/metron/0.4.3/config/schema/snort\r\n```\r\n* Fix a bug that will be corrected in the PR that ensures solr support\r\n  in the management pack by editing\r\n`$METRON_HOME/config/solr.properties`.\r\n  * Change `topology.auto-credentials=['']` to `topology.auto-credentials=[]`\r\n* It's unclear whether or not this is strictly required (probably not),\r\n  but I adjusted the `group.id` for the `random_access_indexing` topology by editing `$METRON_HOME/flux/indexing/random_access/remote.yaml`\r\n  * On line 67, change the `group.id` to `indexing-solr-ra`\r\n  * This is required so the kafka offsets are reset and the solr\r\n    topology pulls from the back of the queue rather than where the ES indexing topology left off.\r\n* Edit `$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/global.json` and add the following\r\n  property: `\"solr.zookeeper\" : \"localhost:9983\"` to the global config\r\n* Push the config to zookeeper via `$METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_util.sh -m PUSH -i $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper -z $ZOOKEEPER`\r\n* Start the solr indexing topology via `$METRON_HOME/bin/start_solr_topology.sh`\r\n\r\n## Validation\r\n\r\nYou can go to `http://node1:8983/solr/#/bro/query` and\r\n`http://node1:8983/solr/#/snort/query` and hit the `Execute Query`\r\nbutton to run queries against solr to ensure data shows up in the\r\n`snort` and `bro` collections\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1444\r\n\r\nAs of Ambari 2.6.0, the Ubuntu repoinfo.xml translation into an apt-get sources file has been fixed. See https://github.com/apache/ambari/commit/f8b29df9685b443d4a5c06c6e1725e4428c95b49#diff-6f26c26ed59462200d018c5e1e71e773\r\n\r\nThis PR updates Ambari from 2.5.2 to 2.6.1.0 in order to get the fix for Ubuntu repoinfo.xml processing.\r\n\r\n**Test**\r\n\r\nSpin up the Ubuntu full dev env. ES and Kibana should be installed without issue. Spot check that you see data populating the dashboard when you open Kibana.\r\n\r\nAlso check that centos full dev still works as expected with the Ambari upgrade.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

preferred way in which the heap size and other JVM options are set changed between ES 2.x and ES 5.x.  The project upgraded to ES 5.x as part of #840 , but the way the heap size is set by the Mpack was not changed.\r\n\r\nThis resulted in the heap size for Elasticsearch to be set incorrectly.  This also allows Elasticsearch to use up to 2G of heap when launched in the development environments, which is too much for a constrained single VM.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nThe user can set the heap size by populating the \"heap_size\" field under \"Advanced elastic-jvm-options\" in Ambari.  \r\n\r\nElasticsearch also exposes a large number of other settings in this file.  The entire content of the file was exposed in Ambari to allow users to also alter any other JVM options as needed.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-02-06 at 11 27 34 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/35870877-c3d310ce-0b30-11e8-9b07-e77ae3b7074c.png)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Launch a development environment; either Ubuntu or CentOS.  \r\n    * Ensure that telemetry reaches the Alerts UI.\r\n    * Run the Metron Service Check\r\n\r\n1. Login to the node and ensure that only a single `-Xms` and `-Xmx` option was passed to the JVM when launching Elasticsearch.  Ensure these are both set to the default heap size of 512mb.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    root@node1:/etc/elasticsearch# ps -ef | grep Elastic\r\n    root      1084 31038  0 16:09 pts/4    00:00:00 grep --color=auto Elastic\r\n    elastic+ 30048     1 23 16:08 ?        00:00:17 /usr/jdk64/jdk1.8.0_112/bin/java -Xms512m -Xmx512m -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=75 -XX:+UseCMSInitiatingOccupancyOnly -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -server -Xss1m -Djava.awt.headless=true -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Djna.nosys=true -Djdk.io.permissionsUseCanonicalPath=true -Dio.netty.noUnsafe=true -Dio.netty.noKeySetOptimization=true -Dio.netty.recycler.maxCapacityPerThread=0 -Dlog4j.shutdownHookEnabled=false -Dlog4j2.disable.jmx=true -Dlog4j.skipJansi=true -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -Des.path.home=/usr/share/elasticsearch -cp /usr/share/elasticsearch/lib/* org.elasticsearch.bootstrap.Elasticsearch -d -p /var/run/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.pid -Edefault.path.logs=/var/log/elasticsearch -Edefault.path.data=/var/lib/elasticsearch/ -Edefault.path.conf=/etc/elasticsearch/\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1.

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR fixes a bug in the Management UI that limits a user to only entering strings in the Advanced Config section.  This can be verified in full dev by navigating to the Management UI and editing the bro sensor.  Expand the Advanced Config by clicking on the \"Advanced\" link at the bottom of the main panel.  In the \"PARSER CONFIG\" section, enter a field name and `[\"value\"]` as the value.  Use Swagger to get the bro config and the parserConfig should look like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  \"parserConfig\": {\r\n    \"field\": [\"value\"]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBefore this PR the parserConfig would have been incorrectly converted to a string:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  \"parserConfig\": {\r\n    \"field\": \"[\\\"value\\\"]\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis will also work for json objects as well as arrays.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nRight now we always emit performance debugging fields in the split/join bolts.  We should only do that when debug logging is turned on for `org.apache.metron.enrichment.bolt`\r\n\r\nTest:\r\nSpin up full-dev and ensure that `adapter.*.begin.ts` and `adapter.*.end.ts` fields do not show up unless you set debug logging for `org.apache.metron.enrichment.bolt`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

would be useful for implementors to have the ability to ingest more complex documents without having to stand up a NiFi node/cluster.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for splitting multiple messages from a single message by way of using JSON Path statements to select the List element in the document.\r\n\r\nSince the parse() interface already returns a List<JSONObject> the scope of this change is in the parser.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n    {\r\n    \"foo\" :\r\n    [\r\n    { \"name\" : \"foo1\", \"value\" : \"bar\", \"number\" : 1.0 },\r\n    { \"name\" : \"foo2\", \"value\" : \"baz\", \"number\" : 2.0 }\r\n    ]\r\n    }\r\n ```\r\n\r\nwith JSON Path statement \"$.foo\" will result in two messages emitted from the parser\r\n\r\n```json\r\n { \"name\" : \"foo1\", \"value\" : \"bar\", \"number\" : 1.0 }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{ \"name\" : \"foo2\", \"value\" : \"baz\", \"number\" : 2.0 }\r\n```\r\nSupport in the configuration for a new configuration parameter: jsonpQuery has been added.\r\nAn example of the new configuration:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"parserClassName\":\"org.apache.metron.parsers.json.JSONMapParser\",\r\n  \"sensorTopic\":\"jsonMapQuery\",\r\n  \"parserConfig\": {\"jsonpQuery\":\"$.foo\"}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to integration test both with and without the query present, a new jsonMapQuery parser configuration has been added, with test data.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Testing\r\n- tests should run\r\n- deployment should work\r\n\r\n\r\n> NOTE.  There are three commits here to start\r\n1. The basic functionality\r\n2. checkstyle fixes\r\n3. small fix found later\r\n\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR is an initial attempt at creating a SolrDao that implements the IndexDao interface, is functionally equivalent to ElasticsearchDao and passes all tests in SearchIntegrationTest and UpdateIntegrationTest.  \r\n\r\nA high level summary of the changes include:\r\n\r\n- Upgraded the Solr client version to 6.6.0\r\n- Updated the SolrComponent to work with Solr 6.6 and added a couple convenience methods similar to ElasticsearchComponent\r\n- Added a new SolrDao implementation with all IndexDao methods implemented\r\n- Refactored the SearchIntegrationTest to work for both Solr and Elasticsearch and added an Solr implementation (more detail below)\r\n- Created an abstract UpdateIntegrationTest and added a Solr implementation\r\n- Added Solr schemas for test data sets\r\n- Added new tests to SearchIntegrationTest including filtering on fields with different types, faceting on fields with different types, and faceting on fields with missing types.\r\n- Broke the IndexDao down in the SolrDao to smaller, easier to understand classes.  The ElasticsearchDao class has become very large so I attempted to make the SolrDao more readable.\r\n\r\nThere were a couple areas where Elasticsearch and Solr behave slightly different.  I attempted to accommodated for that through the SolrDao implementation, by adjusting existing tests, and by splitting out specific tests:\r\n\r\n- Column metadata is different between the 2 search engines so each implementation has their own tests\r\n- There are cases where the clients will return different types in search results.  I am handling this in SearchIntegrationTest by first converting the types to strings and then comparing (other ideas?).  For example, the ES client returns an Integer for timestamp while Solr returns a Long.\r\n- There are cases where ES throws an error under certain conditions while Solr does not (and vice-versa).  These were moved to either ES or Solr SearchIntegrationTest implementations.\r\n- There is no support in Solr for sorting group results so I am sorting them client-side instead.\r\n\r\nAt this point the scope is limited to tests passing, meaning metron-elasticsearch and metron-solr pass all tests.  There are other PRs in progress that are needed before automated testing with full dev can be done.  I am still actively working on manually testing in full dev and adding documentation but this should get us started.\r\n\r\nThis PR is intended to be merged into the upgrade-solr feature branch but I have it set to master temporarily so review is easier.  We will need to merge in master to the feature branch to get rid of the extra commits since this PR is up to date with master.\r\n\r\nI'm expecting a lengthy review and would request multiple reviewers and +1s.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nCurrently jackson is used as part of our internal API to JSONUtils.  The problem here is when we shade and relocate jackson.  Suddenly we can't use JSONUtils.  We should avoid operating on jackson primitives and rather provide a convenient wrapper around the places where we use jackson as part of the API.\r\n\r\nThis is required for #907 because this is where we are forced to relocate jackson and there is a competing version on the classpath.\r\n\r\nValidate by running up vagrant and ensuring data flows through all topologies, data shows up in the alerts UI.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR cleans up SearchIntegrationTest which will make it easier to create a Solr implementation.  Changes include:\r\n\r\n- Updated the \"all_query_returns_all_results\" method in SearchIntegrationTest to only contain a single test rather than also including duplicate tests that were moved to their own methods during the ES 5 upgrade work.  Tests that were not duplicated were moved to their own method.\r\n- Removed logic from ElasticsearchSearchIntegrationTest that rewrites guids without the `-` character.  This made the tests confusing because different ids were being used for validation and is no longer needed.\r\n- Metaalert data was removed and tests involving metaalerts were updated to use other sensors instead.  There is no reason for metaalerts to be included here as there are other dedicated metaalert integration tests. \r\n- Improved the \"get_all_latest_guid\" test by using guids from different sensor types.\r\n\r\nAll tests should still run after this change.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1428\r\n\r\nTravis is failing because of npm downstream package problems. The chain of dependencies went like this: karma-remap-istanbul ^0.2.1 -> remap-istanbul some version or another -> source-map ver 7.0.0. The problem came with an api change of sorts to source-map. remap-istanbul has made a patch version in 0.9.6 to fix the dependency, and in order to get the proper remap-istanbul version that limits the pool of source-map versions, I had to upgrade karma-remap-istanbul to 0.6.0. This fixed the chain of dependencies without seemingly breaking anything else along the way, thankfully.\r\n\r\nI have to look at what we do with the UI libraries for licensing reporting, as I currently have no idea yet what that looks like, so I'll update that shortly. For now, I wanted to see if this gets the build working, at the very least.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nRight now our ambari mpack won't run cleanly on HDP 2.6 and Storm 1.1 because of some classpath issues and not supporting the stack.  We should migrate fulldev to run 2.6 (while still working with 2.5) and validate that we work with storm 1.1.   The only code changes in here is relocating and shading jackson (kerberized storm 1.1 requires a conflicting version of jackson from ES and us, so we shade and relocate it in parsers, but didn't in profiler and elasticsearch uber jars.  This PR corrects that).  \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can validate this by:\r\n* Running up full-dev and ensuring data flows through\r\n* Kerberizing full-dev and ensure things still work\r\n\r\nI have done the above, but you can feel free to do the same.  \r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1426\r\n\r\nSensor indexing config has a race condition with ZK cache. A similar fix has been made before, but there remained a few test assertions that still potentially had this issue - https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/795\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nRun mvn clean install and verify tests pass. Also, Travis should pass more than once.\r\n\r\n**Side note:** As of submission, there appears to be separate Travis infrastructure issues that are causing timeouts. Will update as new info is available.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nAddresses https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1400\r\n\r\nThis file hasn't been touched since at least 2016, but the file=sys.stdout arg to the Logging statement is causing errors. I removed it and changed the ES host:port info to pull from the Ambari configs as we probably wanted all along. The regex is similar to what we did to setup links for ES health and indexes under ES Ambari Quicklinks.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Basic Test\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev\r\n2. Open Ambari at http://node1:8080\r\n3. Click on Elasticsearch in the service list\r\n4. Verify ES is running. Start it if it is not running.\r\n5. Click \"Service Actions\" and choose \"Run Service Check\" from the dropdown\r\n6. The service check should pass\r\n\r\n### Check ES http port\r\n\r\n1. Click on Elasticsearch in the service list\r\n2. Select \"Configs\" in the tabs across the top of the page\r\n3. Enter \"http_port\" in the filter box\r\n4. Change the default \"9200-9300\" value to something else, e.g. \"9700-9800\"\r\n5. Click save and restart ES\r\n6. Once ES comes up again, click \"Service Actions\" and choose \"Run Service Check\" again from the dropdown\r\n7. The service check should still pass\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR adds a single node, VM based deployment mechanism based on Ubuntu Trusty.  This has feature parity with the existing CentOS single node VM.  This will help us continue to improve and support the Ubuntu-based DEB packages that were added in #868.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* The Metron, Elasticsearch, and Kibana MPacks were updated to support installation on Ubuntu.  This included making the following changes.\r\n\r\n    * Adding repo definitions for Ubuntu\r\n    * Changing the default location of the `/etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch` configuration to work across platforms\r\n    * Adding an additional configuration in the MPack to allow Elasticsearch to perform a memory lock on Ubuntu\r\n    * Support configuration of Elasticsearch on a platform running Systemd; like Ubuntu \r\n\r\n* The Elasticsearch MPack was enhanced to correctly perform a service check.  Previously the hostname and port were hard coded and the service check was not functional in most environments.\r\n\r\n* The Ubuntu DEBs were enhanced to allow for the addition of \"maintainer scripts\".  This allows the Management UI and Alerts UI service scripts to be installed with the DEBs.  This was needed to reach feature parity with the RPMs.\r\n\r\n* The name `full-dev-platform` no longer makes sense IMHO.  We do not have a `quick-dev-platform` any longer to distinguish it from.  Now the main distinguisher is the underlying operating system.  I renamed our \"Full Dev\" development environment to `metron-on-centos` and `metron-on-ubuntu`.  I am completely open to community suggestions on what these should be named.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    metron-deployment/development/\r\n    ├── README.md\r\n    ├── fastcapa\r\n    ├── centos6\r\n    └── ubuntu14\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n* The organization of `metron-deployment` had to change so that assets could be reused across both the CentOS and Ubuntu deployments.  All shared Ansible assets were moved to `metron-deployment/ansible`.  This includes the Ansible modules, playbooks and roles that are all used across multiple environments.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    metron-deployment/ansible/\r\n    ├── extra_modules\r\n    ├── playbooks\r\n    └── roles\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n* The following Ansible roles had to be updated to support both CentOS and Ubuntu based on small differences in package names and conventions.\r\n\r\n    * `ambari-common` \r\n    * `ambari-config`\r\n    * `ambari-master`\r\n    * `ambari-slave`\r\n    * `libselinux-python`\r\n    * `ntp`\r\n\r\n* A new role was added to enable swap space; `enable-swap`.  This is required for the Ubuntu deployment as the underlying Ubuntu Trusty image does not have swap space enabled by default.\r\n\r\n* The `metron-builder` role was changed to selectively build either the DEBs or the RPMs as needed.\r\n\r\n* The `metron-rpms` role was renamed to `metron-packages` and was also enhanced to create the local repository on a Ubuntu host.  This also selectively copies either RPMs or DEBs to the VM as needed.\r\n\r\n* Monit is no longer needed and so has been removed from all VM deployments.  Monit was added prior to the existence of our Mpack installer.  It is no longer needed\r\n\r\n* Removed the `metron-streaming` role which is no longer applicable since these functions are now performed by the MPack.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI have performed the following testing based on these changes.\r\n\r\n- [x] Run Metron on CentOS.  \r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/development/centos6\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    * Validate that alerts are visible within the Alerts UI.\r\n    * Validate that the Metron Service Check completes successfully.\r\n    * Validate that the Elasticsearch service check completes successfully.\r\n\r\n    Be sure to shutdown and halt or destroy this VM before moving on to the next step.\r\n\r\n- [x] Run Metron on Ubuntu.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/development/ubuntu14\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    * Validate that alerts are visible within the Alerts UI.\r\n    * Validate that the Metron Service Check completes successfully.\r\n    * Validate that the Elasticsearch service check completes successfully.\r\n\r\n    Be sure to shutdown and halt or destroy this VM before moving on to the next step.\r\n\r\n- [x] Run one of the Fastcapa test environments.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/development/fastcapa/centos-7.1/\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    * If the process fails at the task \"fastcapa : Restart for modified kernel params\" simply run `vagrant provision` again.\r\n    * Ensure that the deployment process reports success.  Automated validation is performed as part of the deployment process.\r\n\r\n- [x] Deploy Metron to AWS EC2.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/amazon-ec2\r\n    ./run.sh\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    * Validate that alerts are visible within the Alerts UI.\r\n    * Validate that the Metron Service Check completes successfully.\r\n    * Validate that the Elasticsearch service check completes successfully.","created_at":"2018-01-23T15:55:47Z","updated_at":"2018-09-17T19:28:24Z","closed_at":"2018-01-27T22:51:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6e7b8d43ce1d432519d566687147c54d5610bf70","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/903/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/903/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/903/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/55ce441d5010dbeb251325a9323975cfffe9e4ab","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-1370-PR","ref":"METRON-1370-PR","sha":"55ce441d5010dbeb251325a9323975cfffe9e4ab","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

Contributor Comments\r\nThe sed commands in Upgrading.md for the alert field can be problematic on some versions of sed, including what's on Vagrant if you ran the instructions from there.\r\n\r\nThe commands will fail with a file not found error as-is (and can be tested by running the old version).  When running the new versions, the intended result is correct: The wrapping chunk with the template name is removed, and the alerts field is added.  Removing the wrapping chunk is to make it possible to resubmit to ES (Because it doesn't give an immediately resubmittable version), and the alert field is for querying.\r\n\r\nThis can be tested by spinning up full dev, running the old versions and seeing the error, followed by running the new version successfully.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThe relevant files are already in git, it's a trivial fix to just add the reinclusion.

Contributor Comments\r\nCreating a kafka topic using the rest endpoint doesn't add the required ACL to topic for the current user automatically. This will cause the all other kafka operation rest endpoints fail including listing the topics.  Added code to automatically add the required ACL to the current use while creating new topic. \r\n\r\n**Steps to Verify manually**\r\n1. Spin up Full Dev\r\n2. Go to Swagger at http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#/kafka-controller\r\n3. Create a kafka topic using (/api/v1/kafka/topic)\r\n4. List all the kafka topics using (/api/v1/kafka/topic) \r\n5. You should see the list of all kafka topics including newly created topic without any authorization error.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nCreating a kafka topic using the rest endpoint doesn't add the required ACL to topic for the current user automatically. This will cause the all other kafka operation rest endpoints fail including listing the topics.  \r\n\r\n**Steps to Verify manually**\r\n1. Spin up Full Dev\r\n2. Go to Swagger at http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html#/kafka-controller\r\n3. Create a kafka topic using (/api/v1/kafka/topic)\r\n4. List all the kafka topics using (/api/v1/kafka/topic) \r\n5. You should see the list of all kafka topics including newly created topic without any authorization error.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nIn recent versions of Ambari, [Shiro Authentication](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.6.0/security/shiroauthentication.html) is enabled on the Zeppelin server, which requires a user/password authentication in order to interact with Zeppelin REST API. \r\n\r\nThis pull request adds support for using the Shiro auth credentials and thus being able to import Zeppelin notebooks. Backward compatibility with non-authenticated Zeppelin has been maintained as well so that the full dev platform (which runs on an older Ambari version) is not broken.\r\n\r\n**Steps to test the PR**\r\n* In Ambari UI, go to Services -> Metron -> 'Service Actions' dropdown -> 'Zeppelin Notebook Import'\r\n* Validate that the Metron notebooks are imported by launching the Zeppelin UI (Service -> Zeppelin Notebook -> 'Quick Links' dropdown -> Zeppelin UI)\r\n\r\n**Testing Done**\r\n* Ran the changes against Ambari ver 2.6.0.0 (which uses Shiro authentication) and verified that notebooks are imported properly\r\n* Ran the changes against Ambari ver 2.4.2.0 (which does not uses Shiro authentication) and verified that notebooks are imported properly\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nA bug was recently discovered that causes a NPE when calling ElasticsearchColumnMetadataDao.getColumnMetadata to get ES column types.  It can be recreated by adding a template to ES that matches all indices and also contains a doc type mapping without the \"properties\" property.  For example:\r\n```\r\ncurl -XPUT 'http://node1:9200/_template/default_string_template' -d '\r\n {\r\n   \"template\": \"*\",\r\n   \"mappings\" : {\r\n     \"bro_type\": {\r\n       \"dynamic_templates\": [\r\n         {\r\n           \"strings\": {\r\n             \"match_mapping_type\": \"string\",\r\n             \"mapping\": {\r\n               \"type\": \"text\"\r\n             }\r\n           }\r\n         }\r\n       ]\r\n     }\r\n   }\r\n }\r\n```\r\nA NPE should now happen when calling the REST endpoint to get column metadata for bro.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that bug by first checking to see if the \"properties\" property exists and continuing on if it does not.  I also added an additional mapping in ElasticsearchSearchIntegrationTest that mimics this condition.  Happy to remove it if people feel it's unnecessary.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Stellar in a Zeppelin Notebook\r\n\r\nThe goal of this effort was to have the shell-like experience of the command-line driven REPL, but inside a web-based Zeppelin Notebook.  This makes the existing functionality provided by the REPL more accessible and approachable for the average user.  \r\n\r\nThis also opens up interesting additional scenarios like \"executable\" use cases or plotting profile data.  Definitely more work to do on those fronts, but this is a first step.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n1. There was a good amount of refactoring that I needed to do to achieve this.  Prior to this effort different aspects of the REPL's functionality were tied together in the `StellarShell` class.  To be able to have the same shell-like experience in both the REPL and Zeppelin, I needed to factor this logic out separately to allow for reuse.  \r\n\r\n    This included the following bits.\r\n     * Console logic tied to the AESH library\r\n     * Stellar execution logic\r\n     * Autocomplete logic\r\n     * Variable assignment (only available in the shell)\r\n     * Magics\r\n     * Docstrings\r\n     * Comments\r\n     * `quit`\r\n\r\n1. We had very few automated tests around the shell/REPL, primarily because all these bits were tied together, which made testing difficult.  Separating out this logic allowed me to add a large number of unit tests around each of these pieces of logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. This also adds a separate project `metron-stellar/stellar-zeppelin` that provides a Zeppelin interpreter that allow you to run Stellar in a notebook.  The interpreter acts as the front-end that then re-uses all of the bits that I refactored as described above.\r\n\r\n### What does this do?\r\n\r\n1. This allows you to run Stellar expressions in a Zeppelin Notebook.\r\n\r\n    ![stellar in a zeppelin notebook](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/34359107-1b676b66-ea23-11e7-96a6-f3b93b963992.png)\r\n\r\n1. This provides auto-complete in the Zeppelin Notebook by pressing the <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> keys.\r\n\r\n    ![stellar in a notebook - autocomplete](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/34359112-2305eb4a-ea23-11e7-940a-8b45f0af559b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this not do?\r\n\r\nThis does not automatically prepare the Zeppelin environment to run Stellar.  Meaning it does not install the Stellar interpreter in Zeppelin.  You have to manually install the zinterpreter in Zeppelin by following the directions described in the `metron-stellar/stellar-zepelin` README.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nRun Stellar in Notebook\r\n1. Build Metron.\r\n1. Follow the instructions in `metron-stellar/stellar-zepelin/README.md` to download/run Zeppelin locally.\r\n1. Follow the same instructions to execute Stellar expressions in a Zeppelin Notebook.\r\n1. Use <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> to try out autocomplete.\r\n    \r\nValidate the CLI REPL\r\n1. Deploy Full Dev\r\n1. Run the existing CLI-driven REPL\r\n1. Validate that we have feature parity\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
