Similar to https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/28045\r\n- Pre-combine before shuffle (both reduce by key and GBK)\r\n- Disable bundling in batch mode (except for pre-combine). Lower the default bundle size since the new behavior puts pressure on the heap.  \r\n\r\nIt also implements the following optimizations:\r\n\r\n- Use a \"lazy\" split enumerator to distributes split dynamically rather than eagerly. This new enumerator greatly reduces skew as each slot is able to pull new splits to consume only when it has finished its work.\r\n- Set the default `maxParallelism` to `parallelism` as the total number of key groups is equal to `maxParallelism`. Again this reduces skew.\r\n- Make `ToKeyedWorkItem`  part of `DoFnOperator` which reduces the size of the job graph and avoid unnecessary inter-task communication.\r\n- Force a common slot-sharing group on every bounded IOs. This emulate the behavior of the Dataset API which again improves performances especially when data is being shuffled several times while partitioning keys are unchanged (for example of the job does `GBK -> map -> CombinePerKey`). Add a flag to control this feature (defaults to active).\r\n- Use a custom class for keys which guarantee a good distribution of data even when the number of keys is not >> parallelism. \r\n- Other minor optimizations removing repeated serde work.\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks\r\n\r\nThe patched version was tested against a few of Spotify's production batch workflows. All settings were left unchanged except for the followings:\r\n\r\n- passed `--useDatastreamForBatch=true`\r\n- set `jobmanager.scheduler: default` (otherwise datastream default to adaptive scheduler).\r\n\r\n|       |           | Beam 2.56 - dataset | Beam 2.56 - datastream |        | Beam 2.56 - datastream patched |         |\r\n| ----- | --------: | ------------------: | ---------------------: | -----: | -----------------------------: | ------: |\r\n| job   | # workers |      execution time |         execution time | % diff |                 execution time |  % diff |\r\n| Job 1 |       350 |             2:19:00 |    fails after 4h29min |      - |                        1:43:00 | -25.90% |\r\n| Job 2 |       160 |             0:23:00 |                0:35:00 | 52.17% |                        0:22:36 |  -1.74% |\r\n| Job 3 |       200 |             0:53:08 |                1:34:39 | 78.14% |                         failed |       - |\r\n| Job 4 |       160 |             2:31:20 |                4:27:00 | 76.43% |                        2:19:35 |  -7.76% |\r\n| Job 5 |         1 |             0:43:00 |             not tested |      - |                        0:38:00 | -11.63% |\r\n| Job 6 |       300 |             3:01:00 |             not tested |      - |                        2:55:00 |         |\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n\r\nJob 3 fails with a stackoverflow exception because of [a bug in versions of Kryo < 3.0](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo/issues/341). I believe this is because the job uses `taskmanager.runtime.large-record-handler: true` and it should be fixed in Flink 2.0 since Kryo is upgraded to a more recent version.  \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

this PR is to pin pip to version 24.1, so that `pip check` would not fail on xgboost-1.7.6 and grpcio-1.66.1.\r\n\r\nAfter some attempts, it seems it is a bit inconvenient to enforce pip version, especially inside the venv set up by tox.\r\n \r\nTherefore, we decide to make the following changes\r\n1) for xgboost, since we don't have any plan to invest further on it, we are going to remove it from deps.  After that, the xgboost related tests in the ML test suite will be skipped. We can put it back in the future if we decide to support xgboost again (https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/31252) .\r\n\r\n2) for grpcio, the failure only occurs on MacOS, so we decide to skip `pip check` on MacOS until https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/37660 is fixed.\r\n\r\n#fixes

an on_error callback where throttling counter is incremented when GCS throttling happens.\r\n\r\n- A new retry object is needed for invoking a custom on_error callback. We derive this retry object based on the default retry object from gcs client library.\r\n- Default retry object is replaced with the new retry object in all API calls.\r\n- ~~Both copy_batch and delete_batch are reimplemented without client.batch() so retry will happen if a retriable exception is caught.~~\r\n- Two new pipeline options are introduced here: `--no_gcsio_throttling_counter` and `--enable-gcsio-blob-generation`.\r\n\r\nThis is a second attempt for this feature. \r\n- We use the on_error() callback here, because there is no other callback when a retry happens. \r\n- Additionally, when on_error() is invoked, only the raised exception is provided as an argument. To find out the exact time caused by GCS throttling (i.e. the sleep time due to throttling), we use inspect to get the sleep time from the caller of on_error(). \r\n\r\nThe previous PR is at

PR adds a model handler for running inference using [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm). To leverage vLLM's dynamic batching, this spins up a central vLLM serving process, coordinated by a single global model wrapper, which individual worker threads can send RPCs to.\r\n\r\nTesting this is tricky since it requires a gpu; I followed the same pattern we use for TensorRT - just launch some examples directly on Dataflow and validate that they run to completion. I didn't do any kind of result validation since results produced by a LLM are non-deterministic.\r\n\r\nPart of https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/32528\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

debug other possible encoding positions issues in the future:\r\n- ensure that only a single RowCoder is created for a given UUID by using synchronization when generating coders\r\n- add some logging

PR addresses the performance overhead caused by repeated string concatenation in the toString() method of the MetricName and MetricKey classes. The issue was identified as a significant contributor to CPU usage during metric processing in Beam’s Samza integration.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this, the toString() results for MetricName and MetricKey are now cached. By storing the computed string representation on first access, we eliminate redundant concatenation operations in subsequent calls. This change reduces the computational cost associated with metrics processing, leading to improved performance in scenarios with frequent metric updates.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

We consider the issues low-priority, so even if you see automated scanners saying otherwise, don't be scared.</p>\n<h2>4.0.4</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>fix: Update picomatch to fix regression <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/micromatch/micromatch/issues/179\">#179</a> (8becb55)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>4.0.3</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Enforce newer version of picomatch with bugfixes</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">micromatch's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>[4.0.8] - 2024-08-22</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>backported CVE-2024-4067 fix (from v4.0.6) over to 4.x branch</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>[4.0.7] - 2024-05-22</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>this is basically v4.0.5, with some README updates</li>\n<li><strong>it is vulnerable to CVE-2024-4067</strong></li>\n<li>Updated braces to v3.0.3 to avoid CVE-2024-4068</li>\n<li>does NOT break API compatibility</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>[4.0.6] - 2024-05-21</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>hasBraces</code> to check if a pattern contains braces.</li>\n<li>Fixes CVE-2024-4067</li>\n<li><strong>BREAKS API COMPATIBILITY</strong></li>\n<li>Should be labeled as a major release, but it's not.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>[4.0.1 - 4.0.5]</h2>\n<h2>[4.0.0] - 2019-03-20</h2>\n<h3>Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Adds support for <code>options.onMatch</code>. See the readme for details</li>\n<li>Adds support for <code>options.onIgnore</code>. See the readme for details</li>\n<li>Adds support for <code>options.onResult</code>. See the readme for details</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Breaking changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Require Node.js &gt;= 8.6</li>\n<li>Removed support for passing an array of brace patterns to <code>micromatch.braces()</code>.</li>\n<li>To strictly enforce closing brackets (for <code>{</code>, <code>[</code>, and <code>(</code>), you must now use <code>strictBrackets=true</code> instead of <code>strictErrors</code>.</li>\n<li><code>cache</code> - caching and all related options and methods have been removed</li>\n<li><code>options.unixify</code> was renamed to <code>options.windows</code></li>\n<li><code>options.nodupes</code> Was removed. Duplicates are always removed by default. You can override this with custom behavior by using the <code>onMatch</code>, <code>onResult</code> and <code>onIgnore</code> functions.</li>\n<li><code>options.snapdragon</code> was removed, as snapdragon is no longer used.</li>\n<li><code>options.sourcemap</code> was removed, as snapdragon is no longer used, which provided sourcemap support.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>[3.0.0] - 2017-04-11</h2>\n<p>Complete overhaul, with 36,000+ new unit tests validated against actual output generated by Bash and minimatch. More specifically, 35,000+ of the tests:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>micromatch results are directly compared to bash results</li>\n<li>in rare cases, when micromatch and bash disagree, micromatch's results are compared to minimatch's results</li>\n<li>micromatch is much more accurate than minimatch, so there were cases where I had to make assumptions. I'll try to document these.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This refactor introduces a parser and compiler that are supersets of more granular parsers and compilers from other sub-modules. Each of these sub-modules has a singular responsibility and focuses on a certain type of matching that aligns with a specific part of the Bash &quot;expansion&quot; API.</p>\n<p>These sub-modules work like plugins to seamlessly create the micromatch parser/compiler, so that strings are parsed in one pass, an <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/099c8914f56529f75bc757cc9e5e8e2a\">AST is created</a>, then a new string is generated by the compiler.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Context\r\n\r\nFlink will drop support for the dataset API in 2.0 which should be released by EOY so it quite important for Beam to support Datastream well. \r\n\r\n## The PR\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the performances of Batch jobs executed with `--useDatastreamForBatch`  by porting the following performance optimizations already present in `FlinkBatchTransformTranslators` but lacking in `FlinkStreamingTransformTranslators`.  \r\n\r\n- Limit the max size of source splits. Similar to https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/28045\r\n- Pre-combine before shuffle (both reduce by key and GBK)\r\n- Disable bundling in batch mode (except for pre-combine). Lower the default bundle size since the new behavior puts pressure on the heap.  \r\n\r\nIt also implements the following optimizations:\r\n\r\n- Use a \"lazy\" split enumerator to distributes split dynamically rather the eagerly. This new enumerator greatly reduces skew as each slot is able to pull new splits to consume only when it has finished its work.\r\n- Set the default `maxParallelism` to `parallelism` as the total number of splits is equal to `maxParallelism`. Again this reduces skew.\r\n- Make `ToKeyedWorkItem`  part of `DoFnOperator` which reduces the size of the job graph and avoid unnecessary inter-task communication.\r\n- Force a common slot-sharing group on every bounded IOs. This emulate the behavior of the Dataset API which again improves performances especially when data is being shuffled several times while partitioning keys are unchanged (for example of the job does `GBK -> map -> CombinePerKey`). Add a flag to control this feature (defaults to active).\r\n- Other minor optimizations removing repeated serde work.\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks\r\n\r\nThe patched version was tested against a few of Spotify's production batch workflows. All settings were left unchanged except for the followings:\r\n\r\n- passed `--useDatastreamForBatch=true`\r\n- set `jobmanager.scheduler: default` (otherwise datastream default to adaptive scheduler).\r\n\r\n|       |           | Beam 2.56 - dataset | Beam 2.56 - datastream |        | Beam 2.56 - datastream patched |         |\r\n| ----- | --------: | ------------------: | ---------------------: | -----: | -----------------------------: | ------: |\r\n| job   | # workers |      execution time |         execution time | % diff |                 execution time |  % diff |\r\n| Job 1 |       350 |             2:19:00 |    fails after 4h29min |      - |                        1:43:00 | -25.90% |\r\n| Job 2 |       160 |             0:23:00 |                0:35:00 | 52.17% |                        0:22:36 |  -1.74% |\r\n| Job 3 |       200 |             0:53:08 |                1:34:39 | 78.14% |                         failed |       - |\r\n| Job 4 |       160 |             2:31:20 |                4:27:00 | 76.43% |                        2:19:35 |  -7.76% |\r\n| Job 5 |         1 |             0:43:00 |             not tested |      - |                        0:38:00 | -11.63% |\r\n| Job 6 |       300 |             2:58:51 |             not tested |      - |                        running |         |\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n\r\nJob 3 fails with a stackoverflow exception because if [a bug in old version of Kryo](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo/issues/341). I believe this is because the job uses `taskmanager.runtime.large-record-handler: true` and it should be fixed in Flink 2.0 since Kryo is upgraded to a more recent version.  \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

to #26329, also fix #20100, #21076\r\n\r\nWhen using `readWithDatumReader` and `DIRECT_READ` method, the transform would fail because the `parseFn` is expected. Refactor the IO so the avro `datumReader` can be use in both cases.\r\n\r\nIn some case, it is required to get the data with the desired schema. Currently, BQ io always uses the writer schema (or table schema). Create new APIs to set the reader schema.\r\n\r\n~~This refactoring contains some breaking changes:~~\r\n\r\n~~`withFormat` is not exposed anymore. Indeed, it is not possible to configure a `TypedRead` with a `DatumReaderFactory` and change the format later. Data format MUST be chosen when creating the transform.~~\r\n\r\n~~In the `TypedRead.Builder`, replace the `DatumReaderFactory` with the `BigQueryReaderFactory` allowing to handle both avro and arrow in uniform fashion. This alters the `BigQueryIOTranslation`.\r\nI need some help on that point to handle that in a better way.~~\r\n\r\nEdit: reworked part of this PR to keep

pointed out in https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/32237#issuecomment-2315911281 this test can be flaky. This tests that after `20` is processed (and times out) **and** at least 10 (2*timeout) seconds have passed, that the model will be full deleted.\r\n\r\nRight now, it relies on timing and assumes that the pcollection will be processed in order (or at least the `20` will be processed early). This tries to deflake the test by adding some more elements which are guaranteed to timeout to ensure that after the first times out, sufficient time will pass for garbage collection to occur. It does admittedly lengthen the time to run to ~1 minute, unfortunately.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

KafkaIO read withDuplicates to warn but still commit offsets if configured\r\n\r\nTwo ways to enable commits, \r\n1) explicitly via commitOffsetsInFinalize()\r\n2) Via consumer config  ENABLE_AUTO_COMMIT_CONFIG=true\r\n\r\nIf the first is true, redistribute can't be enabled\r\nIf the second is true, the pipeline can still be passed, but isn't the most optimal, since if the runner wants to enable duplicates, there is no point of introducing the additional overhead of checkpointing messages within Kafka itself., though it is not semantically incorrect.  The first option uses internal beam state to track which messages have been processed for preventing duplicates, which doesn't make sense if we also have a runner hint that duplicates can be allowed. \r\n\r\nBefore this fix, it just meant customers weren't able to set withRedistribute on the transform, even if commits weren't configured. \r\n\r\nUpdated tests to catch this. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
