for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nEnable TransformWithStateInPandas operator to write new versions of state metadata and state schema. This will enable state metadata source and state data source reader. And will also support future schema evolution changes.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this purpose, in this PR, we add a new implementation of driver side Python runner. This is because spark will need to get the state schema on the driver during planning inside `IncrementalExecution`. We will also need to start another state server in the new driver side Python runner to handle API calls in init().\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is to match with the new versions of state metadata and state schema version implemented in Scala side of TransformWithState.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\nBut now users will be able to get results from state metadata source reader and state data source reader using the same API as Scala. E.g. for state metadata source reader, we can now read out state metadata as follows:\r\n```\r\nmetadata_df = spark.read.format(\"state-metadata\").load(checkpoint_path)\r\n```\r\nAnd we can read out state rows by using state data source as follows:\r\n```\r\nlist_state_df = spark.read.format(\"statestore\")\\\r\n  .option(\"path\", checkpoint_path)\\\r\n  .option(\"stateVarName\", \"listState\")\\\r\n  .load()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdd unit tests in `python/pyspark/sql/tests/pandas/test_pandas_transform_with_state.py`. Test state metadata and state schema files are written correctly by using state metadata source reader and state data source reader.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the rule PruneFileSourcePartitions where CatalogFileIndex gets converted into InMemoryFileIndex for partitioned tables, if the same tables are referenced multiple times ( with identical filters or otherwise or even with empty filters ( case being translated filter string for pushdown becomes empty), each leaf table will call the HMS layer to get partitions list. \r\nThis PR collects identical tables and its corresponding partition filters and makes a single call to HMS (HiveMetaStor) layer for getting the basic minimum partitions which statisfy each occurence.  Using the base InMemoryIndex , then each table can further apply its own filters ( if needed) to get the desired InMemoryIndex.\r\n\r\nFor eg if Table A  has 2 occurences, each with Filter f1 and Filter f2.\r\n1) Table A.     f1\r\n2) Table A.     f2\r\nA single call to HMS will be made passing the filter condition as f1 || f2\r\nThis will result in baseInMemoryFileIndex.\r\nThen 1) Table A  can apply filter f1 on this baseInMemoryFileIndex to get its own pruned file index.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis has been observed as a major perf bottleneck for complex queries where there are large number of partitions.\r\nIn this particular client,  query compilation/execution time got increased to 6 hrs from 20 mins.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nvalidated using existing tests and added new tests in the file HivePruneFileSourcePartitionsSuite which validate the reduction in HMS calls. The correctness of the results were validated without this change ( I will modify the test to include result validations)\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFixing the canonicalization of build keys in the DynamicPruningSubquery so that build keys are canonicalized relative to build query

The bug appeared as two DynamicPruningSubquery though equivalent,  on canonicalization, were not matching. It turned out that the build keys expression were getting canonicalized relative to itself, instead of build query 's output.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplementing equals and hashCode in the InMemoryBatchScan and  InMemoryV2FilterBatchScan so that the pushed runtime filters are taken into account.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThese test classes need the change so that the issue of re-use of exchange not happening in AQE when runtime filters are pushed to scan levels,  can be reproduced. Currently either the tests are not actually validating the reuse of exchange happening when dynamic pruning expressions are pushed to scan levels in partitioned key based joins, or they are false passing because the equality of the test scans are not taking into account runtime filters.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis is test class change., It is possibe that the existing tests may fail till the dependent fixes are made in source code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nno","created_at":"2024-12-11T20:42:07Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T20:50:39Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c4cfded901f5223c8d004cc0252ad4812ca0907b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49153/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49153/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49153/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a5b510f0ff01571cab017feb0fc1c4180224b7b0","head":{"label":"ahshahid:SPARK-45926","ref":"SPARK-45926","sha":"a5b510f0ff01571cab017feb0fc1c4180224b7b0","user":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105594707,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU1OTQ3MDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"ahshahid/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe main change in this PR is to augment the trait of SupportsRuntimeV2Filtering by adding two new methods\r\n`default boolean equalToIgnoreRuntimeFilters(Scan other) {\r\n    return this.equals(other);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  default int hashCodeIgnoreRuntimeFilters() {\r\n    return this.hashCode();\r\n  }`\r\n\r\nwhich the underlying V2 Scan should implement.\r\nThe BatchScanExec also gets modified accordingly where it invokes this two methods to check the equality of the Scan.\r\n\r\nPls note that this PR includes code of 2 other PRs too\r\n1) [SPARK-45658](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/49154)\r\nThis PR though not required per se, but is good to have for correctness ( & my other PR for broadcast var pushdown relies on this  fix)\r\n2) [SPARK-45926](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/49153)\r\nThis PR is necessary to reproduce the issue and hence its code is needed for this PR to show the issue.\r\n\r\n**Also for this test to pass the code of DataSourceV2Relation.computeStats should disable throwing assertion error in testing, as that is a separate bug which gets hit, when the bug test for this PR is run.. So for now to allow the bug test to pass, I have modified the Utils.isTesting to avoid hitting the IllegalStateException**\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis change is need IMO to fix the issue of re-use of exchange not happening when DPP filters are pushed to the scan level.\r\nThe issue is this:\r\nIn certain types of queries for eg TPCDS Query 14b, the reuse of exchange does not happen in AQE , resulting in perf degradation.\r\nThe spark TPCDS tests are unable to catch the problem, because the InMemoryScan used for testing do not implement the equals & hashCode correctly , in the sense , that they do take into account the pushed down run time filters.\r\n\r\nIn concrete Scan implementations, for eg iceberg's SparkBatchQueryScan , the equality check , apart from other things, also involves Runtime Filters pushed ( which is correct).\r\n\r\nBelow is description of how this issue surfaces.\r\nFor a given stage being materialized, just before materialization starts, the run time filters are confined to the BatchScanExec level.\r\nOnly when the actual RDD corresponding to the BatchScanExec, is being evaluated, do the runtime filters get pushed to the underlying Scan.\r\n\r\nNow if a new stage is created and it checks in the stageCache using its canonicalized plan to see if a stage can be reused, it fails to find the r-usable stage even if the stage exists, because the canonicalized spark plan present in the stage cache, has now the run time filters pushed to the Scan , so the incoming canonicalized spark plan does not match the key as their underlying scans differ . that is incoming spark plan's scan does not have runtime filters , while the canonicalized spark plan present as key in the stage cache has the scan with runtime filters pushed.\r\n\r\nThe fix as I have worked is to provide, two methods in the SupportsRuntimeV2Filtering interface ,\r\ndefault boolean equalToIgnoreRuntimeFilters(Scan other)\r\n\r\n{ return this.equals(other); }\r\ndefault int hashCodeIgnoreRuntimeFilters()\r\n\r\n{ return this.hashCode(); }\r\nIn the BatchScanExec, if the scan implements SupportsRuntimeV2Filtering, then instead of batch.equals, it should call scan.equalToIgnoreRuntimeFilters\r\n\r\nAnd the underlying Scan implementations should provide equality which excludes run time filters.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the hashCode of BatchScanExec, should use scan.hashCodeIgnoreRuntimeFilters instead of ( batch.hashCode).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. But the respective DataSourceV2Relations may need to augment their code.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded bug test for the same.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-11T20:31:11Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T20:50:24Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f5726b57e77ce08e102315778239493ae962a39f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49152/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49152/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49152/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/76cfbd53be567ea2793fc98a7834f217d75b90b0","head":{"label":"ahshahid:SPARK-45866","ref":"SPARK-45866","sha":"76cfbd53be567ea2793fc98a7834f217d75b90b0","user":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105594707,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU1OTQ3MDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"ahshahid/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe variantShreddingSchema method converts a human-readable schema for Variant to one that's a valid shredding schema. According to the shredding schema in https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/pull/461, each shredded field in an object should be a required group - i.e. a non-nullable struct. This PR fixes the variantShreddingSchema to mark that struct as non-nullable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf we use variantShreddingSchema to construct a schema for Parquet, the schema would be technically non-conformant with the spec by setting the group as optional. I don't think this should really matter to readers, but it would waste a bit of space in the Parquet file by adding an extra definition level.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this code is not used yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a test to do some minimal validation of the variantShreddingSchema function.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-12-11T20:12:24Z","updated_at":"2024-12-13T18:11:36Z","closed_at":"2024-12-13T18:11:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"584215fc0e7b42f1454cf5621bd7c80a1a0bf00a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49151/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49151/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49151/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/965b6a40967bbcf170ddaf9b4ab3f08bdc5dd73b","head":{"label":"cashmand:SPARK-48898-nullability-again","ref":"SPARK-48898-nullability-again","sha":"965b6a40967bbcf170ddaf9b4ab3f08bdc5dd73b","user":{"login":"cashmand","id":54722026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzIyMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54722026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand","html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":469837514,"node_id":"R_kgDOHAEmyg","name":"spark","full_name":"cashmand/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cashmand","id":54722026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzIyMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54722026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand","html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently the  CacheLookup relies on the fragment ( sub plan of incoming query)  matching exactly the analyzed Logical Plan in CacheManager for which InMemoryRelation exists.\r\nThis limits efficiency of the lookup.. for eg  \r\nconsider a simple case\r\nwe have an InMemoryRelation available for a plan as\r\n\r\n Project(a, b, c, d)                                                ->  Cached IMR\r\n      |\r\nProject( x as a, b,  b+a as c, b - c as d) \r\n\r\nand the incoming plan is say\r\n  Project( a, b, c)\r\n  |\r\nProject( x as a, b,  b+a as c, b - c as d) \r\n\r\nCurrently the incoming look up will not be able to use Cached IMR, as top level Projects do not match.\r\nBut it is possible to use the IMR by putting a projection of   (a, b c)\r\ni.e Project( a, b, c)\r\n         |\r\n    Cached IMR\r\n\r\nBelow describes how more complex plans can use cache IMR , with filters present in between Projects.\r\n**The main idea is : for each incoming fragment of incoming subplan, check if there is an exact match plan in the cache data. ( this is the current code).  If matches use that, else  look for a partial match ** \r\n\r\n** A partial match, among other requirements, also mandates that incoming_plan.child  is canonically same as cachePlan.child **\r\n\r\nIt can be argued that why only 1  level depth equality is needed, as it is possible that the cache plan is usable even if the child do not match, but grand child match.\r\n\r\n i.e incoming_plan.child.child == cachePlan.child .child\r\nand in that sense the argument can be extended to the leaf..\r\n\r\nSo we limit to 1 child level check for partial match for following reasons:\r\n1) Reduce the complexity \r\n2) Keep lookup time in reasonable limit\r\n3) Hopefully the next PR in line [PR-SPARK-45959](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/49124), which aggresively collapses two adjacents Projects or 2 Projects interspersed with Filters, into a single project in analyzer phase, if possible, means that in most cases, the child match would be good enough for partial match requirement..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCase 1: using InMemoryRelation in a plan having 2 consecutive Projects.\r\n\r\nWe start with a DataFrame df1 with plan = Project2 -> X\r\nand then we cache this df1. So that the CachedRepresentation has ( IMR and the logical Plan as Project2 -> X)\r\n\r\nNow we create a new data frame Df2 =  Some Project -> X \r\nClearly Project may no longer be same as Project2, so a direct check with CacheManager will not result in matching IMR.\r\nBut clearly X are same .\r\nSo the criteria is : an IMR can be used IFF following conditions are met\r\n\r\nX for both is same ( i.e incoming Project's child and CachedPlan's Project's child are same)\r\nAll the NamedExpressions of Incoming Project are expressable in terms of output of Project2 ( which is what IMR's output is )\r\nTo do the check for above point 2, we consider following logic\r\nNow given that X for both are same, which means their outputs are equivalent, so we remap the cached plan's Project2 in terms of output attribute ( Expr IDs) of X of incoming Project Plan\r\nThis will help us find out following\r\nThose NamedExpressions of incoming Project which are directly same as NamedExpressions of Project 2\r\nThose NamedExpressions of incoming Project which are some functions of output of Project 2\r\nThose NamedExpressions of incoming Project which are sort of Literal Constants and independent of output of Project2\r\nThose NamedExpressions of incoming Project which are functions of some attributes but those attributes are unavailable in the output of Project2\r\nSo so long as above # 4 types of NamedExpressions are empty, it means that InMemoryRelation of the CachedPlan is usable.\r\nand this above logic is coded in CacheManager. The logic involves modifying the NamedExpressions in incoming Project, in terms of the Seq[Attributes] which will be forced on the IMR.\r\n\r\nCase 2: using InMemoryRelation in a plan resulting from collapse of Projects interspersed with Filters.\r\n\r\nWe start with a DataFrame df1 with plan = Filter3 -> Filter4 -> Project2 -> X\r\nand then we cache this df1. So that the CachedRepresentation has ( IMR and the logical Plan as\r\nFilter3 -> Filter4 -> Project2 -> X )\r\n\r\nNow we create a new data frame Df2 = Project -> Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 -> Filter4  -> X \r\n\r\nClearly here the cached plan chain\r\nFilter3 -> Filter4 -> Project2 -> X\r\nis no longer directly similar to\r\nProject -> Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 - Filter4 - > X\r\nBut it is still possible to use IMR as actually the cached plan's LogicalPlan can be used as a subtree of the incoming Plan.\r\n\r\nThe logic for such check is partly the same as above for 2 consecutive Projects, with some handling for filters.\r\nThe algo for this is as follows\r\n\r\nIdentify the \"child\" X from the incoming plan and the Cached Plan 's Logical Plan. for similarity check.\r\nFor incoming Plan, we reach X, and store all the consecutive Filter Chain.\r\nFor the Cached Plan, we identify the first encountered Project , which is Project 2, and its child which is X.\r\n\r\nso we have X from both incoming and cached plan, and we identify the incoming project \"Project\" and the CachedPlan's \"Project2\".\r\nNow we can apply the Rule of case 1 of two consecutive Projects, and correctly modify the NamedExpressions of incoming Project , in terms of Seq[Attributes] which will be enforced upon the IMR.\r\n\r\nBut we also need to ensure that the filter chain present in Cached Plan i.e Filter3 -> Filter4 is a subset of filter chain in the incoming Plan , which is Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 - Filter4.\r\nNow thing to note is that\r\nfor incoming plan it is\r\nProject -> Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 - Filter4 - > X\r\nIn the above chain, the filters are expressed in terms of output of X\r\nBut for cached plan the filters are expressed in terms of output of Project2.\r\nFilter3 -> Filter4 -> Project2 -> X\r\n\r\nSo for comparison we need to express the filter chain of Cached Plan in terms of X, by pulling up the P2 above filters such that\r\nit is now\r\nProject2 -> Filter3' -> Filter4' -> -> X\r\n\r\nNow we can see that if we compare\r\nProject -> Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 - Filter4 - > X\r\n\r\nand find that Filter3' -> Filter4' is a subset of Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 - Filter4\r\nand as the Project and Project2 are already compatible ( by case point 1)\r\nwe can use cached IMR , with a modified Project with partial filter chain.\r\n\r\ni.e we should be able to get a plan like\r\n\r\nProject -> Filter1 -> Filter2 -> IMR.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR attempts to make cache look up more robust to make use of existing IMR as much as possible.\r\nAnd this change is a neccessary requirement for another opened PR which collapses projects aggresively [PR_SPARK-45959](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43854)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new tests and relying on existing tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-11T19:32:32Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T20:50:09Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49150/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49150/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49150/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5ff16c7245b553b412c891978019758447b36f59","head":{"label":"ahshahid:SPARK-47609","ref":"SPARK-47609","sha":"5ff16c7245b553b412c891978019758447b36f59","user":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105594707,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU1OTQ3MDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"ahshahid/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn this PR, I propose extending the current `DataSet` API and adding another `toJSON` method which will take a jsonOptions map parameter.\r\nThe full list of `jsonOptions` is documented in the dataSources page: https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.1/sql-data-sources-json.html, so the new added method can be used with all of the options specified in the docs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThese changes are needed because in some cases, users need to specify some options and more robustly control how the JSON strings will be formed from Dataset.\r\nOne example is when the output string has a timestamp:\r\nCurrently, the timestamp returned by `toJSON` method will have millisecond precision, but sometimes, users need better precision like micro. With appropriate option, users will be able to format the timestamp correctly.\r\n\r\nIn this case, user can call this new method with:\r\n`dataSet.toJSON(Map(\"timestampFormat\" -> \"dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS\"))` and get the desired precision.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. The change represents an extension for the `DataSet` API and allows users to call `toJSON` method with `options` argument, specifying the custom options for formatting the returned json.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThis patch was tested by adding a test in `JsonSuite`. There are a lot of tests that are testing `toJSON` method without arguments, but test was added for `toJSON` method with `options` argument, and they test that the date and timestamp accordingly to the format specified in the `jsonOptions` specified argument.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-12-11T16:44:25Z","updated_at":"2024-12-17T13:57:34Z","closed_at":"2024-12-17T13:57:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"242963231e0a1da2d3af0c3c242dbec1821d7831","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49148/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49148/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49148/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4d459ec4c3e0998fa89145364533f00e2186cdba","head":{"label":"vladanvasi-db:vladanvasi-db/dataset-api-extension","ref":"vladanvasi-db/dataset-api-extension","sha":"4d459ec4c3e0998fa89145364533f00e2186cdba","user":{"login":"vladanvasi-db","id":177719017,"node_id":"U_kgDOCpfG6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177719017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db","html_url":"https://github.com/vladanvasi-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/events{/privacy}","received_events

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdding proper support for implicit casting of subqueries in collation type coercion. Currently I only added support for `Project` and `Aggregate` plans in subquery expression, but we might need to add more later.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSince `SubqueryExpression` is a special type of expression it is not possible to just cast it into a different type, and this was causing a runtime error. Instead we need to go inside of its plan and cast the plan outputs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-11T13:55:59Z","updated_at":"2024-12-13T19:32:15Z","closed_at":"2024-12-13T19:32:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"78ca82f7b9b8b85e97086fc1de85823ef6fdb12a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49147/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49147/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49147/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/416461dc311dd01e0e1e56cfa584748d11506616","head":{"label":"stefankandic:fixSubquery","ref":"fixSubquery","sha":"416461dc311dd01e0e1e56cfa584748d11506616","user":{"login":"stefankandic","id":154237371,"node_id":"U_kgDOCTF5uw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154237371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic","html_url":"https://github.com/stefankandic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":734708961,"node_id":"R_kgDOK8rE4Q","name":"spark","full_name":"stefankandic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stefankandic","id":154237371,"node_id":"U_kgDOCTF5uw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154237371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic","html_url":"https://github.com/stefankandic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stefankandic/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the current version of Spark, its possible to use `MapType` as column for repartitioning. But `MapData` does not implement `equals` and `hashCode` (in according to [SPARK-9415](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-9415) and [[SPARK-16135][SQL] Remove hashCode and equals in ArrayBasedMapData](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13847)). Considering that, hash value for same Maps can be different.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to run `xxhash64` or `hash` function on `MapType`, ```org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.ExtendedAnalysisException: [DATATYPE_MISMATCH.HASH_MAP_TYPE] Cannot resolve \"xxhash64(value)\" due to data type mismatch: Input to the function `xxhash64` cannot contain elements of the \"MAP\" type. In Spark, same maps may have different hashcode, thus hash expressions are prohibited on \"MAP\" elements. To restore previous behavior set \"spark.sql.legacy.allowHashOnMapType\" to \"true\".;``` will be thrown. \r\n\r\nAlso, when trying to run `ds.distinct(col(\"value\"))`, where `value` has `MapType`, the following exception is thrown: ```org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.ExtendedAnalysisException: [UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE.SET_OPERATION_ON_MAP_TYPE] The feature is not supported: Cannot have MAP type columns in DataFrame which calls set operations (INTERSECT, EXCEPT, etc.), but the type of column `value` is \"MAP<INT, STRING>\".;```\r\n\r\nWith the above consideration, a new `InsertMapSortInRepartitionExpressions` `Rule[LogicalPlan]` was implemented to insert `mapsort` for every `MapType` in `RepartitionByExpression.partitionExpressions`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSupport `DESCRIBE TABLE ...  [AS JSON]` to optionally display table metadata in JSON format. \r\n\r\n**SQL Ref Spec:**\r\n\r\n{ DESC | DESCRIBE } [ TABLE ] [ EXTENDED | FORMATTED ] table_name { [ PARTITION clause ] | [ column_name ] } **[ AS JSON ]** \r\n\r\nOutput: \r\njson_metadata: String\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe Spark SQL command `DESCRIBE TABLE` displays table metadata in a DataFrame format geared toward human consumption. This format causes parsing challenges, e.g. if fields contain special characters or the format changes as new features are added. \r\nThe new `AS JSON` option would return the table metadata as a JSON string that supports parsing via machine, while being extensible with a minimized risk of breaking changes. It is not meant to be human-readable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, this provides a new option to display DESCRIBE TABLE metadata in JSON format.

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFix string schema for StatefulProcessorHandle, it was throwing an error before when passing the schema as String type because the utility method we used `_parse_datatype_string` requires a SparkContext which is not available on executors. \r\n\r\nThe way we support it is to create a new API `ParseStringSchema` from the client side (Python worker) to server side (JVM). Client passes a string schema to the server, we do the parsing on server side and then send the result back to the client.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is to fix an issue/bug with the existing code.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing test cases to include string schemas.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe basis of the change is to distinguish and resolve the ambiguity based on the Dataset from which column is extracted  by the user, instead of ExprIds.\r\nThat will result in a consistent and intuitive behaviour and also logically correct. \r\nCurrent code is mixing the resolution basis as sometimes using ExprId and sometimes indirectly using DataSet Id.\r\nThis PR used DataSet Id present in AttributeReference's metadata to see if ambiguity can be resolved logically / sensibly by checking with the DataSet ID's of the joining DataSets.\r\n\r\nThe PR attemps to fix the issue in following way\r\n\r\nIf the projection fields contain AttributeReference which are not found in the incoming AttributeSet, and the AttributeRef metadata contains the DatasetId info, then the AttributeRef is converted into a new UnresolvedAttributeWithTag and the original attributeRef is passed as paramter .\r\n\r\nIn the ColumnResolutionHelper, to resolve the UnresolvedAttributeRefWithTag, a new resolution logic is used:\r\nThe dataSetId from the original attribute ref's metadata is extracted.\r\n\r\nThe first BinaryNode contained in the LogicalPlan containing this unresolved attribute, is found.\r\nThen its right leg & left lag's unary nodes are checked for the presennce of DatasetID of attribute ref, using TreeNodeTag(\"__datasetid\").\r\nIf both the legs contain datasetId  and that too at same relative depth, or neither contains, then resolution exception is thrown\r\nElse the leg which contains datasetId is used to resolve.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhile fixing a bug where Ambiguous Column Exception was raised ( which worked fine in earlier versions of spark), came across multiple situations where a particular nested joined DataSet involving self joins, works, but fails when join order is changed or a column extract from dataset involved in join, is treated as unambiguous when used in join condition but same causes ambiguity exception when used in projection ( select)\r\nThere is also an existing test I believe which is falsely passing where resolution of attribute is not happening to the expected Dataset.\r\nFor eg:\r\n`\r\nval df1 = Seq((1, 2)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\")\r\nval df2 = Seq((1, 2)).toDF(\"aa\", \"bb\")\r\nval df1Joindf2 = df1.join(df2, df1(\"a\") === df2(\"aa\")).select(df1(\"a\"),\r\ndf2(\"aa\"), df1(\"b\"))\r\n\r\ndf1Joindf2.join(df1, df1Joindf2(\"a\") === df1(\"a\"))\r\n`\r\n\r\nThe above works fine, but below throws Exception. The only difference between the two is  that the latter has `select(df1(\"a\")`. But then `df1(\"a\")` works fine as a condition\r\n\r\n`\r\nval df1 = Seq((1, 2)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\")\r\nval df2 = Seq((1, 2)).toDF(\"aa\", \"bb\")\r\nval df1Joindf2 = df1.join(df2, df1(\"a\") === df2(\"aa\")).select(df1(\"a\"),\r\ndf2(\"aa\"), df1(\"b\"))\r\n\r\ndf1Joindf2.join(df1, df1Joindf2(\"a\") === df1(\"a\")).select(df1(\"a\"))\r\n`\r\n\r\nThere is an existing test in DataFrameSelfJoinSuite\r\n`\r\n  test(\"SPARK-28344: fail ambiguous self join - column ref in Project\") {\r\n    val df1 = spark.range(3)\r\n    val df2 = df1.filter($\"id\" > 0)\r\n\r\n    withSQLConf(\r\n      SQLConf.FAIL_AMBIGUOUS_SELF_JOIN_ENABLED.key -> \"false\",\r\n      SQLConf.CROSS_JOINS_ENABLED.key -> \"true\") {\r\n      // `df2(\"id\")` actually points to the column of `df1`.\r\n      checkAnswer(df1.join(df2).select(df2(\"id\")), Seq(0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2).map(Row(_)))\r\n\r\n      // Alias the dataframe and use qualified column names can fix ambiguous self-join.\r\n      val aliasedDf1 = df1.alias(\"left\")\r\n      val aliasedDf2 = df2.as(\"right\")\r\n      checkAnswer(\r\n        aliasedDf1.join(aliasedDf2).select($\"right.id\"),\r\n        Seq(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2).map(Row(_)))\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    withSQLConf(\r\n      SQLConf.FAIL_AMBIGUOUS_SELF_JOIN_ENABLED.key -> \"true\",\r\n      SQLConf.CROSS_JOINS_ENABLED.key -> \"true\") {\r\n     \r\n    // Assertion1  : existing \r\n     assertAmbiguousSelfJoin(df1.join(df2).select(df2(\"id\")))\r\n\r\n      // Assertion2 :  added by me\r\n      assertAmbiguousSelfJoin(df2.join(df1).select(df2(\"id\")))\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n`\r\nHere the **Assertion1** passes ( that is ambiguous exception is thrown)\r\nBut the  **Assertion2** fails ( that is no ambiguous exception is thrown)\r\nThe only chnage is the join order  \r\n\r\nLogically both the assertions are invalid ( In the sense both should **NOT** be throwing Exception as from the user's perspective there is no ambiguity.\r\nAnd this PR addresses it\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\nIt is possible that any Dataset involving self joins which may have  previously been throwing Ambiguity related exceptions are now expected to work , assuming the columns being extracted to be used in APIs are from DataSets being joined at the top most level.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new tests. Making stricter assertions. Modifying the existing tests in DataFrameSelfJoinTest which are logically having unambiguity based on datasets from which columns are extracted.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-12-11T00:13:55Z","updated_at":"2025-01-16T23:51:58Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49136/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49136/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49136/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/385e41239afe24bffb814b62b8b097d9d3ac6ae2","head":{"label":"ahshahid:SPARK-47320","ref":"SPARK-47320","sha":"385e41239afe24bffb814b62b8b097d9d3ac6ae2","user":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105594707,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU1OTQ3MDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"ahshahid/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid/spark","description":"Mirror

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThere is a small bug in Spark Connect's DataFrameWriter.\r\n\r\n ```\r\ndf.write.option(\"compression\", \"gzip\").parquet(path)\r\n```\r\nWhen this code is used, the specified compression option \"gzip\" gets overwritten by None. This happens because `parquet()` function has a default `compression=None` parameter which is used to set the compression option directly `with self.option(\"compression\", compression)`.\r\nThe Spark Connect server then receives a request without a specified compression option and instead uses the default \"snappy\" compression.\r\nThe fix is to use the `self._set_opts(compression=compression)`. This method of setting options is used by most other DataFrameWriter APIs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBug described above and repro is provided.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/commit/800faf0abfa368ad0a5ef1e0fa44b74dbaab724e frees column vector resources between batches in columnar to row conversion. However, like `WritableColumnVector`, `ConstantColumnVector` should not free resources between batches because the same data is used across batches\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout this change, ConstantColumnVectors with string values, for example, will fail if used with column->row conversion. For instance, reading a parquet table partitioned by a string column with multiple batches.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR attempts to keep the depth of the LogicalPlan tree unchanged,  when columns are added /dropped/renamed .\r\nThis is done via a special new rule called EarlyCollapseProject.\r\nThis is applied after the analysis has happened, but the analyzed plan is yet to be assigned to the holder variable in QueryExecution / DataFrame.\r\n\r\n**EarlyCollapseProject** code does the following :\r\n1) If  the incoming plan is a  project1 -> Project2 - X , then it collapses the two projects into one.  such that the final plan looks like Project -> X\r\n2) If the incoming plan is of the form  Project1 -Filter1 - Filter2 ---FilterN - Project 2 - X, then it collapses the Project1 and Project2 as \r\nProject -> Filter1 - Filter2 -- FilterN - X.\r\nPls note that in this case it is as if Project2 is pulled up for collapse, rather than vice versa.\r\nThe reason for this is that it is possible that Project1 has some behaviour ( like a UDF) which is not capable of handling certain data , which otherwise would be filtered by the filter chain.  If project1 was pushed below Filter chain, then the unfiltered rows can cause issues. Existing spark tests on UDF have test which is sensitive to this.\r\n\r\n3) The EarlyCollapseProject IS NOT applied if \r\n  a) any of the incoming Project nodes ( Project1 or Project2) have tag LogicalPlan.PLAN_ID_TAG set ( which implies it is coming from a spark client. It is not handled as of now, because for clients the subsequent resolutions are tied to a direct mapping of the tag ID associated with each Project, and removal of any Project via collapse , breaks the code)\r\n \r\nb) If the incoming Project2  has any UserDefinedExpression or non deterministic expression. Or If Project2's child is a Window node.\r\nThe reason for non-deterministic exclusion is to ensure the functionality is not broken, as collapse project  will replicate the non-deterministic expression. Similarly for UserDefinedExpression and Window node below Project2, the collapse is avoided, as it can cause replication & hence re-evaluation of expensive code when collapsed.\r\n\r\n4) The other important thing the EarlyCollapseProject does, is to store the attributes in the Collapsed Project node, which get dropped and because of collapse , they loose their presence from the Plan completely. \r\nThis is needed so as to resurrect dropped attributes, if needed arises, so as to do the resolution correctly.\r\nThe dropped attributes are stored in a Seq using the tag LogicalPlan.DROPPED_NAMED_EXPRESSIONS\r\nThe need for this arises in following situations:\r\nsay we start with a DataFrame df1 , with plan as  Project2 ( a, b, c)  - X\r\nthen we create a new DataFrame df2 = df1.select( b, c).  Here, attribute a is dropped\r\nBecause of the EarlyCollapseProject rule, the new DataFrame df2 , will have logical plan as Project(b, c) - X\r\nNow spark allows a DataFrame df3 = df2.filter( a > 7). \r\nwhich would result in a LogicalPlan as  Filter( a > 7) -> Project(b, c) -> X\r\nBut because \"a\" has been dropped , its resolution is no longer possible.\r\nTo retain the existing behaviour and hence resolution, the Project(b, c) contains the dropped the NamedExpression \"a\" , and hence this can be revived as last effort for resolution.\r\n\r\n**ColumnResolutionHelper** code change:\r\nThe reviving of dropped attributes for plan resolution is done via the code change in ColumnResolutionHelper.resolveExprsAndAddMissingAttrs, where the dropped attributes stored in the Tag are revived back for resolution.\r\n\r\nCode changes in **CacheManager**\r\nThe major code  change  is in **CacheManager**. \r\nPreviously as any change in projection ( addition, drop, rename, shuffling) resulted in a new Project , it was straightforward to lookup cache for fragment logical plan match, as the plan cached would always match a query subtree , if the subtree is used in an immutable form to build complete query tree.  But since in this PR , a new Project is collapsed with the existing Project, the subtree is no longer the same as what was cached. Apart from that, the presence of filters between two projects, also muddles the situation.\r\n\r\n**Case 1**: _using InMemoryRelation in a plan resulting from collapse of 2 consecutive Projects._\r\n\r\n We start with a  DataFrame df1 with plan = Project2  -> X\r\nand then we cache this df1. So that the CachedRepresentation has ( IMR and the logical Plan as Project2 -> X)\r\n\r\nNow we create a new data frame Df2 = df1.select ( some Proj)  , which due to early collapse would look like\r\n    Project -> X\r\nClearly Project may no longer be same as Project2, so a direct check with CacheManager will not result in matching IMR.\r\n But  clearly  X are same .\r\nSo the criteria is : an IMR can be used IFF following conditions are met\r\n1) X  for both is same ( i.e incoming Project's child and CachedPlan's Project's child are same)\r\n2) All the NamedExpressions of Incoming Project are expressable in terms of output of Project2  ( which is what IMR's output is )\r\n     To do the check for  above point  **_2_**, we consider following logic\r\n    Now given that X for both are same,  which means their outputs are equivalent, so we remap the cached plan's Project2 in terms  of output attribute ( Expr IDs) of X  of incoming Project Plan \r\n  This will help us find out following\r\n   1) Those NamedExpressions of incoming Project which are directly same as NamedExpressions of Project 2\r\n   2) Those NamedExpressions of incoming Project which are some functions of output of Project 2\r\n   3) Those NamedExpressions of incoming Project which are sort of Literal Constants and independent of output of Project2\r\n  4) Those NamedExpressions of incoming Project which are functions of some attributes but those attributes are unavailable in the  output of Project2\r\n\r\nSo so long as above # 4  types of NamedExpressions are empty, it means that InMemoryRelation of the CachedPlan is usable.\r\nand this above logic is coded in CacheManager. The logic involves modifying the NamedExpressions in incoming Project, in terms of the Seq[Attributes] which will be forced on the IMR.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Case 2**: _using InMemoryRelation in a plan resulting from collapse of Projects interspersed with Filters._\r\n\r\n We start with a  DataFrame df1 with plan = Filter3 -> Filter4 -> Project2  -> X\r\nand then we cache this df1. So that the CachedRepresentation has ( IMR and the logical Plan as\r\nFilter3 -> Filter4 ->  Project2 -> X )\r\n\r\nNow we create a new data frame Df2 = df1.filter( f2) .filter(f1).select (some Proj)  , which due to early collapse would look like\r\n  Project -> Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 - Filter4 - > X\r\n( this is because in case of filters, Project2 would be pulled up for collapse)\r\n\r\nClearly here the cached plan chain\r\nFilter3 -> Filter4 -> Project2  -> X\r\nis no longer directly similar to \r\nProject -> Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 - Filter4 - > X\r\nBut it is still possible to use IMR as actually the cached plan's LogicalPlan can be used as a subtree of the incoming Plan.\r\n\r\nThe logic for such check is partly the same as above for 2 consecutive Projects, with some handling for filters.\r\nThe algo for this is as follows\r\n1) Identify the \"child\"  X from the incoming plan  and the Cached Plan 's Logical Plan. for similarity check.\r\nFor incoming Plan, we reach  X, and store all the consecutive Filter Chain.\r\n\r\nFor the Cached Plan,  we identify the first encountered Project , which is Project 2, and its child which is X.\r\n\r\nso we have X from both incoming and cached plan, and we identify the incoming project \"Project\" and the CachedPlan's \"Project2\".\r\n Now we can apply the Rule of **case 1** of two consecutive Projects, and correctly modify the NamedExpressions of incoming Project , in terms of Seq[Attributes] which will be enforced upon the IMR.\r\n\r\nBut we also need to ensure that the filter chain present in Cached Plan i.e Filter3 -> Filter4  is a subset of filter chain in the incoming Plan , which is Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 - Filter4.\r\n**Now thing to note is that**\r\n  for incoming plan it is \r\nProject -> Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 - Filter4 - > X\r\nIn the above chain, the filters are expressed in terms of output of X\r\nBut for cached plan the filters are expressed in terms of output of Project2.\r\nFilter3 -> Filter4 -> Project2  -> X\r\n\r\nSo for comparison we need to express the filter chain of Cached Plan in terms of X, by pulling up the P2 above filters such that\r\nit is now \r\nProject2 -> Filter3' -> Filter4' -> -> X\r\n\r\nNow we can see that if  we compare \r\nProject -> Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 - Filter4 - > X\r\n\r\nand find that Filter3' -> Filter4'  is a subset of  Filter1 -> Filter2 -> Filter3 - Filter4  \r\nand as the Project and Project2 are already compatible ( by **case  point 1**)\r\nwe can use cached IMR , with a modified Project with partial filter chain.\r\n\r\ni.e we should be able to get a plan like\r\n\r\nProject -> Filter1 -> Filter2 -> IMR.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDue to addition/mods of new rules Spark 3.0 , clients are seeing extremely large increase in query compilation time, when the client code is adding one column at a time in a loop.  Even though API doc does not recommend such practice, but it happens and clients are reluctant to change the code. So this PR attempts to handle the situation where columns are added not in a single shot but  one at a time . This would help in Analyzer/ Resolver rules to complete faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new tests and relying on existing tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-12-10T04:49:11Z","updated_at":"2025-01-15T22:10:27Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49124/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49124/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49124/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8d77a4b046eafeb5a9d8da9a2b628b123a17582d","head":{"label":"ahshahid:SPARK-45959","ref":"SPARK-45959","sha":"8d77a4b046eafeb5a9d8da9a2b628b123a17582d","user":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105594707,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU1OTQ3MDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"ahshahid/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid/spark","description":"Mirror

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe `variantShreddingSchema` method converts a human-readable schema for Variant to one that's a valid shredding schema. According to the shredding schema in https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/pull/461, each shredded field in an object should be a required group - i.e. a non-nullable struct. This PR fixes the `variantShreddingSchema` to mark that struct as non-nullable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf we use `variantShreddingSchema` to construct a schema for Parquet, the schema would be technically non-conformant with the spec by setting the group as optional. I don't think this should really matter to readers, but it would waste a bit of space in the Parquet file by adding an extra definition level.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this code is not used yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a test to do some minimal validation of the `variantShreddingSchema` function.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

rule\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes new algorithm to create & store the constraints.\r\nIt tracks aliases in projection which eliminates the need of pessimistically generating all the permutations of a given constraint. It is also more effective in correctly identifying the filters which can be pruned , apart from minimizing the memory used as compared to the current code. This also has changes to push compound filters if the join condition is on multiple attributes and the constraint comprises of more than 1 attributes of the join conditions.\r\n\r\nPresently I have kept the code which retains the old logic of constraint management along with the new logic. It is controlled by the sql conf property spark.sql.optimizer.optimizedConstraintPropagation.enabled which is by default true. Once the PR is approved it would make sense to remove the old code & merge the code of ConstraintSet into ExpressionSet and removing some if else blocks in the Optimizer & the function Optimizer.getAllConstraints and LogicalPlan.getAllValidConstraints.\r\n\r\nThe new logic is as follows:\r\nIn the class ConstraintSet which extends ExpressionSet, we track the aliases , along with the base constraint.\r\nAny constraint which is added to the ConstraintSet is stored in the most canonicalized form (i.e consisting of only those attributes which are part of the output set and NOT the Alias's attribute).\r\n\r\nfor eg consider a hypothetical plan\r\n>            Filter( z > 10 && a1 + b2 > 10)\r\n                                 |\r\n>         Projection1 ( a, a as a1, a as a2, b , b as b1, b as b2, c, a +b as z)\r\n                                 |\r\n >                 Filter ( a + b > 10)\r\n                                 |\r\n >              base relation (a, b, c, d)\r\n\r\nAt the node Filter the constraint set will just have constraint a + b > 10\r\nAt the Node Projection1 , the constraint set will have\r\nconstraint a + b > 10\r\nand maintain following buffers\r\nbuff1 -> a , a1.attribute, a2. attribute\r\nbuff2 -> b, b1.attribute, b2.attribute\r\nbuff3 -> a + b, z.attribute\r\n\r\nconstraint a + b > 10 is already canonicalized in terms of output attributes.\r\n\r\nNow there are two filters on top of projection1\r\nFilter( z > 10) and Filter ( a1 + b2 > 10)\r\n\r\nTo prune the above two filters, we canonicalize z as a + b ( from the data maintained in the ConstraintSet) & check if the underlying set contains a +b > 10 & so can be pruned.\r\nFor Filter a1 + b2 > 10, we identify the buffer to which a1 & b2 belong to and replace it with 0th elements of the buffer, which will yield a +b > 10, and so filter can be pruned.\r\n\r\nNow suppose there is another Project2 ( a1, a2, b1, b2, z, c)\r\ni.e say attributes a & b are no longer part of OutputSet.\r\n\r\nsuch that the plan looks like:\r\n>         Projection2 ( a1,  a2,  b1,  b2, c,  z)\r\n                                |\r\n>            Filter( z > 10 && a1 + b2 > 10)\r\n                                 |\r\n>         Projection1 ( a, a as a1, a as a2, b , b as b1, b as b2, c, a +b as z)\r\n                                 |\r\n >                 Filter ( a + b > 10)\r\n                                 |\r\n >              base relation (a, b, c, d)\r\n\r\n**The idea is that \"as much as possible try to make a constraint survive.**\r\n\r\nSo in Project2 , the atttributes a & b are being eliminated.\r\nwe have a constraint a + b > 10 which is dependent on it.\r\nso in the ConstraintSet of the ProjectP2, we update it such that\r\nconstraint a + b > 10 becomes ----> a1 + b1 > 10\r\n**buff1   ->  a , a1, a2   will become --> a1, a2\r\nbuff2  ->  b , b1, b2.  will become  --> b1, b2\r\nbuff3   ->  a +b , z  will become  -->. a1 + b1 , z**\r\n\r\nThis way by tracking aliases & just storing the canonicalized base constraints we can eliminate the need of pessimistically generating all combination of constraints.\r\n\r\n**This PR also eliminates the need of EqualNullSafe constraints for the alias.\r\nIt also is able to handle the literal boolean constraints.**\r\n\r\n_**For inferring new Filter from constraints**_\r\nwe use following logic\r\nNew Filter = Filter.constraints -- ( Filter.child.constraints ++ Filter.constraints.convertToCanonicalizedIfRequired(Filter.conditions) )\r\nSo the idea is that new filter conditions without redundancy can be obtained by difference of current node's constraints & the child node's constraints & the condition itself properly canonicalized in terms of base attributes which will be part of the output set of filter node.\r\n\r\n_**For inferring new filters for Join push down,**_\r\n we identify all the equality conditions & then the attributes are segregated on the lines of LHS & RHS of joins. So to identify filters for push down on RHS side, we get all equality atttributes of LHS side & ask the ConstraintSet to return all the constraints which are subset of the passed LHS attributes. The LHS attributes are appropriately canonicalized & the ConstraintSet identified.\r\nOnce the constraints are know, we can replace the attributes with the corresponding RHS attributes. This helps in identifying the compound filters for push down & not just single attribute filters.\r\n\r\n_**Below is a description of the changes proposed.**_\r\n\r\nConstraintSet: This is the class which does the tracking of the aliases , stores the constraints in the canonicalized form, updates the constraints using available aliases if any of the attribute comprising constraint is getting eliminated. The contains method of this class is used for filter pruning. It also identifies those constraints which can generated new filters for push down in join nodes.\r\nRest all the changes are just to integrate the new logic as well as retain the old constraints logic.\r\nPls notice that related to tpcds plan stability , I had to add new golden files for q75. The change as such is trivial.\r\npreviously pushed filter was generated as\r\nPushedFilters: [IsNotNull(cr_order_number), IsNotNull(cr_item_sk)]\r\nand with the change it is\r\nPushedFilters: [IsNotNull(cr_item_sk), IsNotNull(cr_order_number)]\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. This issue if not fixed can cause OutOfMemory issue or unacceptable query compilation times.\r\nAdded a test **\"plan equivalence with case statements and performance comparison with benefit of more than 10x conservatively\"  in  org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.OptimizedConstraintPropagationSuite**. With this PR the compilation _**time is 247 ms vs 13958 ms without the change**_\r\n2. It is more effective in filter pruning as is evident in some of the tests in org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.OptimizedConstraintPropagationSuite where current code is not able to identify the redundant filter in some cases.\r\n3. It is able to generate a better optimized plan for join queries as it can push compound predicates.\r\n4. The current logic can miss a lot of possible cases of removing redundant predicates, as it fails to take into account if same attribute or its aliases are repeated multiple times in a complex expression.\r\n5. There are cases where some of the optimizer rules involving removal of redundant predicates fail to remove on the basis of constraint data. In some cases the rule works, just by the virtue of previous rules helping it out to cover the inaccuracy. That the ConstraintPropagation rule & its function of removal of redundant filters & addition of new inferred filters is dependent on the working of some of the other unrelated previous optimizer rules is behaving, is indicative of issues.\r\n6. It does away with all the EqualNullSafe constraints as this logic does not need those constraints to be created.\r\n7.  There is atleast one test in existing **ConstraintPropagationSuite** which is missing a IsNotNull constraints because the code incorrectly generated a EqualsNullSafeConstraint instead of EqualTo constraint, when using the existing Constraints code.  With these changes, the test correctly creates an EqualTo constraint, resulting in an inferred IsNotNull constraint\r\n8. It does away with the current combinatorial  logic of evaluation all the constraints can cause compilation to run into hours or cause OOM. The number of constraints stored is exactly the same as the number of filters encountered\r\n\r\n\r\nAdded a test suite **CompareNewAndOldConstraintsSuite** which when run on current master, will fail highlighting the issues with current master ( in terms of functionality) and also show the perf problem.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nMany new tests are added. All existing tests are passing cleanly.\r\nCode is functional in workday env. for 1.5 years  without any

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to lower `RowBasedKeyValueBatch.spill` warning message to debug level.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n   public final long spill(long size, MemoryConsumer trigger) throws IOException {\r\n-    logger.warn(\"Calling spill() on RowBasedKeyValueBatch. Will not spill but return 0.\");\r\n+    logger.debug(\"Calling spill() on RowBasedKeyValueBatch. Will not spill but return 0.\");\r\n     return 0;\r\n   }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAlthough Apache Spark has been showing a warning message since 2.1.0, there is nothing for a user to be able to do further. This is more like a dev-side debug message. So, we had better lower the level to `DEBUG` from `WARN`.\r\n- #14349\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo behavior change. This is a log message.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual review.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes to propagate the `isPredicate` info in `V2ExpressionBuilder` and wrap the children of CASE WHEN expression (only `Predicate`s) with `IIF(<>, 1, 0)` for MsSqlServer. This is done to force returning an int instead of a boolean, as SqlServer cannot handle boolean expressions as a return type in CASE WHEN.\r\n\r\nE.g.\r\n```CASE WHEN ... ELSE a = b END```\r\n\r\nOld behavior:\r\n```CASE WHEN ... ELSE a = b END = 1```\r\n\r\nNew behavior:\r\nSince in SqlServer a `= 1` is appended to the CASE WHEN, THEN and ELSE blocks must return an int. Therefore the final expression becomes:\r\n```CASE WHEN ... ELSE IIF(a = b, 1, 0) END = 1```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nA user cannot work with an MsSqlServer data with CASE WHEN clauses or IF clauses if they wish to return a boolean value.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to MsSqlServerIntegrationSuite\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCatch more cases where string type context should have implicit strength (lateral column aliases, outer references etc)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBefore we would only assign implicit strength when we encountered `AttributeReference` and `Alias`. However, this should be the case for all `NamedExpressions` and not just these two.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR implements `KVGDS.agg(typedColumn)` function when there is a `mapValues` function defined. This use case was previously unsupported (`mapValues` won't be applied).\r\n\r\nThis PR marks the special handling of `kvds.reduce()` obsolete. However, we keep the server-side code to maintain compatibility with older clients.\r\n\r\nThis implementation is purely done on the client side, oblivious to the Connect server. The mechanism is to first create an intermediate DF that contains only two Struct columns:\r\n```\r\ndf\r\n |- iv: struct<...schema of the original df...>\r\n |- v: struct<...schema of the output of the mapValues func...>\r\n```\r\nThen we re-write all grouping exprs to use `iv` column, and all aggregating exprs to use `v` column as input. The rule is as follows:\r\n\r\n- Prefix every column reference with `iv` or `v`, e.g., `col1` becomes `iv.col1`.\r\n- Rewrite `*` to\r\n  - `iv.value`, if the original df schema is a primitive type; or\r\n  - `iv`, if the original df schema is a struct type.\r\n\r\nFollow-up:\r\n\r\n- [SPARK-50837](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-50837): fix wrong output column names. This issue is caused by us manipulating DF schema.\r\n- [SPARK-50846](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-50846): consolidate aggregator-to-proto transformation code path.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo support a use case that is previously unsupported.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see the first section.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test cases.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-12-09T16:39:24Z","updated_at":"2025-02-06T21:18:51Z","closed_at":"2025-02-06T13:47:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7c7b404e4f0ac9ac9e24c71b7866f57a65380f52","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"vicennial","id":21010250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDEwMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21010250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial","html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49111/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49111/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49111/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e709623658737e165751b741ad878fe944d29ef4","head":{"label":"xupefei:kvds-mapvalues","ref":"kvds-mapvalues","sha":"e709623658737e165751b741ad878fe944d29ef4","user":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":777257207,"node_id":"R_kgDOLlQA9w","name":"spark","full_name":"xupefei/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR improves `dev/create-release/release-build.sh` by enabling 3-times retry for deploying artifacts to the Nexus staging repository\r\n\r\nWhen I was setting up 3.5.2-rc5 on my AWS EC2 instance, I encountered an issue with closing the `orgapachespark-1461` due to a timeout while uploading a sha1 file.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n

`orgapachespark-1462`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo avoid temporary network errors when performing the publish step for release managers.\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add a new configuration called `spark.api.mode` (default `classic`) that allows existing Spark Classic applications to easily use Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order users to easily try Spark Connect with their existing Spark Classic applications.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIt adds a new configuration `spark.api.mode` without changing the default behaviour.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nFor PySpark applications, added unittests for Spark Submissions in Yarn and Kubernates, and manual tests.\r\nFor Scala applications, it is difficult to add a test because SBT picks up the complied jars into the classpathes automatically (whereas we can easily control it for production environment).\r\n\r\nFor this case, I manually tested as below:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark-connect-example\r\ncd spark-connect-example\r\nbuild/sbt package\r\ncd ..\r\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/spark.git\r\ncd spark\r\nbuild/sbt package\r\n# sbin/start-connect-server.sh\r\nbin/spark-submit --name \"testApp\" --master \"local[*]\" --conf spark.api.mode=connect --class com.hyukjinkwon.SparkConnectExample ../spark-connect-example/target/scala-2.13/spark-connect-example_2.13-0.0.1.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-12-09T04:53:44Z","updated_at":"2025-02-07T03:53:38Z","closed_at":"2025-02-06T01:51:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"26892545d75dd5f0c51d138d7a41b54de9801b46","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49107/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49107/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49107/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/717a74a5e3e05ba3341f2d54e6a0845bd446b92f","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:api-mode-draft-3","ref":"api-mode-draft-3","sha":"717a74a5e3e05ba3341f2d54e6a0845bd446b92f","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`BlockMissingException` extends from `IOException`. When `BlockMissingException` occurs and ignoreCorruptFiles is enabled, the current task may not get any data and will be marked as successful([code](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0d045db8d15d0aeb0f54a1557fd360363e77ed42/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/FileScanRDD.scala#L271-L273)). This will cause data quality issues.\r\nGenerally speaking, `BlockMissingException` is a system issue, not a file corruption issue. Therefore, `BlockMissingException` should be thrown even if ignoreCorruptFiles is enabled.\r\n\r\nRelated error message:\r\n```\r\n24/11/29 01:56:00 WARN FileScanRDD: Skipped the rest of the content

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pull request updates how we handle non explicit collation mismatches. Currently, Spark throws an error for any collation mismatch. This change modifies that behavior by allowing expressions to work even if they don't know the collation of their inputs.\r\n\r\nHowever, if they try to fetch the collator or comparison/hash functions of the uknown (indeterminate) string type a runtime error will be raised.\r\n\r\nSince a runtime error is vague and not nice for the end users, I also added a list of expressions which are guaranteed to not work with indeterminate collation (binary comparison, string search etc) so that they can fail immediately in analysis and let the user know exactly where the problem is.\r\n\r\nFinally, last change is that we should never serialize any data with indeterminate collation, but we can show it back to the user, create views on top of it etc.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThrowing errors for all collation mismatches can break queries unnecessarily, especially for functions that don’t rely on collation (like concat). These functions combine strings without needing ordering rules, making collation enforcement unnecessary.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-12-07T04:45:11Z","updated_at":"2025-01-15T13:33:59Z","closed_at":"2025-01-15T13:33:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"342e0d8bb3a714fc768bd14dedabc81285c17247","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49103/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49103/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49103/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/284ca842e2c5007e85811e6baa78ac9a1b2b16ef","head":{"label":"stefankandic:indeterminateColl","ref":"indeterminateColl","sha":"284ca842e2c5007e85811e6baa78ac9a1b2b16ef","user":{"login":"stefankandic","id":154237371,"node_id":"U_kgDOCTF5uw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154237371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic","html_url":"https://github.com/stefankandic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":734708961,"node_id":"R_kgDOK8rE4Q","name":"spark","full_name":"stefankandic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stefankandic","id":154237371,"node_id":"U_kgDOCTF5uw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154237371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic","html_url":"https://github.com/stefankandic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stefankandic/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up to rename a new configuration to comply Apache Spark config namespace.\r\n- #48120\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `spark.sql.artifact.isolation.always.apply.classloader` config name introduces redundant namespace `spark.sql.artifact.isolation.always.*` and `spark.sql.artifact.isolation.always.apply.*`.\r\n```\r\n- spark.sql.artifact.isolation.always.apply.classloader\r\n+ spark.sql.artifact.isolation.alwaysApplyClassloader\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince we have

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR lifts read-only APIs of `SparkConf` into a new `ReadOnlySparkConf`. `SparkContext` now exposes a new read-only API to the conf through `SparkContext.getReadOnlyConf`, which can be used by clients outside the `spark` package if they require only read-only access. The new API avoids copying the entire (potentially large) conf as in `SparkContext.getConf`. This PR also changes all appropriate call sites to use the new API.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCloning the entire conf adds unnecessary CPU overhead due to copying, and GC overhead due to cleanup. Both affect tail latencies on certain workloads.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIt adds a new public API `SparkContext.getReadOnlyConf`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nIt is a refactoring PR, so we rely on existing tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSplit EncoderImplicits from SQLImplicits and provide helper object within StatefulProcessor to access underlying SQL Encoder related implicit functions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout this, we cannot handle the implicit encoder APIs on the executor. We would run into a NPE since the spark session is not available on the executors. One option is to pass the `SparkSession` or `SQLImplicits` directly to the `StatefulProcessor`. However, this risks exposing some methods relying on `SparkSession` again.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: Task 11 in stage 4.0 failed 4 times, most recent failure: Lost task 11.3 in stage 4.0 (TID 57) (10.68.181.194 executor 2): java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke \"org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession.implicits()\" because the return value of \"$line94e51c7e8a51415d827a613fcad00cc19.$read$$iw$$iw.spark()\" is null\r\n\tat $line94e51c7e8a51415d827a613fcad00cc152.$read$$iw$$iw$$iw$$iw$$iw$$iw$$iw$$iw$$iw$$iw$FruitCountStatefulProcessor.init(command-412580759966543:18)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.TransformWithStateExec.processDataWithInitialState(TransformWithStateExec.scala:732)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.TransformWithStateExec.$anonfun$doExecute$2(TransformWithStateExec.scala:625)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHence, we do 2 things:\r\n- split the encoder related functions that don't rely on `SparkSession` into a separate trait\r\n- expose a helper `implicits` object within the `StatefulProcessor` interface that users can import directly, providing access to only the necessary functions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] Run completed in 9

tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-06T21:01:23Z","updated_at":"2024-12-10T08:18:04Z","closed_at":"2024-12-10T08:18:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f4038669cfed567520076fe4984acdd183ed087d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

listTables API accepts `namespace`, not the pattern of schema\r\nBut JDBC Table Catalog use provided `namespace` parameter as schema pattern instead of a name.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Treat received namespace as schema name instead of schema pattern in `JDBCTableCatalog`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo align derived and base class API\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, users of DataSource V2 API for JDBC (probably not many users use it, since JDBC connectors still use RelationProvider for spark.read.format(\"jdbc\")) needs to provide schema name now instead of schema pattern.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nImagine you have next MySQL tables\r\n`my_schema.table1`\r\n`myyschema.table2`\r\n\r\nAnd you do next operation in Spark:\r\n```\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.catalog.myCatalog\", JDBCTableCatalog.getClass.getName)\r\nspark.sql(\"SHOW TABLES IN myCatalog.my_schema\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore (because provided name is not escaped, _ is any charcter):\r\n`my_schema.table1`\r\n`myyschema.table2`\r\n\r\nAfter (because we escaped characters):\r\n`my_schema.table1`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNo suitable tests exists, since change is simple, I did not introduce new tests\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-06T16:45:39Z","updated_at":"2024-12-12T00:49:08Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"59e215e035e5bdaee80362142bba50f7dcb6af45","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49095/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49095/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49095/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bee74aa7c11d1240d3db0ba2911d77a6496c7de6","head":{"label":"urosstan-db:align-JDBC-table-catalog-to-list-table-API","ref":"align-JDBC-table-catalog-to-list-table-API","sha":"bee74aa7c11d1240d3db0ba2911d77a6496c7de6","user":{"login":"urosstan-db","id":155642965,"node_id":"U_kgDOCUbsVQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155642965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db","html_url":"https://github.com/urosstan-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":750788282,"node_id":"R_kgDOLMAeug","name":"spark","full_name":"urosstan-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"urosstan-db","id":155642965,"node_id":"U_kgDOCUbsVQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155642965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db","html_url":"https://github.com/urosstan-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/urosstan-db/spark","description":"Apache

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen concurrent Spark jobs share the same skippable stage and stage state is changed from PENDING to SKIPPED at first job completition we increase skippedStages and skippedTasks attribute of current job. These attributes need to be modified for all jobs sharing that state to have a consistent data in AppStatusListener and later on the UI.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWithout this change only first job would know about the skipped stage and its skipped tasks. Others would show incomplete stage data and tasks progress bar.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`BlockMissingException` extends from `IOException`. When `BlockMissingException` occurs and ignoreCorruptFiles is enabled, the current task may not get any data and will be marked as successful([code](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0d045db8d15d0aeb0f54a1557fd360363e77ed42/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/FileScanRDD.scala#L271-L273)). This will cause data quality issues.\r\nGenerally speaking, `BlockMissingException` is a system issue, not a file corruption issue. Therefore, `BlockMissingException` should be thrown even if ignoreCorruptFiles is enabled.\r\n\r\nRelated error message:\r\n```\r\n24/11/29 01:56:00 WARN FileScanRDD: Skipped the rest of the content

For CREATE commands, this refers to all the underlying columns added as part of the table/view creation. For ALTER TABLE command, this refers to only newly created columns in the future, whereas existing ones are not affected, i.e. their collation remains the same.\r\n\r\nThe PR has been modelled after the original changes made by @stefankandic in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48090, with this PR covering table and view-level collations, whereas a follow up PR will be made covering schema-level collations.\r\n\r\nThis PR is adding/extending the corresponding DDL commands for specifying table/view level collation, whereas a follow up PR will be created separately to leverage the table/view collation in order to determine default collations for input queries of DML commands.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFrom our internal users feedback, many people would like to be able to specify collation for their objects, instead of each individual columns. This change adds support for table and view level collations, whereas subsequent changes will add support for other objects such as schema-level collations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe change follows the agreed additions in syntax for collation support.\r\n\r\nThe following syntax is now supported (**bold** parts denote additions):\r\n\r\n{ { [CREATE OR] REPLACE TABLE | CREATE [EXTERNAL] TABLE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] }\r\n  table_name\r\n  [ table_specification ]\r\n  [ USING data_source ]\r\n  [ table_clauses ]\r\n  [ AS query ] }\r\n\r\ntable_specification\r\n  ( { column_identifier column_type [ column_properties ] ] } [, ...]\r\n    [ , table_constraint ] [...] )\r\n\r\ntable_clauses\r\n  { OPTIONS clause |\r\n    PARTITIONED BY clause |\r\n    CLUSTER BY clause |\r\n    clustered_by_clause |\r\n    LOCATION path [ WITH ( CREDENTIAL credential_name ) ] |\r\n    COMMENT table_comment |\r\n    TBLPROPERTIES clause |\r\n    **DEFAULT COLLATION table_collation_name |**\r\n    WITH { ROW FILTER clause } } [...]\r\n\r\n\r\nCREATE [ OR REPLACE ] [ TEMPORARY ] VIEW [ IF NOT EXISTS ] view_name\r\n    [ column_list ]\r\n    [ schema_binding |\r\n      COMMENT view_comment |\r\n      TBLPROPERTIES clause |\r\n      **DEFAULT COLLATION collation_name** ] [...]\r\n    AS query\r\n\r\n\r\nALTER TABLE table_name\r\n   { ADD COLUMN clause |\r\n     ALTER COLUMN clause |\r\n     DROP COLUMN clause |\r\n     RENAME COLUMN clause |\r\n     **DEFAULT COLLATION clause | …**\r\n   }\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTests for the new syntax/functionality were added as part of the change. Also, some of the existing tests were extended/amended to cover the new DEFAULT COLLATION for table/view objects.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-06T03:19:41Z","updated_at":"2024-12-26T09:05:32Z","closed_at":"2024-12-26T09:05:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"75f632f0aca773e7007f7d7967b36c27aa451563","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, repartition by Variant producing expressions wasn't blocked during analysis. It should be blocked because Variant equality is not defined. It is similar to [this PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48909) which blocked Variant from Set operations.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nVariant equality is not defined yet and therefore shouldn't be allowed in repartitioning.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, prior to this PR, Variants repartition did not throw a well defined error.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR enables SQL pipe syntax by default by updating the default value of the `spark.sql.operatorPipeSyntaxEnabled` configuration from `Utils.isTesting` to `true`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis feature is ready for general usage. It is fully backwards-compatible, and will cause no breaking changes to existing SQL queries.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR also cleans up a unit test by removing the assignment of that configuration to true, since that is the default value now.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

This leads to improved performance for such jobs as we can eliminate at least one serialization round trip.\r\n\r\nConsider the following code\r\n```\r\nval ds1 = spark.createDataset(Seq((1,2)))\r\nval ds2 = sc.parallelize(Seq((1,2))).toDS().filter(_._1 > 1)\r\nds1.union(ds2).map(identity).explain()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this change it would have the plan\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(2) SerializeFromObject [knownnotnull(assertnotnull(input[0, scala.Tuple2, true]))._1 AS _1#25, knownnotnull(assertnotnull(input[0, scala.Tuple2, true]))._2 AS _2#26]\r\n+- *(2) MapElements $line14.$read$$iw$$Lambda$2763/0x00007feb249624d8@228b0159, obj#24: scala.Tuple2\r\n   +- *(2) DeserializeToObject newInstance(class scala.Tuple2), obj#23: scala.Tuple2\r\n      +- Union\r\n         :- LocalTableScan [_1#2, _2#3]\r\n         +- *(1) SerializeFromObject [knownnotnull(assertnotnull(input[0, scala.Tuple2, true]))._1 AS _1#10, knownnotnull(assertnotnull(input[0, scala.Tuple2, true]))._2 AS _2#11]\r\n            +- *(1) Filter $line14.$read$$iw$$Lambda$2736/0x00007feb24962110@34b312d8.apply\r\n               +- Scan[obj#9]\r\n```\r\nand after this change it becomes\r\n```\r\n == Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) SerializeFromObject [invoke(knownnotnull(assertnotnull(input[0, scala.Tuple2, true]))._1()) AS _1#43, invoke(knownnotnull(assertnotnull(input[0, scala.Tuple2, true]))._2()) AS _2#44]\r\n+- *(1) MapElements $line14.$read$$iw$$Lambda$2939/0x00007fc758b43570@3ab48325, obj#40: scala.Tuple2\r\n   +- Union\r\n      :- DeserializeToObject newInstance(class scala.Tuple2), obj#50: scala.Tuple2\r\n      :  +- LocalTableScan [_1#2, _2#3]\r\n      +- Filter (isnotnull(obj#11) AND invoke($line13.$read$$iw$$Lambda$2908/0x00007fc758b42530@f3a4502.apply(obj#11))\r\n         +- Scan[obj#11]\r\n```\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR updates cross-spawn from 7.0.3 to 7.0.6.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRecently, `./dev/lint-js` shows a warning like as follows.\r\n```\r\n1 high severity vulnerability\r\n\r\nTo address all issues, run:\r\n  npm audit fix\r\n\r\nRun `npm audit` for details.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can see the same message in CI.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/12183892848/job/33986553884#step:24:20\r\n\r\nTo inspect more, I executed `npm audit` and the result is:\r\n```\r\ncross-spawn  7.0.0 - 7.0.4\r\nSeverity: high\r\nRegular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in cross-spawn - https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3xgq-45jj-v275\r\nfix available via `npm audit fix`\r\nnode_modules/cross-spawn\r\n\r\n1 high severity vulnerability\r\n```\r\n\r\n`cross-spawn` is a dependency for the linter but the linter reports the issue as `high severity vulnerability` so let's fix it just in case.\r\nThis change is done by `npm audit fix` as the warning indicates.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n`./dev/lint-js` doesn't show the warning.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd proper support and tests for finding the collation context of cast expressions, especially on complex types.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n#48936 introduced a way for handling collation type coercion in complex types, however I didn't think about casting, which should be special cased when searching for the collation context of an expression. This means that currently collation context could return the type which is not the target type of the cast, and that is just incorrect.\r\n\r\nAlso we should be able to use casts to change collation of complex types (arrays, maps, structs), and since we can't just use `collate` clause on complex types we should assign IMPLICIT strength to user defined casts on complex types. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBackport of the https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48144\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the pushdown of ^ operator (XOR operator) for Postgres. Those two databases use this as exponent, rather then bitwise xor.\r\n\r\nFix is consisted of overriding the SQLExpressionBuilder to replace the '^' character with '#'.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nResult is incorrect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. The user will now have a proper translation of the ^ operator.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

PR depends on https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48989\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere is a bug in SQL scripting which causes empty compound statements to throw an error if their body consists solely of empty BEGIN END blocks. Examples:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWHILE 1 = 1 DO\r\n  BEGIN\r\n  END;\r\nEND WHILE;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nBEGIN\r\n  BEGIN\r\n    BEGIN\r\n    END;\r\n  END;\r\nEND;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by introducing a NO-OP statement for SQL scripting, which empty BEGIN END blocks will return.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrenty, compound bodies declare they have the next element even if their body is consisted only of empty blocks. This is because it only checks for existence of statements in the body, not whether there is at least one statement which is not an empty block.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests were added to existing suites.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nPer comment from another PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48355#discussion_r1868853316\r\nAdd a new compatibility test. This test verifies the following scenario:\r\nA Spark running under version 3.5 trying to read a commit log generated with the new changelog change but under V1.\r\nThen the commit log would look like: \r\n```\r\n{\"nextBatchWatermarkMs\":1,\"stateUniqueIds\":{}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in Spark 3.5 and before, there is no such `stateUniqueIds` field, so we need to make sure queries won't throw error in such cases. \r\n\r\nIn the new test, I create a `CommitMetadataLegacy` that only has `nextBatchWatermarkMs` and no `stateUniqueIds`, to read from a commit log as above. This simulates the scenario stated above, and the test passed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMore testing\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTest only addition\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds support for ConfigEntry to the RuntimeConfig interface. This was removed in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47980.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis functionality is used a lot by Spark libraries. Removing them caused friction, and adding them does not pollute the RuntimeConfig interface.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. This is developer API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI have added tests cases for Connect and Classic.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

one uses replaceWithChildren, one has to be careful with Generate plan nodes. Generate contains a list unrequiredChildIndex of unneeded child outputs in the Generate output. This data has to be adjusted accordingly. Otherwise an incorrect plan may be generated during optimisation. Here is an example (tested with Spark 3.5.3):\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\n\r\nsession= SparkSession.builder.master(\"local\").getOrCreate()\r\n\r\nsession.sql(\"\"\"\r\nselect\r\n    named_struct(\r\n          'b', '',\r\n          'c', '',\r\n          'd', array(named_struct('f', '', 'g', '')),\r\n          'e', ''\r\n    ) as a\r\n\"\"\").write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(\"tmp\")\r\n\r\ndf= session.read.parquet(\"tmp\")\r\ndf.createOrReplaceTempView(\"tmp\")\r\n\r\nsql=\"\"\"\r\nSELECT\r\na.b f1, a.c f2, x.f,\r\nSTACK(1, y) as (z)\r\nFROM tmp\r\nLATERAL VIEW POSEXPLODE_OUTER(a.d) as y, x\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nsession.sql(sql).explain()\r\n\r\n#== Physical Plan ==                                                             \r\n#*(1) !Project [_extract_b#21 AS f1#5, _extract_c#19 AS f2#6, _extract_f#20 AS f#12, z#13]\r\n#+- *(1) Generate stack(1, y#8), [_extract_b#21, _extract_f#20], false, [z#13]\r\n#   +- *(1) Project [_extract_b#21, y#8, x#9 AS _extract_f#20]\r\n#      +- *(1) Generate posexplode(_extract_f#26), [_extract_b#21], true, [y#8, x#9]\r\n#         +- *(1) Project [a#3.b AS _extract_b#21, a#3.d.f AS _extract_f#26]\r\n#            +- *(1) ColumnarToRow\r\n#               +- FileScan parquet [a#3] Batched: true, DataFilters: [], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex(1 paths)[file:/home/pa/test/spark-bug/tmp], PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<a:struct<b:string,d:array<struct<f:string>>>>\r\n\r\nsession.sql(sql).show()\r\n\r\n# java.lang.IllegalStateException: Couldn't find _extract_c#54 in [_extract_b#56,_extract_f#55,z#36]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nOne can see, that the generated plan is invalid (_extract_c_#19 is missing in the in previous Project) and yields an error during execution. With this fix, the problem does not

If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd so that a python dict can be typed as RowLike \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn the examples for creating a pyspark dataframe using spark.createDataFrame there is an example code snippet for passing a list of dicts:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3d063a01d7c2a6d9613e11dec882739daa7eeb71/python/pyspark/sql/session.py#L1404-L1412\r\n\r\nThough in the typing of this method it accepts an iterable of \"RowLike\" objects\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3d063a01d7c2a6d9613e11dec882739daa7eeb71/python/pyspark/sql/session.py#L1245-L1251\r\n\r\nWhere a dict is not a RowLike object\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3d063a01d7c2a6d9613e11dec882739daa7eeb71/python/pyspark/sql/_typing.pyi#L60\r\n\r\nCreating a dataframe from a list of dicts works fine, but the typing of it doesn't (using mypy)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, users would correctly test for typings when passing a list of dicts in the createDataFrame method. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, users would get\r\n\r\n`error: Value of type variable \"RowLike\" of \"createDataFrame\" of \"SparkSession\" cannot be \"dict[str, Any]\"  [type-var]`\r\n\r\nwhen using mypy for static type checking the following code snippet\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\n\r\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"SimpleApp\").getOrCreate()\r\n\r\nd = [{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 1}]\r\nspark.createDataFrame(d).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhile the expected result would be \r\n\r\n`Success: no issues found in 1 source file`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nHaven't setup a local environment for testing the repo. Can do this if I get a heads up that I am on the right track.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the
