DESCRIBE WHAT THIS PR DOES. -->\r\n\r\nProvide option `series-candlestick.itemStyle.borderColorDoji` to set custom doji color.\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n#11042\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\n<!-- DESCRIBE THE BUG OR REQUIREMENT HERE. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE. -->\r\n\r\nDoji means the open and close value of a data item is the same. Previously, it can either be `borderColor` or `borderColor0` according to the previous data item. But if developers want to change it to a custom color, like a neutral colour like gary, it cannot be done.\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nSo in this PR, we provide a new option `borderColorDoji`. If it is set, this color is used for all doji data items.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR doesn't relate to document changes\r\n- [

Please fill in the following information to help us review your PR more efficiently. -->\r\n\r\n## Brief Information\r\n\r\nMultiple level drill down support for the [universalTransition](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#series-bar.universalTransition) feature.\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [ ] bug fixing\r\n- [x] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nIn this PR, a new property `childGroupId` [comes up](https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/16152#issuecomment-1207182380) and together with `groupId`, they can build multiple \"parent-child\" relationships between options.  The old way of only using `groupId` to implement a one-level drilldown and other animations still works. I have reviewed all test cases related to universalTransition and everything remains fine because **the new API does not bring any breaking change**.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to decide whether `groupId` or `childGroupId` is used as key in the keyGetter funtion to make sure that universalTransition animation does right, so I figured out a way to handle this, please see the[ block comments](https://github.com/tyn1998/echarts/blob/ce89ee778d03b4d4099c601a44f9a52cd2cb74a5/src/animation/universalTransition.ts#L254-L293) in code.\r\n\r\nA test html file is added to illustrate how to use `childGroupId` with `groupId` to implement the effect of multiple level down drill.\r\n\r\nAlso fixed #17309 by the way, so #17559 can be closed if this PR is merged (I just cherry picked the commit in that PR to this branch).\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n- #16152\r\n- #17309\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\n<!-- DESCRIBE THE BUG OR REQUIREMENT HERE. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE. -->\r\n\r\nOnly 1 level drill down is allowed.\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\n<!-- THE RESULT AFTER FIXING AND A SIMPLE EXPLANATION ABOUT HOW IT IS FIXED. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE. -->\r\n\r\nMultiple level drill down is

type of:\r\n\r\n- [ ] bug fixing\r\n- [x] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n<!-- USE ONE SENTENCE TO DESCRIBE WHAT THIS PR DOES. -->\r\nThis PR implements labels for all visible/plotted values of the box plot (this also includes the whiskers).\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nThe box plot now utilises the basics of the label option (i.e. `show`, `offset` and `formatter`) to display labels for the values of each box of the box plot.\r\n\r\nAs the multiple labels are not supported for single series items - the `setBoxLabels` method was added to the `BoxView`. In order to custom calculate the positions and add the labels to the plot.\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n- [x] This PR doesn't relate to document

Please fill in the following information to help us review your PR more efficiently. -->\r\n\r\n## Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [x] bug fixing\r\n- [ ] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\ndataGroupId for old data items in universalTransition is mistakenly set to that of new data items, not the expected old one. So fix it.\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n- Closes #17309\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/echarts/blob/89d57f21b7eabfcc6770447f6cf6a20a8f406585/src/animation/universalTransition.ts#L210\r\n\r\nWhen processing old data items, after executing this line, dataGroupId is wrongly assigned a value that is belong to new data items. That will cause universalTransition not work if we fall back to depend on dataGroupId to decide dataItem's key.\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nBy storing the old dataGroupId in globalStore, now the correct old dataGroupId can be accessed!\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR doesn't relate to document changes\r\n- [ ] The document should be updated later\r\n- [x] The document changes have been made in apache/echarts-doc#295\r\n\r\nI think [the example](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/zh/editor.html?c=bar-drilldown) should be updated with `dataGroupId` in `series` field.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32434520/186184210-29f4896a-99ff-4406-86a8-ed35199fded8.png)\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\n### ZRender Changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR depends on ZRender changes (ecomfe/zrender#xxx).\r\n\r\n### Related test cases or examples to use the new APIs\r\n\r\nN.A.\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\n### Merging options\r\n\r\n- [x] Please squash the commits into a single one when merging.\r\n\r\n### Other information\r\n\r\nThanks for @pissang's instruction!","created_at":"2022-08-23T14:28:56Z","updated_at":"2022-12-01T02:24:55Z","closed_at":"2022-10-15T13:33:48Z","merged_at":"2022-10-15T13:33:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"069b69295e3a65e16d9d2fbdef86a8d3bfc8023a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2184416954,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTg0NDE2OTU0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/labels/size/M","name":"size/M","color":"aaaaaa","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4226492785,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAIwqAM776ylx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/labels/PR:%20doc%20ready","name":"PR:

existing funnel style.\r\n- [x] Add a dynamic height prop\r\n \r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- #xxxx: ...\r\n-->\r\n#14863\r\n#16445\r\n#17566\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\nThe following is the current style of funnel diagram, and you can see that there is a lot of room to expand the function of funnel diagram such as flatten the top and so on.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103579791/188363325-8ce349a2-48e2-46bd-814a-d859769f700a.png)\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\nTo preserve the original style, the new style needs to be set with new options.\r\n1. If you want to flatten the top to represent none zero value, please set `exitWidth` as `100%`.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103579791/188363775-742112da-8d8b-4826-b7e2-4ced428c41fc.png)\r\n2. If you want data dynamic mapping on the height， please set `dynamicHeight` as `true`.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103579791/188364524-0e7014df-126a-4e57-95f6-9e7dc3d95e15.png)## Document Info\r\n3. If you want the previous funnel to be a little bit thicker, please set `minSize` as a percentage string between 0% and 100% such as `'33%'`.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103579791/188364986-3c85f794-b91d-4754-927d-bea05430a9ff.png)\r\n4. If you want to show the conversion rate between each of the data in Figure 1, please set `showRate` as true.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103579791/188365250-2d8f6513-b80a-4a6c-8201-2c2585104f17.png)\r\n5. If you want make the previous funnel last piece a trapezoidal, plese set `exitWidth`  as a percentage string between 0% and 100% such as `'33%'`.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103579791/188365603-26d85b87-d1e2-425b-801a-a05c54aff975.png)\r\n\r\n### More: New attribute explanation\r\n1. `exitWidth`, this property is to set the top width of the top funnel block, taking the bottom width of the piece as the base. Application scenarios: figure 1 and figure 5. Invalid when `dynamicArea` is valid;\r\n2. `dynamicHeight`, this property will let each data take it's funnel piece height.\r\n3. `thickDegree`, this property is control then thick degree of then dynamic height funnel, if you set this prop greater than 0% ,the funnel will thicker than default.\r\n4. `showRate`, this property will show rate pieces between each data, invalid when dynamicHeight or dynamicArea is true.\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR doesn't relate to document changes\r\n- [ ] The document should be updated later\r\n- [x] The document changes have been made in

feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n<!-- USE ONE SENTENCE TO DESCRIBE WHAT THIS PR DOES. -->\r\n\r\nApache ECharts uses [sub-pixel optimization](https://github.com/ecomfe/zrender/blob/master/src/graphic/helper/subPixelOptimize.ts) on horizontal and vertical axes (including splitLines, ticks, and minorTicks) so that these lines should be drawn only at the positions like `10px`, `10.5px`, `11px` for lines whose lineWidth is 1.\r\n\r\nBut for the case of bar-racing, this may cause the weried moving of split lines as reported in #14679 . So this PR disables sub-pixel optimization when in animation to solve the problem.\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n#14679\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the

feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nAllow legend icons to inherit style from series icon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n\r\n- fix #17350 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nAs is specified [here](https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/17350#issuecomment-1181271755), a judgement is only satisfied for LineSeriesModel, so icon style can only be inherited in line charts but not in scatter charts. This judgement is whether the model has the method `getLegendIcon()`.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14244944/178403998-73f6575a-b22e-4c91-b7ea-44d45876f826.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nThe way to solve this is simply add the same function `getLegendIcon()` to ScatterSeriesModel. It is not used in any other function by now so it's safe to add it just to allow icon style inheritance. But if we need to use this function for scatter model, further tests are needed.\r\n<img width=\"849\" alt=\"after #17350\"

Please fill in the following information to help us review your PR more efficiently. -->\r\n\r\n## Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [x] bug fixing\r\n- [ ] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nFix the cases when time axis labels and ticks being overlapped.\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n#17198\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nSome of the labels are too close to each other.\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\n#### Change 1. Labels with priority\r\n\r\nBefore: Labels with different levels (year/month/day/...) have the same priority. So even #15583 can help remove the labels when overlapped (BWT, it seems not always remove overlapped labels), more important information can be lost. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"649\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/779050/203246442-85e00454-4b37-494d-bb4b-19323a40a0c7.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter: Labels with larger level (e.g., year labels have larger levels than month labels) are displayed with higher priority and then display labels with smaller levels when there is enough space.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"660\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/779050/203246477-b7d53e56-7fdc-44bc-bfcd-0c2d8fef3504.png\">\r\n\r\n#### Change 2. A new option `axisLabel.formatterMinUnit`\r\n\r\nBefore: If a developer want to display year labels when zoomed out and day labels when zoomed in but never display hour/minute/... level labels, the only thing can be done is by setting `formatter` to be:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nformatter: {\r\n  hour: '{d}', // or set to be '' to hide labels but you cannot hide the ticks\r\n  minute: '{d}',\r\n  second: '{d}',\r\n  millisecond: '{d}'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not intuitive and it cannot help remove these ticks.\r\n\r\nAfter: By setting `axisLabel.formatterMinUnit` to be `'day'`, ticks with levels smaller than `'day'` will not be displayed.\r\n\r\n#### Change 3. Align `showMinLabel/showMaxLabel` logic with other types of axis\r\n\r\nBefore: The default value of `showMinLabel/showMaxLabel` of time axis is set to be `false` while other types axis is set to be `null` as the [document](https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#xAxis.axisLabel.showMinLabel) states:\r\n\r\n> It is auto determined by default, that is, if labels are overlapped, the label of the min tick will not be displayed.\r\n\r\n`showMinLabel/showMaxLabel` is set to be `false` by default because time axis may have min values like `2022-10-12 12:34:23 123`, which is formatted to be `12:34:23 123` and we don't expect the start/end values to be like this. Instead, developers may expect to display `2022-10-12` or `10-12`, etc.\r\n\r\nAfter: The default value of `showMinLabel/showMaxLabel` of time axis is set to be null and the first/last label is displayed when there is enough space. Since we now have `formatterMinUnit`, developers can easily set it to be `'day'` to hide it when its level is less than day level.\r\n\r\nAnother useful way to use it is to set `showMinLabel/showMaxLabel` to be `true` so that the first/last label should always be displayed. But don't worry. In this case, if the level of the label is less than `formatterMinUnit`, then the formatter of `formatterMinUnit` is used. For example, if we set `formatterMinUnit` to be `'day'` and the start label value is `2022-10-12 12:34:23 123`, then the formatter of day is used so it's formatted to be `10-12`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\naxisLabel: {\r\n  formatterMinUnit: 'day',\r\n  formatter: {\r\n    day: 'MMM-d'\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Change 4:\r\n\r\nBefore: `axisLabel.padding` is not considered when checking overlapping.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1427\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/779050/203251414-52ca6719-ccf6-40dc-9b9e-18f9882c25c5.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:

We just can scale it. And I wish that we can use the touchpad to move the dataZoom window.

`test/gesture.html` see the result.\r\n\r\nI added an option `gestureOnTouchPad`: \r\nUsers can set `gestureOnTouchPad` to `true`, that means we adjust the MAC touchpad.\r\n```\r\n\r\n

(ninevra)</li>\n<li>Fixed some bad cascade computation in <code>getComputedStyle()</code>. (romain-trotard)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 16.6.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>parentNode.replaceChildren()</code>. (<a href=\"https://github.com/ninevra\"><code>@​ninevra</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed jsdom's handling of when code running inside the jsdom throws <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code> as an exception. (<a href=\"https://github.com/mbest\"><code>@​mbest</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Removed the dependency on the deprecated <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/request\"><code>request</code></a> package, in the process fixing several issues with the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> implementation around header processing. Thanks go to <a href=\"https://github.com/tobyhinloopen\"><code>@​tobyhinloopen</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/andrewaylett\"><code>@​andrewaylett</code></a>, and especially <a href=\"https://github.com/vegardbb\"><code>@​vegardbb</code></a>, for completing this months-long effort!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 16.5.3</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed infinite recursion when using <code>MutationObserver</code>s to observe elements inside a <code>MutationObserver</code> callback.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 16.5.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed <code>Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *</code> to work with <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>.

feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n<!-- USE ONE SENTENCE TO DESCRIBE WHAT THIS PR DOES. -->\r\nFix the error that occurs when declaring area with x/y in `markArea`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n\r\n- #5832\r\n- #7055\r\n- #10074\r\n- fix #17344\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nAs is described in issues, when setting x and y to denote an area for `markArea`, the error occurs. This is caused becasue `lt` and `rb` returned by `dataTransform()` has no attribute `coord` when user does not specify `coord` in `markArea.data`. So when running the following code, Echarts reads `lt.coord` and throw an error.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/echarts/blob/11a9247e7fab2e6ff9c60b545ba775e8c1b2412f/src/component/marker/MarkAreaView.ts#L69-L79\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14244944/173723997-ebc8e78e-4a1a-4e2f-9a27-3f9b6a9605b6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nNow before `dataTransform()` return an `item`, a check is added and make sure there's a `coord` attribute in it (even `coord` is not needed). And there will be no errors caused by this.\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n\r\n- [x] This PR doesn't relate to document changes\r\n- [ ] The document should

Please fill in the following information to help us review your PR more efficiently. -->\r\n\r\n## Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [ ] bug fixing\r\n- [ ] new feature\r\n- [x] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n<!-- USE ONE SENTENCE TO DESCRIBE WHAT THIS PR DOES. -->\r\n\r\nImprove the PR template so that doc can always under control for

requests in a certain release to check whether there should be document changes and whether they have been made into the `echarts-doc` repo. Sometimes it's hard for the release manager to know the detail of all PRs so it's not always an easy job to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How is it fixed in this PR?\r\n\r\nSo I decide to improve the workflow so that:\r\n\r\n- The author of a PR is mainly responsible to decide whether a PR requires document changes and whether a PR in `echarts-doc` repo has been made. This is done by editing the description of the PR.\r\n- The reviews of the PR should check this info before merging.\r\n\r\nThe [Apache ECharts bot](https://github.com/apps/echarts-bot) is recently under debugging for this feature. It should add one of `PR: doc unchanged`, `PR: doc awaiting`, `PR: doc ready` to the PR based on the description. It will also give a warning if none of the three checks are made when a PR is opened and when a reviewer approves it.\r\n\r\nI will also look into if we can made checking labels to be a prerequisite before merging.\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\n<!-- ADD RELATED ISSUE ID WHEN APPLICABLE -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] The API has been changed (apache/echarts-doc#xxx).\r\n- [ ] This PR depends on ZRender changes (ecomfe/zrender#xxx).\r\n\r\n### Related test cases or examples to use the new APIs\r\n\r\nN.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\n### Merging options\r\n\r\n- [ ] Please squash the commits into a single one when merging.\r\n\r\n### Other
