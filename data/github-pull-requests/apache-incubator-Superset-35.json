SUMMARY\r\nCurrently, there is a lot of discrepancy between how list views look/work:\r\n- The \"Search\" filter is sometimes first or last. It is also sometimes called \"Name\".\r\n- The ordering of the other filters is highly inconsistent, and not in line with the column ordering.\r\n- The first column is sometimes \"Name\", other times the asset type, e.g. \"Dashboard\".\r\n- The Owners column is missing on Charts page.\r\n- The modified column is sometimes called \"Modified\", other times \"Last modified\"\r\n- We sometimes have the \"Created by\" and \"Created on\" columns, but usually not.\r\n\r\nIn addition, with the introduction of Tags, the list views have become very cluttered, raising the need for removing less relevant fields.\r\n\r\nThis makes the layout consistent across the following list views:\r\n- Annotation Layers\r\n- Dashboards\r\n- Charts\r\n- Datasets\r\n- Row Level Security\r\n- Databases\r\n- Tags\r\n- Alerts & Reports\r\n- CSS Templates\r\n- Saved Queries\r\n\r\nThe following changes are made:\r\n- The Search/Name filter is placed first. The filter name is set as \"Name\", as \"Search\" might indicate that it searches other fields, too.\r\n- Owners is added to all list views where relevant. This was missing on the Charts view.\r\n- The \"Created by\" and \"Created at\" fields are removed, as they're largely irrelevant.\r\n- The \"Modified by\" and \"Modified at\" fields are merged, so that the modifier is shown when hovering.\r\n- The \"Created by\" filter is replaced by \"Modified by\", to make it possible to search based on who last modified the asset.\r\n- The Filters are reordered to be in line with the column orders. This is with the exception of less commonly needed filters, like \"Favorite\" and \"Published\".\r\n- Single select filters are changed from plural to singular. This particularly affects the \"Tags\", \"Owners\" and \"Dashboards\" filters, which are now \"Tag\", \"Owner\" and \"Dashboard\" respectively. Note, that we may want to make these multi-select at some point, but that would require introducing an IN filter, either locally or in FAB.\r\n- The facepile on \"Tags\" is removed, as that should IMO only be used for Owners.\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOTS\r\n\r\n#### Charts\r\n<img width=\"1518\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/4eab78ff-1aaa-4b6b-98c2-77fdd636e392\">\r\n\r\n#### Dashboards\r\n<img width=\"1527\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/60fabd03-3b3c-42e7-9611-d604acbdb367\">\r\n\r\n#### Dataset\r\n<img width=\"1522\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/e89a3bf4-dec4-4378-8eef-9638393dc40a\">\r\n\r\n#### Saved Queries\r\n<img width=\"1528\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/268d588e-6a4d-4cbb-bb89-d246d43cd828\">\r\n\r\n#### Row Level Security\r\n<img width=\"1527\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/cfe0d562-4771-43e2-9516-80381edcc421\">\r\n\r\n#### Database\r\n<img width=\"1523\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/f8324d49-8a8e-4f21-bc96-9a47157be699\">\r\n\r\n#### CSS Templates\r\n<img width=\"1526\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/b5b599c5-4299-413e-b098-c8ff80db3caf\">\r\n\r\n#### Tags\r\n<img width=\"1524\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/31b304db-f985-4ebf-b15b-0c17d21d2472\">\r\n\r\n#### Alerts & Reports\r\n<img width=\"1527\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/b9196a42-a64c-4a8d-9ba3-040b47402a23\">\r\n\r\n#### Annotation Layers\r\n<img width=\"1528\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/1eb28695-f6bd-48fe-b732-1d773319e3d9\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nPass from_dttm and to_dttm as additional context to the dataset macro, allowing any jinja templating in the underlying dataset query text to refer to this context.\r\n\r\nThis is useful in situations where virtual dataset A incorporates from_dttm and/or to_dttm into the query, in order to make the underlying query aware of chart filter contexts, and then virtual dataset B is built on top of dataset A and used in charts.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### Before\r\n![before-no-dttm-ref](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/2862039/708ffe3f-0292-48ec-b143-673044e299a7)\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n![after-dttm-ref](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/2862039/ea53b15d-1948-45b9-b7d2-9e3b523eca3f)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nMake sure `ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PROCESSING` is turned on, and use a standard dev superset environment with the samples database available. You can also tweak these steps to use other data or backends as long as you apply a time filter in your dashboard.\r\n\r\n1. Using the samples database, run the following query in SQL Lab:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT ds, gender, name, num_boys, num_girls, '{{ from_dttm or \"empty\" }}' from_dttm FROM public.birth_names\r\n```\r\nand save it as a virtual dataset called `from_dttm`. Currently the `from_dttm` field will show `empty` because it won't be populated until a filter is applied on a chart in a later step.\r\n\r\n2. Create a table chart from this dataset, select all fields, and add a time filter on `ds`. Add this chart to a new dashboard, and configure a time filter for `ds` on that dashboard. Set that filter to the past 30 years so we can see some data. Notice that now `from_dttm` displays a datetime value.\r\n\r\n3. In SQL Lab again, run the following query:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM {{ dataset(25) }};\r\n```\r\nyou'll need to make sure `25` here is the ID of your virtual dataset `from_dttm` in step 1. Create a chart exactly like the first one, and add it to the same dashboard so you can see the two charts side by side.\r\n\r\n4. Compare the two tables and you will see `from_dttm` is correctly populated in both charts; prior to this change the second one, using the `dataset` macro, will show `empty` instead as it does not propagate sufficient context from the chart through the macro.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWe have a few examples in the codebase where for logging purposes we need to pass data down to parts of the codebase that have no need to know about this data. It creates very coupled and bloated modules that often are just passing data down without even acting on it. This change proposes the use of a global context dictionary that is used for read-only purposes for logging. \r\n\r\nThere are three places where we can use this functionality. One is an [open PR](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23114) that I wrote that helps us to log a report execution id to tie together multiple logs to the same report execution. \r\nAnother example is [passing report header data](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20903) to an smtp event for logging in a mail server.\r\nAnd the third use case is to pass [dashboard_id and chart_id](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/25192) into the sql mutator for logging. \r\n\r\nI have rewritten the first two examples each in one commit in this PR for diffing the implementations for each with a global context. I'll add how the third example (sql mutator) either in this PR or in a subsequent one. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nStarting from version 1.2.1, [SQLAlchemy Dremio](https://github.com/narendrans/sqlalchemy_dremio) has fixed the missing has_table function that is required in Superset. With version 2.0, it drops support for pyodbc and sets pyarrow flight as the default. Additionally, starting from version 3.0, the driver supports Dremio Cloud.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures backward compatibility by retaining pyodbc support.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nFollowing up #25282, rendering performance can still be improved by reducing unnecessary rerenders (also known as over-rendering).\r\nThis commit improves performance in four areas.\r\n\r\n#### 1. Inefficient uniqWith and object equality check in uniqueOptions\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/d6fde3cdd5987e3bf9a37d1fcde2dc82ef695747/superset-frontend/src/filters/components/Select/SelectFilterPlugin.tsx#L221-L224\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-11-01 at 1 48 34 PM](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1392866/5d619acc-9001-4338-87b8-caa94eda018d)\r\n\r\nTo get the list of unique values, it compares the entire data list (`arrayIncludesWith`) using object equality comparison (`isEqual`). This is slow because the data contains several attributes, and object equality comparison is slow.\r\n\r\nAs it shown in the above metric, `uniqueOptions` operation triggers four times every time a filter component re-renders, which takes more than 2 seconds per re-render for 10 filters (i.e. 50ms * 4 * 10 filters = 2s).\r\n\r\nUsing a hashmap approach (with unnecessary equality check)  reduced the delay from ~200m(=50ms * 4) to 10ms (95% reduction)\r\n![Screenshot 2023-11-01 at 1 47 15 PM](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1392866/bd271944-c87d-4937-ade8-106fbc568489)\r\n\r\n#### 2. Redundant filter re-renders due to the dynamic sizing\r\n\r\n|Initially renders at a minimum width and then expands to its full width.|\r\n|--|\r\n|![native-filter-width-overrendering](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1392866/ea9f768b-dd3a-4f25-9e9e-fd68005f713f)|\r\n\r\nSince the native filter's allocated to 100% of its width using [SuperChart](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/e7a187680713867f22b082f3bb0a57296d2a331c/superset-frontend/packages/superset-ui-core/src/chart/components/SuperChart.tsx#L245-L258), which is wrapped by `@vx/responsive`, it triggers re-renders every time the screen size is updated.\r\nThis commit removes the resize observer (by assigning the static width) and updates the filter component wrapper to the full width using CSS instead. As a result, the filters no longer re-render when the page size changes.\r\n![native-filter-css-width](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1392866/19fc445b-4a2f-4808-a60d-b7c94a2d382b)\r\n\r\n#### 3. descendants over-rendering\r\n\r\nReact's inherent behavior of rerendering all descendant components, coupled with the Redux container's rerendering upon state changes, leads to excessive rerendering of dashboard components, including filter components, whenever the chart fetch status updates the Redux store.\r\nThis commit replaces DashboardBuilder to the identical descendant (`props.children`) which prevents the rerenders when the container component rerenders.\r\nTo further optimize performance, the dashboard state synchronization logic was moved to a separate component, effectively decoupling it from the DashboardPage component and preventing unnecessary rerenders of the DashboardPage.\r\n\r\n#### 4. Redundant `__cache` attribute\r\n\r\n|Due to superfluous setDataMask calls triggered by __cache update, each setState update causes four unnecessary uniqWith executions|\r\n|--|\r\n|![fix_native_filters___rendering_performance_improvement_by_reduce_overrendering_by_justinpark_·_Pull_Request__25901_·_apache_superset](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1392866/f9df28ce-f6fb-4bd9-9aed-a817a0bbf064)|\r\n\r\nAn unnecessary __cache value was introduced in the SelectFilterPlugin in [PR#14869](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/14869/commits/1749ed542a4f4cedc6847316bf65fc2b82eb1fbd#diff-b4d2de68c8a3b04879772237085ede1b49a6908b6f2890a9ab1aaeae9e18b854R65), but it was never utilized and resulted in superfluous rerenders of filter components.\r\nThis commit removes this redundant `__cache` value to resolve the problem.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nSuccessfully optimized the application's performance, resulting in a 10% decrease in rendering count (255 to 228) and a remarkable 60% reduction in loading time (10.9 seconds to 4.5 seconds).\r\n\r\n|Before|After|\r\n|--|--|\r\n|![Screenshot 2023-11-07 at 3 57 28 PM](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1392866/2e5dc6ad-a5e1-4e66-9e96-01f1fb3d7733)|![Screenshot 2023-11-07 at 3 58 18 PM](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1392866/4d82aa63-b884-467c-ace7-b2834c2d2841)|\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Go to any dashboard\r\n2. Add more than 10 select filters\r\n3. Reload dashboard\r\n4. See that filters take a lot of time for before render.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the Trino `execute_with_cursor` method:\r\n\r\n1. It uses a `threading.Event` to indicate that the query running in a separate thread has finished, removing the overhead of context switching that happens with `sleep()` calls.\r\n2. More importantly, it removes the call to `query.id` from inside the thread. The `Query` object is loaded lazily, so when `query.id` is accessed we need to use the session to retrieve the ID. In certain deployments the call to get the session inside the thread might fail (at Preset it fails because the thread is missing additional context that the application has).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nDB engine specs have an attribute called `allows_alias_in_select`, indicating if they support aliases in `SELECT` statements. For Dremio, this attribute is version dependent — see the fix in [their release notes](https://docs.dremio.com/current/release-notes/version-240-release/#2410-release-notes-june-2023).\r\n\r\nBecause of that, we've been ping-ponging on the attribute. First I disabled it in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23872, and later it was re-enabled in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/25657 when the fix came out. Since we have Superset users running older versions, I added a new class method `get_allows_alias_in_select`, that uses the `version` field in the database extra configuration.\r\n\r\nNote that this requires users running Dremio < 24.1.0 to explicitly add the `version` field when configuring their databases. I'm not sure if we could determine the version at runtime, but even if we could it would require us to run a pre-query every time, which is needlessly expensive.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the `version` field is already used in Presto for version-dependent features.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nTwo things here:\r\n\r\n1) The SIP button recently disappeared. I think it might be due to the bad markdown link OR the fact that we had a URL sitting there as a (non-working) markdown link. This adds parenthesis back to it, for good measure.\r\n\r\n2) The Slack link wasn't working. I assume it's because the string contained a slash that was causing a parsing error. Hopefully this fixes it? ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently, guest users can get access to more data than they need to when viewing an embedded dashboard.  The `api/v1/dashboard/{id}` and `api/v1/dashboard/{id}/datasets` endpoints would return owners' first and last names. The latter would return information about the underlying database(s) the datasets belong to, which could be useful for an attacker.  None of this data is necessary for the embedded dashboard to render.\r\n\r\nI recognize this PR does break typical API patterns by stripping out certain data depending on the type of user requesting, which is pretty ugly.  However, this approach avoids making breaking changes for regular API use, while making the embedded experience more secure.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user applies a temporal filter to a mixed chart on a dashboard, then opens that chart with dashboard filters and overwrites the chart (no changes required), the temporal filter from adhoc_filter_b is removed and it's not replaced by \"no filter\" (which is required for dashboard temporal filters to work).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/a646a6ba-2a16-471c-9ce8-26528a99c5f0\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/5447471e-3a7a-4087-8719-7aa2991f8e19\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a Mixed Chart using the `cleaned_sales_data` dataset. \r\n2. Use `order_date` as the X-Axis with any time grain.\r\n3. Use any metric on queries A and B.\r\n4. Save the chart to a dashboard, and access it\r\n5. Add a temporal filter in the dashboard.\r\n6. Apply a value to the temporal filter, and then access the chart (which will carry the temporal filters).\r\n7. Overwrite the chart (no need to perform any actual changes).\r\n8. Access the dashboard, and apply a new temporal filter.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis adds a new plugin `plugin-chart-cartodiagram` that allows creating cartodiagrams, i.e. charts on a map. See also https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/21758.\r\n\r\n## How does it work?\r\n\r\nIn order to support as many charts as possible, we created some kind of a meta plugin that takes configurations of any existing chart plugin supported by superset and places it on a map. To do so, we make all charts with a common data source selectable, and inject a group-by property based on a provided geometry column. Then, we use the `buildQuery()` and `transformProps()` functions of each chart in combination with the respective chart component (via the `ChartComponentRegistry`) to render them on a map. Through this, all configuration options of any chart are supported.\r\n\r\nAdditional configuration options for cartodiagrams are:\r\n\r\n- **Map extent**: Either fit the view to the extent of the chart data (every item should be visible), or defined a custom extent by moving the map to the desired location.\r\n- **Background layers**: Add an arbitrary number of background layers to the map. Currently the formats WMS (raster), XYZ (raster) and WFS (vector) in multiple versions are supported. Vector layers can be styled in the explore view.\r\n- **Background color of chart**: The background color and opacity of the chart can be configured in order to improve the readability of a chart depending on the configured background layers.\r\n- **Corner radius of chart**: Set the corner radius of the wrapping `<div>` element of a chart.\r\n- **Zoom based chart size**: Set the chart size for each zoom level in order to avoid cluttering. Predefined functions to compute all values are provided (`fixed`, `linear`, `exponential`).\r\n\r\nDefault layers can be configured in `MainPreset.js` which will be shown by default for every configured cartodiagram panel. Users are able to edit/remove these layers for a single panel in the explore view. Default layers currently include a WMS showing OpenStreetMap data in grayscale.\r\n\r\n*Disclaimer*: The service providing the OpenStreetMap data is a demo service hosted by terrestris GmbH & Co. KG, which is my employer. On a higher zoomlevel, it shows a watermark for our paid service. The demo server is not recommended to be used in production and we recommend replacing this service. It was just added for others to have a default background map while getting familiar with the plugin and probably should be replaced in the future.\r\n\r\n## Technical Details/Requirements\r\n\r\nAdditional libraries:\r\n- **[OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/)** as mapping library\r\n- **[GeoStyler](https://geostyler.org/)** for styling of vector data (disclaimer: I am one of the maintainers of GeoStyler)\r\n\r\nBoth libraries are part of the [Open Source Geospatial Foundation](https://www.osgeo.org/), so the chances of future development of those libraries are quite certain.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn order to make use of above libraries, we had to update some dependencies (e.g. typescript, see also https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24272), and we also had to make use of `npm dedupe` in order to resolve version conflicts. Unfortunately, this resulted in a nearly complete rewrite of the `package-lock.json`.\r\n\r\nDue to some version upgrades, we also had to apply some linting fixes, which results in more changed files than actually directly related to this PR. Sorry for that.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe `<SelectControl>` had to be changed a little to be able to add a customized list of options. We use it to display all charts with a common dataset and also check, if a previously selected chart was updated after the selection.\r\n\r\n## Limitations\r\n\r\nThere are some limitations of the plugin, which probably should be addressed in the future:\r\n\r\n- We currently only support geometries in the coordinate reference system (CRS) ~`EPSG:3857` (WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator)~ _EPSG:4326 (WGS 84)_. Additional CRSs might be added in the future.\r\n- For now, we expect the geometry column to return a GeoJSON point geometry for placing the charts on the map. Additional geometries (e.g. lines and polygons), as well as additional formats (WellKnownText, lat/lon, etc.) might be added in the future.\r\n- Rendering performance can be improved and varies strongly depending on the used chart type.\r\n- ~Currently, filters applied to a dashboard are not reflected in the cartodiagram plugin. We would be grateful, if someone can hint us to the right direction for supporting this.~ Dashboard filters are now supported.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSince the background layers point to external services, the CSP have to be adjusted. Additional information can be found in the README of the plugin.\r\n\r\n## How can this be improved?\r\n\r\nThis PR is just the first step into the direction for additional geospatial support. So there are many things that can be added and improved. Besides the points mentioned above, following points might also be useful:\r\n\r\n- Adding a FeatureFlag to chart plugins that should be allowed to place on a map is probably a nice feature that was also already discussed with @villebro. To do so, the filter options of the REST API need to be extended.\r\n- Improved caching of the charts in the client, in order to reduce the number of rerenderings of a chart.\r\n- Adding the geometries of the actual dataset as a background layer and allow styling it.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n**Example dashboard with some cartodiagrams:**\r\n\r\n![superset-plugin-demo-dashboard](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/12186477/4f373083-ea87-407b-be0a-f11c464b8073)\r\n\r\n**Explore view of cartodiagram plugin (configuration):**\r\n\r\n![superset-plugin-demo-configuration](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/12186477/829a4b5a-d654-4cda-ba95-af8b0a331671)\r\n\r\n**Explore view of cartodiagram plugin (customization):**\r\n\r\n![superset-plugin-demo-customize](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/12186477/a7056cad-7dba-47c3-a840-796ac147d393)\r\n\r\n**Explore view of cartodiagram plugin (layer configuration):**\r\n\r\n![superset-plugin-demo-layer-configuration](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/12186477/a24909cb-bc8b-4e30-8a8d-0d0c5c7c1fa7)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Explore view of cartodiagram plugin (layer styling):**\r\n\r\n![superset-plugin-demo-layer-styling](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/12186477/93b7aa9e-d151-43f6-a3b5-afd8dde6e9c3)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

issue which was a byproduct of another fix—https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24158. \r\n\r\nSpecifically the previous logic to use the verbose name (if the key sans `%` was present) would fallback to the key (containing the `%`) if not present (which is the case for ad-hoc metrics) and then (re)apply the `%`, i.e., rather than `%SUM(num)` the label would be `%%SUM(num)`. The fix is simply to only include the `%` prefix in the label if the key (sans `%`) is present in the map.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### BEFORE \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-03 at 3 17 53 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/4567245/21c760f8-54f4-4ef2-a336-c3e5c9ee6589\">\r\n\r\n#### AFTER \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-03 at 3 14 02 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/4567245/e566a503-48c3-4f14-b5f2-c0a318ffba1a\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nI've adjusted the tagToSelectOption function to key off the id instead of the name. This is to address a specific issue with our async select component.\r\nThe component wasn't effectively using the data when name, value, and label were identical. This redundancy wasn't practical and didn't utilize the potential of unique identifiers.\r\nBy keying on id, which is inherently unique, the async select component now operates as intended, with clear and distinct options.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nPreviously, this was a constant of powers of ten from 10 to 100000 and then we tacked on maxRow on the end, being the SQL_MAX_ROW config. This unfortunately results is very confusing behaviour if SQL_MAX_ROW is less than 100,000 as it still let you select 100,000, though wouldn't acctually use that LIMIT, and the messaging would not acknowledge the setting for SQL_MAX_ROW either.\r\n\r\nInstead, construct the list by ascending through powers of ten until we reach the configured SQL_MAX_ROW.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### Before\r\n![BEFORE-static](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/2862039/64df2d87-0282-44c9-a9d3-7a94cb28e4be)\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n![AFTER-dynamic](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/2862039/e28b06f7-2db9-4225-a215-088a31dc7fc5)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Set `SQL_MAX_ROW` to a value less than 100,000 or greater than 1,000,000\r\n2. Use the LIMIT dropdown in SQL Lab\r\n3. Observe that the drop down no longer displays values higher than `SQL_MAX_ROW`, and will display every power of 10 up to `SQL_MAX_ROW`\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

many to related to [SIP-92 Proposal for restructuring the Python code base](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/20630). Specifically it organizes all the Commands under the superset/commands subfolder. The naming convention adheres to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24331, though upon further inspection the`daos/annotation.py` file was renamed to `daos/annotation_layer.py` given that Annotation Layer is actually the umbrella construct. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the `log_to_statsd=` functionality from the `@event_logger` and replaces usage with already existing `@statsd_metrics` decorator. I basically moved `BaseSupersetApiMixin` from `base_api.py` --> `base.py` so that the flask views can use @statsd_metrics too.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are two decorators for basically the same use case:\r\n- `@event_logger.log_this_with_context(log_to_statsd=True)`\r\n- `@statsd_metrics`\r\n\r\nThe `@event_logger` just increments a statsd counter, while `@statsd_metrics` additionally measures the execution time of a function.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n- run unit + integration tests\r\n- manually checked for new statsd metrics\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

SUMMARY\r\nWhen the underlaying dataset of a chart uses Jinja, some charts are not applying the time_grain properly to the inner query after you change it in the dashboard filters. Regular table charts work just fine.\r\n\r\nLooking at what might be causing this, the call we're making to the API is omitting `extras.time_grain_sqla` when `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` is enabled which is our default now.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a first attempt to fix the issue by just putting that back in the API calls so Jinja time_grain is no longer None and gets properly applied.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: time_grain defaults to `YEAR` ignoring the filter.\r\n\r\n![error](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/38889534/84356f8d-abf7-4286-9a4e-ba584e0aa567)\r\n\r\nAfter: charts applying the time_grain in the filter.\r\n\r\n![test](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/38889534/855cb18c-37ad-4143-8a8d-9c914adec1ab)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a dataset using below SQL query:\r\n```\r\nwith jinja_grain as (\r\nSELECT DATE_TRUNC(\r\n{%- if time_grain == 'P1D' -%}\r\n 'DAY'\r\n{%- elif time_grain == 'P1W' -%}\r\n 'WEEK'\r\n{%- elif time_grain == 'P1M' -%}\r\n 'MONTH'\r\n{%- elif time_grain == 'P3M' -%}\r\n 'QUARTER'\r\n{%- elif time_grain == 'P1Y' -%}\r\n 'YEAR'\r\n{% else %}\r\n 'YEAR'\r\n{%- endif -%}\r\n ,order_date\r\n) AS order_date_grained, *\r\nFROM \"Vehicle Sales\" \r\n)\r\nselect * from jinja_grain\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Use the dataset and create a pivot table. Use order_date_grained for rows and sum(sales) for metrics.\r\n3. Save and add to a dashboard.\r\n4. On the dashboard, add Time Grain filter.\r\n5. Apply a different Time Grain from the filter.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nReimplement, in a simpler way, part of the PRESTO_EXPAND_DATA feature for trino.\r\n\r\nMake use of the trino library's type expansion logic added since the original feature was introduced, as we now have sqla ROW types parsed out recursively in a way we can analyse.\r\n\r\nAnalyse those ROWs and expand our definition of get_columns out to include dotted.path references to all fields it's possible to query by dotted path (i.e. all ROWs, nested arbitrarily deep).\r\n\r\nAdd an extra optional query_as field to the column definition so that we can override the way it's queried: otherwise sqlalchemy is going to quote the whole thing as a single column name, which isn't correct, it should actually be quoted per dotted segment, and we'll want to alias it to the full dotted string.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n#### Before / without feature flag\r\n\r\n#####

Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. Configure a trino database and check \"Enable row expansion in schemas\" in Advanced > SQL Lab settings.\r\n2. Query tables in trino containing rows and/or nested rows\r\n3. Observe that dotted paths are expanded out on the schema preview, and queried in the table preview\r\n\r\nTo easily construct some data containing nested rows, you can use the following instructions:\r\n1. Run `trinodb/trino:latest` in docker\r\n2. `docker exec -it trino trino` to cli into it\r\n3. Create a table with nested fields like this:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nUSE memory.default;\r\nCREATE TABLE foo AS (\r\n  WITH\r\n    data AS (\r\n      SELECT\r\n        (\r\n          SELECT\r\n            ARRAY[1, 2, 3] arr1,\r\n            ARRAY[4, 5, 6] arr2,\r\n            (\r\n              SELECT\r\n                (SELECT 'foo' foo, 'bar' bar) nest1a,\r\n                (SELECT 'hodor' foo, 'HODOR HODOR HODOR' bar) nest1b\r\n            ) nest1,\r\n            (\r\n              SELECT\r\n                (SELECT 'baz' baz, 'buzz' buzz) nest2a,\r\n                (SELECT 'bzzzzzzt' buzzing, 'BZZZZZT!' buzzsaw) nest2b\r\n            ) nest2\r\n        ) field1,\r\n        'toplevel' field2\r\n    )\r\n  SELECT * FROM data\r\n\r\n);\r\n```\r\n4. Connect to the dockerised trino via superset; I did this by simply adding my trino container into the standard docker-compose definiton, so I could connect to it via `trino://root@trino:8080/memory/default`\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/25147 as we detected an issue after deploying 3.0.1 where the native UNIX time wasn't correctly converted to adhere to the Python date time format of the underlying column.\r\n\r\nFor example the `ds` column is a `VARCHAR` encoded via the `%Y-%m-%d` format yet was being treated as a UNIX timestamp. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"229\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-27

augmented version of 3.0.1 with said commit reverted. Note the reason for reverting as opposed to fixing forward is there seems to be a number of open comments with regards to the change and thus it seems more prudent to roll back and reimplement the logic. Additionally it is overly clear—per the PR description—what underlying issue the normalization/denormalization logic was trying to resolve.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!---

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe `where_in` Jinja macro allows users to specify a quote, which is potentially unsafe. I modified it to use the dialect tooling to perform the quote.\r\n\r\nFor macros that had an optional quote character specified, the user will now get a warning telling it was deprecated:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT action, count(*) as times\r\nFROM logs\r\nWHERE action in {{ filter_values('action_type'))|where_in('`') }}\r\nGROUP BY action\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecomes something like:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT action, count(*) as times\r\nFROM logs\r\nWHERE action in ('reply', 'comment', 'post')\r\n-- WARNING: the `mark` parameter was removed from the `where_in` macro for security reasons\r\nGROUP BY action\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nAdded unit
