grab bag of Prism fixes to make progress with #31583 and #28187. This follows up from #31644 which was about unblocking WordCount.\r\n\r\n* Add a debug coder print function to better see structure of coders, for debugging prism coder issues. Intended for targetted usage and may not be a permanent fixture.\r\n* Re-write PCollections that are used as Flatten inputs to use the Flatten's output coder as their coder. Python has a habit of re-deriving coders, so we need to ensure that encoded bytes can be decoded on the other side. Prism doesn't unzip/sink flattens yet, which may make this unnecessary in the future.\r\n* Remove a noisy log about composite URNs. It is no longer useful, especially with Python at this stage.\r\n* recover from panics when building stages and their descriptors, so a prism instance doesn't crash during execution of a sequence of tests. This produces more meaningful test output to users as well, though most failures at this stage represent prism bugs.\r\n* Relaxing OutputTime and Always Trigger in the pre-filter allows more tests to run. Some are  failing due to these features not being correctly implemented at this stage, so this is acceptable for now to allow Python usage to advance.\r\n* The Python SDK was very noisy when the GRPC server was hard stopped, vs Gracefully stopped. This removes the noise, but keeps the hard stop after 5 seconds just in case an SDK is taking too long to shut down after the control RPC is closed.\r\n\r\nThese are tested via the Python SDK validates runner tests at the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

reshuffle adds a barrier so that the read records were committed before possibly committing offsets. However this is unnecessary as the DoFn is annotated with RequiresStableInput and the fusion barrier can be introduced with just shuffling the offsets.\r\n\r\nIn both cases it is possible for a commit offset to be committed back to kafka before the data has been entirely processed by the pipeline. However with support to drain data from the pipeline (such as in Cloud Dataflow) this allows for exactly-once semantics for KafkaIO via the committed offsets to the topics across pipeline drain and restart.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#31674 \r\n\r\nThere is an issue with the `AvroGenericRecordToStorageApiProto.java` class in Apache Beam, which is responsible for converting an Avro generic record into a proto object for writing to BigQuery using the Storage API.\r\n\r\nThe funtion `private TableFieldSchema fieldDescriptorFromAvroField(Schema.Field field)` handles the array types effectively when the array in the Avro schema is defined as follows:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"anullablearray\",\r\n  \"type\": \"array\",\r\n  \"items\": \"string\",\r\n  \"default\": []\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nit produces such a proto field as expected:\r\n\r\n```proto\r\nname: \"De0c5bb51_aded_475d_946d_6ece875416a8\"\r\nfield {\r\n  name: \"anullablearray\"\r\n  number: 1\r\n  label: LABEL_REPEATED\r\n  type: TYPE_STRING\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it doesn't preserve the type `array` and uses the element type of the array when a nullable array is used, such as:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"anullablearray\",\r\n  \"type\": [\r\n    \"null\",\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"array\",\r\n      \"items\": \"string\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"default\": null\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nin this case, it produces such a proto field which is not expected and wrong:\r\n\r\n```proto\r\nname: \"D94a1b8de_41fa_4d59_b308_999b9fc12f0a\"\r\nfield {\r\n  name: \"anullablearray\"\r\n  number: 1\r\n  label: LABEL_OPTIONAL\r\n  type: TYPE_STRING\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile handling the union, the function overwrites the array element type with nullability and results in this behaviour. I believe, it can be easily fixed by setting the `mode` with the union field schema in the `TableSchemaBuilder` while constructing the schema.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

This time has not only the important bugs fixes just like before, but more importantly comes with the drastic &quot;compilation time&quot; performance improvements!</p>\n<h2>Bug fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Various WASI related bug fixes contributed by <a href=\"https://github.com/yagehu\"><code>@​yagehu</code></a>  <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2244\">#2244</a> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2229\">#2229</a> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2223\">#2223</a></li>\n<li>Syscall compatibility fix on Windows by <a href=\"https://github.com/ncruces\"><code>@​ncruces</code></a> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2218\">#2218</a></li>\n<li>api.Memory.Grow call bug introduced in v1.7.0 by <a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2216\">#2216</a> (thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/mark-pictor-csec\"><code>@​mark-pictor-csec</code></a> for reporting)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Compilation perf improvements</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a> worked so hard to improve the compilation performance which some users had raised issue about since the release of the optimizing compiler in 1.7.0. The idea is that even though this is partly because it is &quot;optimizing&quot;, there are still rooms for improvements in its codebase to use less CPU/memory.</p>\n<p>The below is the compilation time benchmark on the various standard library tests for Zig, Go and TinyGo compared to the previous v1.7.2.  You can see the huge results up to like <strong>50% faster and ~50% less memory usage</strong>. Note that this doesn't affect any runtime performance -- that means your code runs just exactly like before while having faster compilation!😎</p>\n<pre><code>goos: darwin\ngoarch: arm64\npkg: github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/internal/integration_test/stdlibs\n                                                   │   old.txt    │              new.txt               │\n                                                   │    sec/op    │   sec/op     vs base               │\nZig/Compile/test-opt.wasm-10                           4.872 ± 2%    3.389 ± 3%  -30.44% (p=0.001 n=7)\nZig/Compile/test.wasm-10                               5.926 ± 2%    4.162 ± 1%  -29.76% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/container_heap.test-10                 677.2m ± 0%   306.3m ± 1%  -54.76% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/container_list.test-10                 673.2m ± 1%   309.3m ± 8%  -54.05% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/container_ring.test-10                 665.1m ± 1%   299.5m ± 0%  -54.97% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/crypto_des.test-10                     686.4m ± 0%   311.6m ± 0%  -54.61% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/crypto_md5.test-10                     685.5m ± 1%   312.7m ± 4%  -54.38% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/crypto_rc4.test-10                     666.5m ± 0%   297.9m ± 0%  -55.31% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/crypto_sha1.test-10                    683.7m ± 0%   310.1m ± 0%  -54.65% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/crypto_sha256.test-10                  692.0m ± 1%   315.0m ± 2%  -54.48% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/crypto_sha512.test-10                  692.7m ± 0%   316.6m ± 1%  -54.29% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/encoding_ascii85.test-10               680.6m ± 1%   309.3m ± 1%  -54.55% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/encoding_base32.test-10               1637.6m ± 1%   650.8m ± 0%  -60.26% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/encoding_csv.test-10                   740.0m ± 1%   333.5m ± 0%  -54.92% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/encoding_hex.test-10                   708.7m ± 3%   320.9m ± 0%  -54.72% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/go_scanner.test-10                     773.2m ± 1%   347.1m ± 6%  -55.11% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/hash.test-10                           951.8m ± 1%   410.8m ± 0%  -56.84% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/hash_adler32.test-10                   665.8m ± 1%   297.5m ± 0%  -55.32% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/hash_crc64.test-10                     893.9m ± 1%   385.1m ± 1%  -56.92% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/hash_fnv.test-10                       695.8m ± 2%   312.4m ± 0%  -55.10% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/html.test-10                            2.426 ± 1%    2.012 ± 1%  -17.07% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/internal_itoa.test-10                  662.5m ± 1%   296.0m ± 1%  -55.32% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/internal_profile.test-10               893.6m ± 1%   417.9m ± 0%  -53.24% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/math.test-10                           821.1m ± 0%   398.4m ± 0%  -51.48% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/math_cmplx.test-10                     701.7m ± 0%   338.8m ± 1%  -51.71% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/net.test-10                            755.4m ± 1%   356.5m ± 3%  -52.81% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/net_http_internal_ascii.test-10        661.5m ± 1%   296.8m ± 2%  -55.14% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/net_mail.test-10                       927.1m ± 2%   398.9m ± 2%  -56.97% (p=0.001 n=7)\nTinyGo/Compile/os.test-10                             754.9m ± 0%   370.5m ± 0%  -50.92% (p=0.001 n=7)\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

#31652 \r\nFixes #29516 \r\n\r\nWhile trying the BigQuery Storage Write Api, I've come across an issue in the `AvroGenericRecordToStorageApiProto.java` file in the Apache Beam repository. Specifically, the issue lies in the following lines of code:\r\n\r\n- [Line 250](https://github.com/apache/beam/blame/561bf2f07e15719e9d698d2d57455e050246105e/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/AvroGenericRecordToStorageApiProto.java#L250)\r\n- [Line 349](https://github.com/apache/beam/blame/561bf2f07e15719e9d698d2d57455e050246105e/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/AvroGenericRecordToStorageApiProto.java#L349)\r\n\r\nIn these lines, the `getElementType` method is being called on a `schema` object:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nSchema valueType = TypeWithNullability.create(schema.getElementType()).getType();\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the `schema` object is of type `MapSchema`, which does not implement the `getElementType` method. This method is only implemented for `ArraySchema`. For all other types, it defaults to the `Schema` class and throws an `AvroRuntimeException`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n/** If this is an array, returns its element type. */\r\npublic Schema getElementType() {\r\n  throw new AvroRuntimeException(\"Not an array: \" + this);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of calling `getElementType`,  `getValueType` could be called as follows:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nSchema valueType = TypeWithNullability.create(schema.getValueType()).getType();\r\n```\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

plumbs Redistribute \"allow_duplicates\" property to Dataflow.\r\n\r\nReason to cherry-pick:\r\n\r\nWith release-2.57.0, Dataflow customers can use per-stage checkpointless shuffle (which allows duplicated elements in the output) by using the Redistribute transform, rather than having to enable checkpointless shuffle mode for the entire pipeline through an experiment.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

result in a server panic at startup when <code>tav.idx</code> files were incorrectly truncated down to zero bytes. You can work around this problem by deleting <code>tav.idx</code> files that are zero bytes in length before starting the server. Zero-byte files could exist as a result of a previous server crash before a successful file sync to disk occurred.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Go Version</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1.22.3 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5438\">#5438</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dependencies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>github.com/nats-io/jwt/v2 v2.5.6 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5328\">#5328</a>)</li>\n<li>golang.org/x/sys v0.20.0 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5388\">#5388</a>)</li>\n<li>golang.org/x/crypto v0.23.0 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5413\">#5413</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Left and Right subject mapping operations (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5337\">#5337</a>) Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/sspates\"><code>@​sspates</code></a> for the contribution!</li>\n<li>Add a <code>/expvarz</code> monitoring endpoint (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5374\">#5374</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Improved</h3>\n<p>Accounts</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Change <code>AccountResolver()</code> to use read lock to prevent contention (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5351\">#5351</a>)</li>\n<li>Improve muxed routes with large subject space (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5399\">#5399</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gateway</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outbound may fail to detect stale connection (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5356\">#5356</a>) Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/wjordan\"><code>@​wjordan</code></a> for the report!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>JetStream</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Optimize stream subject matching implementation (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5316\">#5316</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5324\">#5324</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5329\">#5329</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5342\">#5342</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5353\">#5353</a>)</li>\n<li>Improve filestore LoadNextMsg performance (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5401\">#5401</a>)</li>\n<li>Prevent blocking writes on meta state filestore flush (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5333\">#5333</a>)</li>\n<li>Add logging to measure <code>writeFullState</code> and <code>enforceMsgPerSubjectLimit</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5340\">#5340</a>)</li>\n<li>Do not hold filestore lock on msg block loads when looking up the first sequence for subject (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5363\">#5363</a>)</li>\n<li>Improve various stream sourcing and mirror behaviors and performance (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5366\">#5366</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5372\">#5372</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5379\">#5379</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5389\">#5389</a>)</li>\n<li>Increase the compression threshold for Raft traffic (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5371\">#5371</a>)</li>\n<li>Put a maximum idle flush time for the filestore (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5370\">#5370</a>)</li>\n<li>Updated subject state expiration (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5377\">#5377</a>)</li>\n<li>Simplify writing the full state to index.db (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5378\">#5378</a>)</li>\n<li>Added in separate last subject timestamp to track access (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5380\">#5380</a>)</li>\n<li>Check consumer leader status without locks (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5386\">#5386</a>)</li>\n<li>Various Raft improvements with limited to no state (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5427\">#5427</a>)</li>\n<li>Improved consumer with AckAll performance of first ack with large first stream sequence (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5446\">#5446</a>)</li>\n<li>Various stream catchup improvements (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5454\">#5454</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WebSocket</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve generating INFO data to send to clients (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/5405\">#5405</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

#21162\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to use the existing `PubsubMessageWithAttributesAndMessageIdCoder` because it doesn't encode/decode the message's topic, which is needed for dynamic destinations. There are already a number of existing coders (6) developed over the years. Every time a new feature/parameter is added to PubsubMessage, we need to make a new coder and fork the code to maintain update compatibility.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this for the future, this PR introduces a SchemaCoder for PubsubMessage. SchemaCoder allows us to evolve the  schema over time, so hopefully new features can be added in the future without breaking update compatibility.\r\n\r\n--------\r\nNote that PubsubMessage's default coder is `PubsubMessageWithAttributesCoder`, which can't be updated without breaking backwards compatibility (see #23525). Wherever PubsubMessages are created in a pipeline, we would have to manually override the coder to `PubsubMessageSchemaCoder.getSchemaCoder()` or the ordering key will get lost.","created_at":"2024-06-15T02:21:35Z","updated_at":"2025-02-08T12:14:18Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1836391716,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM2MzkxNzE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/java","name":"java","color":"001cf2","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842356709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyMzU2NzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/io","name":"io","color":"9ee534","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842436405,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyNDM2NDA1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/runners","name":"runners","color":"3b087c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842888410,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyODg4NDEw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/dataflow","name":"dataflow","color":"3b087c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842938092,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyOTM4MDky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/gcp","name":"gcp","color":"9ee534","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3888027569,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAwi8tc7nvpex","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/Next%20Action:%20Reviewers","name":"Next

the original way of validating Bigtable Change Stream table existance to improve compatibility with testing.\r\n\r\nIn #31376 I moved around validation and introduced a different way of checking the existence of the Change Stream table using BigtableServiceFactory instead of BigtableChangeStreamAccessor. BigtableChangeStreamAccessor has some customization that is not included in BigtableServiceFactory and is needed for integration testing against different environments.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we have only one way of interfacing with Bigtable services, so we would merge BigtableServiceFactory and BigtableChangeStreamAccessor. But meanwhile, we should revert back to using BigtableChangeStreamAccessor in the ChangeStream connector.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
