I've peeled it off and fixed it up and added a smidge of testing. Since the code is entirely shared, just making sure the right path is taken provides moderate coverage.

better)","created_at":"2016-11-01T22:42:36Z","updated_at":"2016-11-12T03:02:35Z","closed_at":"2016-11-04T17:08:50Z","merged_at":"2016-11-04T17:08:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"8bf6d92cf35d11f4f3b02dae677a4fe778d34a61","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1252/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1252/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1252/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/8bf6d92cf35d11f4f3b02dae677a4fe778d34a61","head":{"label":"kennknowles:DoFnSignatures","ref":"DoFnSignatures","sha":"8bf6d92cf35d11f4f3b02dae677a4fe778d34a61","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

This is a step towards that API. I think it is also just better in most ways, especially for being able to delete timers without having to know exactly when it was set for.\n\nBefore this change, a timer's ID is its `TimeDomain` + `Instant`. Inlining `TimerData` for this description, I think `setTimer(TimeDomain, Instant)` is OK for setting an anonymous \"wake up\" as we use it today, while `deleteTimer(TimeDomain, Instant)` should be removed.\n\nR: @tgroh and @aljoscha and @amitsela \n\nI am curious about runner-specific thoughts if you have

sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\nquickly and easily:\n- [x] Make sure the PR title is formatted like:\n  `[BEAM-<Jira issue #>] Description of pull request`\n- [x] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`. (Even better, enable\n     Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\n- [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\n     number, if there is one.\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\n     [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\n\n---\n\nAggregator IDs are used to ensure that an Aggregator's identity is\nconsistent across synchronization barriers. This is only relevant when\nconstructing the map of Step -> Aggregator to enable querying, as the\nDoFns represented within the graph may be serialized. The identity has\nno impact on the interaction between the runner and aggregator, which is\nthe responsibility of the ProcessContext object and\nsetupDelegateAggregators.\n\nUUID#randomUUID uses a shared SecureRandom to create the bytes of the\nUUID; SecureRandom#nextBytes is a synchronized method, so regardless of\nthe underlying source of randomness, only one random UUID can be\ngenerated at a time. Instead, use a random long to identify aggregators.\nThis should be sufficient for user-created aggregators, and system\naggregators should not care about the

(Even better, enable\n     Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\n- [ ] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\n     number, if there is one.\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\n     [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\n\n---\n\nIn the Java SDK, components can register display data directly, as well as include display data from sub-components via the `include(..)` operation. In #1008, we add 'paths' to display data metadata and also include a `delegate(..)` action.\n\nDuring the change for paths, we noticed an emerging pattern where components will typically add the `.getClass()` of a subcomponent before including it. We can support this convention better by embedding it in a single configurable operation, `.nested(..)`\n\nSo this:\n\n``` java\n@Override\npublic void populateDisplayData(DisplayData.Builder builder) {\n  builder\n    .add(DisplayData.item(\"windowFn\", windowFn.getClass()))\n    .include(\"windowFn\", windowFn)\n    .add(DisplayData.item(\"otherProperty\", otherProp));\n}\n```\n\nbecomes
