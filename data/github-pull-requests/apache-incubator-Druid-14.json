Following changes are introduced\r\n\r\n* The folding is broken in the vectorized versions. We consider time before checking the folded object.\r\n\r\n* If the numerical aggregator gets passed any other object type for some other reason (like String), then the aggregator considers it to be folded, even though it shouldn’t be. We should convert these objects to the desired type, and aggregate them properly.\r\n\r\n* The aggregators must properly use generics. This would minimize the ClassCastException issues that can happen with mixed segment types. We are unifying the string first/last aggregators with numeric versions as well.\r\n\r\n* The aggregators must aggregate null values (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/query/aggregation/first/StringFirstLastUtils.java#L55-L56  ). The aggregator should only ignore pairs with time == null, and not value == null\r\n\r\n* Time nullity is ignored when trying to vectorize the data.\r\n\r\n* ~~String versions initialized with `DateTimes.MIN` that is equal to `Long.MIN / 2`. This can cause incorrect results in case the user enters a custom time column.~~ **NOTE:** This is still present because it would require a larger refactor in all of the versions.\r\n\r\n* There is a difference in what users might expect from the results because the code flow is changed (for example, the direction of the for loops, etc), however, this will only change the results, and not the contract set by first/last aggregators, which is that if multiple values have the same timestamp, then any of them can get picked.\r\n\r\n* If the column is non-existent, the users might expect a change in the timestamp from DateTime.MAX to Long.MAX, because the code incorrectly used DateTime.MAX to initialize the aggregator, however, in case of a custom timestamp column, this might not be the case. The SQL query might be prohibited from using any Long since it requires a cast to the timestamp function that can fail, but AFAICT native queries don't have such limitations. \r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFixup the vector first/last aggregators\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Bug:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15724 - introduced a bug where a rolling upgrade would cause all task locations returned by the Overlord on an older version to be unknown.\r\n\r\nPrior to #15724,\r\n1) OverlordResource#`getTaskStatus` for individual tasks fetched a TaskStatusResponse containing the location.\r\n2) OverlordResource#`getMultipleTaskStatuses` fetched task statuses in a batch from the metadata store. The metadata store doesn't contain the current location of an active task. Complete tasks do contain them\r\n\r\nAfter the changes,\r\n1) OverlordResource#`getTaskStatus` remains unchanged.\r\n2) OverlordResource#`getMultipleTaskStatuses` fetches task statuses for in-memory tasks from the TaskQueue and enhances them with the location from the task runner. The method fetches task statuses for completed tasks from the db.\r\n\r\nThe Overlord client was also changed to rely on the 2nd API to fetch the task status and location from memory.\r\n\r\nDuring a rolling upgrade, the task is on a version with the PR's changes and queries the 2nd API. The overlord is still on the older version and fails to return the correct location for active tasks. This can lead to task failures during rolling upgrades.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\n\r\nThe overlord client now falls back to the orignal API that always returns the task location if the 2nd API fails to return it during the rolling upgrade. After the rolling upgrade, the active tasks' statuses will be fetched from memory as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThe new overlord client was used on an upgraded Indexer / MM while the Overlord was on a version prior to #15724. The tasks succeeded as expected. (They would fail with a newer Indexer without this patch).\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis change allows for tables that are defined in the catalog to have their complex defined column types validated against source input expressions mapped to them during DML INSERT/REPLACE operations. The catalog dml unit tests have also been greatly simplified, and a lot of duplicate test code simplified or removed.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Issue\r\nWhile serializing a `Map` or even a `List` containing `TaskReport` objects, the `type` information is lost. Thus, the object cannot be serialized back.\r\n\r\nThis is a known issue with Jackson.\r\n\r\n### Existing solution in Druid\r\nThe serialization of a `Map<String, TaskReport>` was originally fixed in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12938.\r\n\r\nThe way this has been tackled in the Druid code till now is:\r\n- Use custom serialisation logic in `SingleFileTaskReportFileWriter.writeReportToStream()` to write out each `TaskReport` object one by one\r\n- For live reports that are served over HTTP, build a raw map instead of a concrete `TaskReport` object\r\n\n### Proposed solution\r\nAdd a new `ReportMap` class.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Add class `TaskReport.ReportMap`\r\n- Have `TaskReport.buildTaskReports()` return the new class\r\n- Add serde tests for writing to string, file for the known task report types\r\n- Replace all occurrences of `Map<String, TaskReport>` with `TaskReport.ReportMap` to ensure\r\nthat we always use this class for serialization of reports\r\n- Add method `AbstractBatchIndexTask.buildLiveIngestionStatsReport()` to reduce duplication and hard-coding of serializable field names.\r\n\r\n### Important classes\r\n- `TaskReport`\r\n- `AbstractBatchIndexTask`\r\n- `SingleFileTaskReportFileWriter`\r\n- `ParallelIndexSupervisorTask`\r\n- `SinglePhaseSubTask`\r\n- `IndexTask`\r\n\r\n### Rolling upgrade concerns\r\n\r\nNone\r\n- __Serialization__: results in the same json as before\r\n- __Deserialization__: works with the same json as before","created_at":"2024-03-29T07:57:20Z","updated_at":"2024-05-06T08:26:03Z","closed_at":"2024-04-01T18:53:25Z","merged_at":"2024-04-01T18:53:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"0de44d91f1b8aeded7bcc6c04e3058ae86215bb1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

working on this change https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15817, I encountered Guice injection issues in Coordinator after introducing a dependency on `CoordinatorSegmentMetadataCache` within `DruidCoordinator`. This cache depends on `QueryLifecycleFactory` , which in turn depends on `AuthorizerMapper` . It appears a cyclic dependency between `AuthorizerMapper` and `BasicAuthorizerCacheManager` (likely pre-existing) is causing the problem when using authentication.\r\nInterestingly, running Coordinator and Overlord as a single service locally avoids the issue.\r\n\r\nThe circular dependency chain is (this is pre-existing). \r\n```\r\nAuthorizerMapper -> BasicRoleBasedAuthroizer -> BasicAuthorizerCacheManager-> MetadataStoragePollingBasicAuthorizerCacheManager -> CoordinatorBasicAuthorizerMetadataStorageUpdater -> AuthorizerMapper\r\n```\r\nThis dependency chain `CoordinatorSegmentMetadataCache` -> `QueryLifecycleFactory` -> `AuthorizerMapper` had existed and worked fine. \r\n\r\nThe problem began with `DruidCoordinator` -> `CoordinatorSegmentMetadataCache` dependency and basic authentication, without authentication there are no issues in building the classes.\r\n\r\nstack trace\r\n```\r\n1) Problem parsing object at prefix[druid.auth.authorizer.basic]:

parsing has this function `charsetFix` that fixes up strings so they can round-trip through UTF-8 encoding without loss of fidelity. It was originally introduced to fix a bug where strings could be sorted, encoded, then decoded, and the resulting decoded strings could end up no longer in sorted order (due to character swaps during the encode operation).\r\n\r\nThe code has been in place for some time, and only applies to JSON. I am not sure if it needs to apply to other formats; it's certainly more difficult to get broken strings from other formats. It's easy in JSON because you can write a JSON string like `\"foo\\uD900\"`.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, this patch does not revisit whether `charsetFix` should be applied to all formats. It merely optimizes it for the JSON case. The function works by using `CharsetEncoder.canEncode`, which is a relatively slow method (just as expensive as actually encoding). This patch adds a short-circuit to skip `canEncode` if all chars in a string are in the basic multilingual plane (i.e. if no chars are surrogates).\r\n\r\nBenchmarks:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmaster\r\n\r\nBenchmark                              (discovery)  (readerTypeString)  Mode  Cnt     Score    Error

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes [#16148 ](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/16148)\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Update the error message to instead suggest resetting the supervisor as the primary way to fix it when this happens. The updated error message is as follows:\r\n\r\n```text\r\norg.apache.druid.error.DruidException: Inconsistency between stored metadata state[ObjectMetadata{theObject={foo=baz}}] and target state[ObjectMetadata{theObject=null}]. Try resetting the supervisor.\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Also, update the error message when the start metadata is ahead of the last committed state. \r\n\r\n#### Other cleanup changes:\r\n- Switch `startMetadataGreaterThanExisting` from an integer to boolean type to make the intent clear.\r\n- Replace an anonymous code block with lambda.\r\n- Use `DruidException` instead of `RuntimeException` in `SegmentPublishResult` failure calls.\r\n- Clean up a few code comments, redundant info log and include more information in the `SegmentPublishResult` error itself.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code

The endpoint is annotated consistent with other usages.\r\n- Update `DatasourceResourceFilter` to remove the lambda and update javadocs. The usages information is self-evident with an IDE.\r\n- Adjust the invalid interval exception message.\r\n- Break up the large unit test `testGetUnusedSegmentsInDataSource()` into smaller unit tests for each test case. Also, validate the error codes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the fix in this patch, a 400 error code is returned without the stacktrace:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -X 'GET' -H 'Content-Type:application/json' http://localhost:8081/druid/coordinator/v1/metadata/datasources/foo_it/unusedSegments\\?interval=2024-04-01T00%3A00%3A00.000Z/2024-03-01T00%3A00%3A00.000Z\r\n{\"error\":\"druidException\",\"errorCode\":\"invalidInput\",\"persona\":\"USER\",\"category\":\"INVALID_INPUT\",\"errorMessage\":\"Invalid interval[2024-04-01T00:00:00.000Z/2024-03-01T00:00:00.000Z]: [The end instant must be greater than the start instant]\",\"context\":{}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

PR provides visibility into the actions taken by `LagBasedAutoScaler` and shows us the behaviour of auto scaler. This introduced metric provides insight into what actually is desired task count, how many times did we skip such actions etc. Info obtained from this metric could later be used to tweak the auto scaler config.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n- Druid operator could compare between `ingest/autoScaler/lagBased/requiredTasks` and `task/running/count` to know the exact gap between current and desired task counts.\r\n- Druid operator could now track how many times a scale action has been skipped because\r\n    - It occurred too early than `minTriggerScaleActionFrequencyMillis`.\r\n    - Task count is already at max/min and couldn't scale further.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DynamicAllocationTasksNotice`\r\n * `LagBasedAutoScaler`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

An empty collection passed should return no results, rather than ignoring it and returning all results. \r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\n- Update the condition to handle the null and empty versions differently\r\n- Clarify javadocs on the behavior of empty versions\r\n- Add tests for the empty versions in different classes, which would fail without this patch\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #16177.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Fixed a bug in the KafkaStringHeaderReader class where ingestion would throw a NullPointerException and enter an infinite loop when encountering a Kafka header with keys but no values. The issue was resolved by adding a check to skip headers with null or empty values during header processing.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `KafkaStringHedaerReader`\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

the manual capabilities mode UX so that it is clearer that the console is in a manual capabilities mode.\r\n\r\nThe console has many degraded modes in can operate in this is to account for different (degraded) configurations of the underlying cluster. Here are a few examples:\r\n- The coordinator serves the console but does not let you query SQL\r\n- The router might be running with the management proxy turned off so the console can not reach the coordinator\r\n- The indexer might be dead and unreachable\r\n\r\nWhen the console loads it does a few probing queries to detect what capabilities are available to it. This is called capability detection.\r\n\r\nA manual capabilities mode is when the user tells the console to skip the capability detection and just put itself into some specific mode. This is useful for testing (the console) and for getting around flaws in the capability detection. Overall this is a fairly power user feature and should only be used by users that know what (and why) they are doing it.\r\n\r\nIt has come to my attention that there were some users that has their console in a manual capabilities mode and they did not know it, as a result their console was degraded. I want to update the UI so it would be more clear.\r\n\r\n## Current behavior\r\n\r\nSetting the manual capabilities

#16189\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis fixes an issue in which updating a  kafka streaming supervisors topic from single to multi-topic (pattern), or vice versa, could cause old offsets to be ignored spuriously. The details of the bug and how it manifests is in the linked issue. To fix the issue, this change properly handles using previously found partition offsets, in the case where the old offsets were recorded and stored by a streaming supervisor with or without multi topic enabled, and the new streaming supervisor has multi-topic enabled or disabled.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

at other failure types such as `InvalidInput`, `InvalidSqlInput`, etc. it makes sense to have the error code be fixed for a certain of failure.\r\n\r\nThe only two usages of the method `InternalServerError.exception()` were actually passing a whole long message in the error code. This would result in the `errorCode` field being populated with the error message and the `errorMsg` field itself taking the value of the first message argument.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Use error code `internalServerError` for failures of this type\r\n- Remove the error code argument from `InternalServerError.exception()` methods thus fixing the above mentioned bug in the

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #15882 \r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\nActive tasks fetched from TaskQueue's in memory state may reveal sensitive information.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't happen for payloads fetched from the metadata store, as they are read using a json mapper with an added mixin for redacting credentials.\r\n\r\nThis PR leans on a similar change in the TaskQueue where a payload is serialized and then deserialized.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `TaskQueue`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Bug\r\nIn the `MarkOvershadowedSegmentsAsUnused` duty, the coordinator marks a segment as unused\r\nif it is overshadowed by a segment currently being served by a historical or broker.\r\nBut it is possible to have segments that are eligible for a load rule but require zero replicas to be loaded.\r\n(Such segments can be queried only using the MSQ engine).\r\nIf such a zero-replica segment overshadows any other segment, the overshadowed segment will never be\r\nmarked as unused and will continue to exist in the metadata store as a dangling segment.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- In a coordinator run, keep track of segments that are eligible for a load rule but require zero replicas\r\n- Allow the zero-replicas segments to overshadow old segments and hence mark the latter as unused\r\n- Add simulation test to verify new behaviour. This test fails with the current code.\r\n- Clean up javadocs\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\nFix bug in the `MarkOvershadowedSegmentsAsUnused` coordinator duty to also consider segments that are overshadowed by a segment that requires zero replicas.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

chooses the shard spec based on certain criteria. However, this criteria is not very transparent to the user. The only way to find the shard spec which was chosen is to search for a segment in the segment UI after the ingestion is finished.\r\n\r\nThis PR logs the segment type and reason chosen. It also adds it to the query report, to be displayed in the UI.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new section to the reports, `segmentReport`. This contains the segment type created, if the query is an ingestion, and null otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe shardSpec mentions the shardSpec type generated. MSQ prefers to use RangedShardSpec when possible. For inserts and replace queries, the default shard spec is NumberedShardSpec and DimensionRangeShardSpec respectively. If a ranged shard spec cannot be chosen for the replace query, the details field will contain the reason why it could not be used.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"multiStageQuery\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"multiStageQuery\",\r\n    \"taskId\": \"query-3dc0c45d-34d7-4b15-86c9-cdb2d3ebfc4e\",\r\n    \"payload\": {\r\n        ... ,\r\n        \"segmentReport\": {\r\n          \"shardSpec\": \"NumberedShardSpec\",\r\n          \"details\": \"Cannot use RangeShardSpec, RangedShardSpec only supports string CLUSTER BY keys.

Issue:\r\nThe `markUsed` API accepts either an `interval` or `segmentIds`. When using segment IDs, the underlying query uses an `IN` clause with the user-provided values inlined directly in the query instead of being parameterized.\r\n\r\n#### Fix:\r\nThis patch fixes that by adding the following utilities specifically for queries that contain an `IN` clause:\r\n- `getParameterizedInConditionForColumn()`\r\n- `bindColumnValuesToQueryWithInCondition()`\r\n\r\n#### Other related changes:\r\nRenamed the following functions for consistency and code hygiene:\r\n- `appendConditionForIntervalsAndMatchMode()` to `getConditionForIntervalsAndMatchMode()`. Pass only select arguments to the function.\r\n- `bindQueryIntervals()` to `bindIntervalsToQuery()`\r\n\r\n#### Release note:\r\n\r\nThe `segmentIds` filter in the `markUsed` API payload is parameterized in the DB query.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

patch contains two controller changes that make progress towards a lower-latency MSQ.\r\n\r\nThese are both larger changes, but I developed them together and it was most straightforward to put them into a single PR rather than separating into multiple PRs, especially given they both involved changes in common files like ControllerImpl and ControllerContext.\r\n\r\n**Key classes:**\r\n\r\nThese files are the most interesting IMO.\r\n\r\n- Controller\r\n- ControllerImpl\r\n- ControllerQueryKernel\r\n- ControllerQueryKernelConfig\r\n- ControllerQueryKernelUtils (especially computeStageGroups)\r\n- ControllerContext\r\n- MSQWorkerTaskLauncher\r\n\r\n**Key changes:**\r\n\r\nFirst, support for **in-memory shuffles**. The main feature of in-memory shuffles, as far as the controller is concerned, is that they are not fully buffered. That means that whenever a producer stage uses in-memory output, its consumer must run concurrently. The controller determines which stages run concurrently, and when they start and stop.\r\n\r\n\"Leapfrogging\" allows any chain of sort-based stages to use in-memory shuffles even if we can only run two stages at once. For example, in a linear chain of stages 0 -> 1 -> 2 where all do sort-based shuffles, we can use in-memory shuffling for each one while only running two at once. (When stage 1 is done reading input and about to start writing its output, we can stop 0 and start 2.)\r\n\r\n1) New `OutputChannelMode` enum attached to `WorkOrder` that tells workers\r\n   whether stage output should be in memory (`MEMORY`), or use local or durable\r\n   storage.\r\n\r\n2) New logic in the `ControllerQueryKernel` to determine which stages can use\r\n   in-memory shuffling (`ControllerUtils#computeStageGroups`) and to launch them\r\n   at the appropriate time (`ControllerQueryKernel#createNewKernels`).\r\n\r\n3) New `doneReadingInput` method on `Controller` (passed down to the stage kernels)\r\n   which allows stages to transition to `POST_READING` even if they are not\r\n   gathering statistics. This is important because it enables \"leapfrogging\"\r\n   for `HASH_LOCAL_SORT` shuffles, and for `GLOBAL_SORT` shuffles with 1 partition.\r\n\r\n4) Moved result-reading from `ControllerContext#writeReports` to new `QueryListener`\r\n   interface, which `ControllerImpl` feeds results to row-by-row while the query\r\n   is still running. Important so we can read query results from the final\r\n   stage using an in-memory channel.\r\n\r\n5) New class `ControllerQueryKernelConfig` holds configs that control kernel\r\n   behavior (such as whether to pipeline, maximum number of concurrent stages,\r\n   etc). Generated by the `ControllerContext`.\r\n\r\nSecond, a refactor **towards running workers in persistent JVMs** that are able to cache data across queries. This is helpful because I believe we'll want to reuse JVMs and cached data for latency reasons.\r\n\r\n1) Move creation of `WorkerManager` and `TableInputSpecSlicer` to the\r\n   `ControllerContext`, rather than `ControllerImpl`. This allows managing workers and\r\n   work assignment differently when JVMs are reusable.\r\n\r\n2) Lift the Controller Jersey resource out from `ControllerChatHandler` to a\r\n   reusable resource `ControllerResource`.\r\n\r\n3) Move memory introspection to a `MemoryIntrospector` interface, and introduce\r\n   `ControllerMemoryParameters` that uses it. This makes it easier to run MSQ in\r\n   process types other than Indexer and Peon.\r\n\r\nBoth of these areas will have follow-ups that make similar changes on the worker side.","created_at":"2024-03-19T09:49:26Z","updated_at":"2024-10-04T06:46:03Z","closed_at":"2024-05-01T04:30:27Z","merged_at":"2024-05-01T04:30:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"5d1950d4512ff464975773d8c3eead44bd6b8930","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Check for handoff of upgraded realtime segments.\r\n\r\nCurrently streaming ingestion tasks check for the handoff of segments in SegmentsAndCommitMetadata.getSegments() which contains the set of segments allocated by the task.\r\nThis can lead to a temporary missing of data from queries while the upgraded segments are being handed off as they will be dropped from peons when the older versions of segments are committed.\r\nThis patch adds the set of upgraded segments to the class, to enable checking for handoff of the upgraded segments as well.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n2) Drop sink only when all associated realtime segments have been abandoned.\r\n\r\nIf a sink S is associated with (realtime) segment versions S0, S1 and S2, we must wait until all of them have been unannounced before dropping the sink.\r\n\r\n```\r\nabandon (sink, segment):\r\n    mark segment as abandoned.\r\n    if every upgraded id of the base segment is abandoned:\r\n        unannounce all upgraded ids of its base segment\r\n        drop sink\r\n```\r\n-----\r\n3) Delete pending segments upon commit\r\n\r\nA realtime task such as index_kafka or index_kinesis may append segments multiple times during its lifetime. \r\nDeleting pending segments in the same transaction in which they are committed prevents unneeded upgrades and partition space exhaustion when a concurrent replace happens.\r\nMore importantly this helps with change (2) to prevent a race where an upgraded pending segment is announced for a committed segment causing temporary data duplication.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n4) Register pending segment upgrade only on those tasks to which the segment is associated.\r\n\r\nIf there are N pending realtime segments and T tasks, we make O(N * T) calls today by trying to upgrade each of the N pending segments on each of the T tasks.\r\nBy checking if `task.baseSequenceName == pendingSegment.taskAllocatorId`, we can reduce this to O(N)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x]

to this patch, when canceled, workers would keep trying to contact the controller: they would attempt to report an error, and if they were in the midst of some other call (like a counters push) they would keep trying it.\r\n\r\nThis can cause cancellation to be delayed, because the controller shuts down its HTTP server before it cancels workers. Workers are then stuck retrying calls to the controller that will never succeed. The retry loops are broken when the controller gives up on them (one minute later) and exits for real. Then, the controller failure detection logic on the worker detects that the controller has failed, and the worker finally shuts down.\r\n\r\nThis patch speeds up worker cancellation by bypassing communication with the controller. There is no real need for it. If the controller canceled the workers, it isn't interested in further communications from them. If the workers were canceled out-of-band, the controller can detect this through worker monitoring and report it as a WorkerFailed error.","created_at":"2024-03-19T04:39:48Z","updated_at":"2024-05-06T08:27:12Z","closed_at":"2024-03-19T08:51:22Z","merged_at":"2024-03-19T08:51:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"8ee324c7e73ef6c64c55f0b2b93bf3e198528234","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\n`LikeDimFilter` was compiling the `LIKE` clause down to a `java.util.regex.Pattern`. Unfortunately, even seemingly simply regexes can lead to [catastrophic backtracking](https://www.regular-expressions.info/catastrophic.html). In particular, something as simple as a few `%` wildcards can end up in [exploding the time complexity](https://www.rexegg.com/regex-explosive-quantifiers.html#remote). This MR implements a simple greedy algorithm that avoids the catastrophic backtracking, converting the `LIKE` pattern into a list of `java.util.regex.Pattern` by splitting on the `%` wildcard. The resulting sub-patterns do no backtracking, and a simple greedy loop using `Matcher.find()` to progress through the string is used.\r\n\r\nRunning an updated version of the `LikeFilterBenchmark` with Java 11 on a `t2.xlarge` instance showed at least a 1.15x speed up for a simple \"contains\" query (`%50%`), and more than a 20x speed up for a \"killer\" query with four wildcards but no matches (`%%%%x`). The benchmark uses short strings: cases with longer strings should benefit more.\r\n\r\nNote that the `REGEX` operator still suffers from the same potentially-catastrophic runtimes. Using a better library than the built-in `java.util.regex.Pattern` (e.g., [joni](https://github.com/jruby/joni)) would be a good idea to avoid accidental — or intentional — DoSing.\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                      (cardinality)  Mode  Cnt  Before Score       Error      After Score     Error  Units

to match `%`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `LikeDimFilter.from()` is the most-complicated change: parsing to a list of patterns.\r\n * `LikeDimFilter.matches()` is updated to loop through the list of patterns.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-18T18:23:51Z","updated_at":"2024-04-25T15:28:13Z","closed_at":"2024-04-24T05:45:23Z","merged_at":"2024-04-24T05:45:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"4bdc1890f7d2d5b7c2b0a6bcb4792b4c64a51c95","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/56","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/56","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/56/labels","id":10627755,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Aoiqr","number":56,"title":"30.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":359,"state":"closed","created_at":"2024-03-01T18:17:04Z","updated_at":"2024-07-30T08:21:14Z","due_on":"2024-05-30T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2024-06-18T06:02:52Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/16153/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/16153/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/16153/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/5326ca4a710e9cf74d42cf2bdaac96b5fc3f7474","head":{"label":"twilliamson:timw/like-this","ref":"timw/like-this","sha":"5326ca4a710e9cf74d42cf2bdaac96b5fc3f7474","user":{"login":"twilliamson","id":330000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDAwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/330000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilliamson","html_url":"https://github.com/twilliamson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilliamson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilliamson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilliamson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilliamson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilliamson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilliamson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilliamson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilliamson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilliamson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":769813733,"node_id":"R_kgDOLeJs5Q","name":"druid","full_name":"twilliamson/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"twilliamson","id":330000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDAwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/330000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilliamson","html_url":"https://github.com/twilliamson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilliamson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilliamson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilliamson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilliamson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilliamson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilliamson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilliamson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilliamson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twilliamson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/twilliamson/druid","description":"Apache

Description:\r\nBefore this patch, `isValid()` treated empty segment IDs inconsistently.  Consider the following scenarios with each parameter to `markUsed` and `markUnused` APIs and their outcomes:\r\n\r\n1. Interval = null & segment IDs = null: Invalid\r\n2. Interval = non-null & segment IDs = []: Invalid\r\n3. Interval = non-null & segment IDs = null: Valid\r\n4. Interval = null & segment IDs = []: Invalid\r\n\r\nNote that in scenario 2, empty segment IDs are treated as the existence of the parameter. On the other hand, in scenario 4, empty segment IDs are treated as the absence of the parameter, which is confusing from an API user's perspective. \r\n\r\n### Fix:\r\nWith this patch, empty segment IDs are treated the same as null, indicating the absence of the parameter. So the outcome of scenario 2 will be Valid.\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests for the missing scenarios and updated the expectations of a couple of existing unit tests.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nFixed a bug in the `markUsed` and `markUnused` APIs where an empty set of segment IDs would be inconsistently treated as null or non-null in different scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been

PR aims to associate pending segments with the task groups that created them.\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\n\r\n1) The association facilitates clean up of unneeded pending segments as soon as all tasks in a group exit.\r\n\r\nPending segment clean up from helps delete entries immediately after tasks exit and can alleviate the load on the metadata store during segment allocations. This can also help with segment allocation failures due to conflicting pending segments that are no longer needed in some cases. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n2) This also allows a change in the way segment transactional append and replace actions to commit segments are used for concurrent append and replace.\r\n   A) When a concurrent replace occurs, it can upgrade any pending segments for concurrent append tasks to the replacing task's lock version.\r\n   B) When an appending task commits segments, it can not only commit the pending segments that it directly created but also their upgraded versions.\r\n\r\nPreviously, upgraded pending segments created by replace tasks could have different ids than the ones committed by the appending task finally. This doesn't affect batch appends.\r\nHowever for concurrent streaming ingestion, there could be a race where an upgraded pending segment on the indexer would correspond to the same root segment as the parent of a different upgraded segment committed by the job.\r\nIn such a case, there could be a brief period when the upgraded realtime segment is being served, while the committed segment with a different id is also being served on a historical. Since their ids are distinct, the broker would allow both their results to be merged leading to data dupilcation in queries.\r\n\r\nThe change in protocol ensures that an append action upgrades a segment set which corresponds exactly to the pending segment upgrades made by the concurrent replace action, and eliminates any dupilcation in query results that may occur due to the above race.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nImplementation details:\r\n\r\n```\r\nChanges to `druid_pendingSegments` metadata table:\r\n\r\ngroup_id -> task replica group id for streaming ingestion\r\n\t             index_parallel task id for native batch ingestion\r\n\t             controller id for MSQ Insert\r\n\r\nparent -> The pending segment using which the current entry was upgraded\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Pending segment clean up (Invoke on overlord directly instead of creating new task action)\r\n- When a ParallelIndexSupervisorTask or MSQController task exits, clean all pending segments associated with its id. Useful in the case of task failures\r\n- If a streaming ingestion job exits and there are no other active tasks corresponding to its base sequence name, clear all pending segments associated with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges to task actions:\r\n\r\n* SegmentAllocateAction\r\n- Associate pending segment with group_id at the time of pending segment write to metadata store. parent = self\r\n\r\n\r\n* SegmentTransactionalReplace\r\n- For a replace lock held over an interval:\r\n    transaction {\r\n      commit input segments contained within interval\r\n      upgrade ids in the upgradeSegments table corresponding to this task to the replace lock's version and commit them\r\n      fetch payload, group_id for pending segments \r\n      upgrade each such pending segment to the replace lock's version with the corresponding parent\r\n    }\r\n    For every pending segment with version == replace lock version:\r\n\tFetch payload, group_id or the pending segment and relay them to the supervisor\r\n\tThe supervisor relays the payloads to all the tasks with the corresponding group_id to serve realtime queries\r\n\r\n\r\n* SegmentTransactionalAppend\r\n- For an append lock held over an interval:\r\n    transaction {\r\n      commit input segments contained within interval\r\n      if there is an active replace lock over the interval:\r\n        add an entry for the inputSegment corresponding to the replace lock's task in the upgradeSegments table\r\n      fetch pending segments with parent contained within the input segments, and commit them\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

up to https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15994, this patch adds support for versions to the `markUsed` and `markUnused` APIs. \r\n\r\nSegments can now be marked as used or unused within the

This is the sequence of events\r\n* `CliPeon.readTask` uses Jackson to deserialize the task\r\n* Jackson uses guice to find some injectable values. One of these is `DataSourceTaskIdHolder`\r\n* To inject that value, guice decides to use the provider annotated by `CliPeon.getDataSourceFromTask` and `CliPeon.getTaskIDFromTask`.\r\n\r\nThis creates a circular ref since `readTask` is the provider for `Task` and `CliPeon.getDataSourceFromTask` and `CliPeon.getTaskIDFromTask` use `Task` as their inputs.\r\n\r\nHowever if you set any other monitor first such as `JvmMonitor`, then the injector doesn’t use the providers from `CliPeon`. Jackson is able to bind both datasource and task ID from the task file itself.\r\n\r\nFor now triggering the binding of `DataSourceTaskIdHolder` before any of the monitors are loaded resolves the issue but this does not seem like the right fix. I have not been able to figure out what the correct fix is but I suspect it's a lot deeper than this one-liner.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MetricsModule`\r\n\r\nThis PR

Description\r\n`RowSignatures.toRelDataType` did not correctly handle conversion of nested array types such as `ARRAY<ARRAY<LONG>>` etc, since the `ARRAY` handling case only checked for the primitive column types. I have modified this code to split out the `ColumnType` to `RelDataType` conversion into a new method, `RowSignatures. columnTypeToRelDataType`, and handle arrays by recursively calling this method to convert the element type to a `RelDataType` so that it can handle any type of Druid array.\r\n\r\nI kind of think this method maybe should be moved into `Calcites` since a bunch of the other conversion methods that don't involve `RowSignature` live there, but I haven't moved it yet...\r\n\r\nOnly the second added test would fail, despite just being a count(*) wrapper around the first one. Apparently this query used to run fine, but I believe the changes in #16033 which resulted in `RowSignatures.toRelDataType` started exercising this path a bit more frequently, which is how the problem was noticed.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

up to https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15994, this patch adds support for versions to the `markUsed` and `markUnused` APIs. \r\n\r\nSegments can now be marked as used or unused within the

of changes in this patch by file: \r\n\r\n#### Changes in `TestDerbyConnector`:\r\n- Introduce a static wrapper class `SegmentsTable`, which provides utilities for commonly used SQL commands for tests in `update()` and `updateUsedStatusLastUpdated()`.\r\n- Clean up references in tests to use the above new methods where applicable. For example, see usages in `SqlSegmentsMetadataManagerTest`, `IndexerSQLMetadataStorageCoordinatorTest`, `SQLMetadataConnectorTest`.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Changes in `KillUnusedSegmentsTaskTest`:\r\n- Introduce a builder class `KillUnusedSegmentsTaskBuilder` and refactor usages.\r\n- Move common segment creation to `setup()` method.\r\n- Replace usages of `Thread.sleep()` with calls to the new `updateSegmentsTable()` method.\r\n- Miscellaneous indentation adjustments based on review feedback from https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15994.\r\n\r\n#### Change in `IndexerSQLMetadataStorageCoordinator`:\r\n- Refactor some code in favor of the `verifySegmentsToCommit()` method.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-15T03:55:27Z","updated_at":"2024-05-06T08:27:29Z","closed_at":"2024-03-15T17:13:14Z","merged_at":"2024-03-15T17:13:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"3eefc477228f0999535a059bf150e4b410523b43","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":303259531,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDMyNTk1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Testing","name":"Area

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `VectorMathProcessors`\r\n * `Function`\r\n * `VectorExprSanityTest`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/16125\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis fixes an issue in which a datasource that does not have any segments loaded on historicals, cannot have its segments mark used or unused. Such a datasource may arise because all of it's segments were previously marked as unused, or if all of its segments are cold. This bug effectively did not allow a user to recover or hard-delete a datasource in this state unless they used the apis to mark ALL segments used / unused.\r\n\r\nThe issue was that there was a check that short circuits the work to mark segments used / unused if it thinks that the datasource does not exist; this check was equated to whether the datasource had any segments presently loaded on any historicals. The issue was fixed by removing this short circuit check.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nFixed bug that dissallowed marking segment by id / specific interval as used or unused if the datasource doest not have any segments loaded on historicals.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\nThis PR aims to change the behavior of the druid `lookups-cached-single` extension. In fact, we aim to introduce the option to iterate over fetched data from the `dataFetcher`. We need this in the case of `loadingLookups`, that's why these changes don't impact the `pollingLookup` feature.\r\nI also added the handling of a use case where the data exists in Druid but not in the actual data fetcher, which is in our use-case JDBC Data fetcher.\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `Support iterating over fetched data for the loadinglookups for the druid lookups-cached-single extension`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

a bug where MSQ datasketches would not downsample the sketches enough.

Description\r\n`ConcurrentGrouper` [kind of misuses `ThreadLocal` to hold a `SpillingGrouper`](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/query/groupby/epinephelinae/ConcurrentGrouper.java#L71), and never calls `remove()` on it, which can result in large amounts of heap being retained as weak references even after grouping is finished.\r\n\r\nIts kind of difficult to rework this such that we use `ThreadLocal` and actually call `remove()`, since the `ConcurrentGrouper` is created on the 'qtp' threads, but the `ThreadLocal` is set from the processing threads, so removing them from the `ThreadLocalMap` of the processing threads is a bit tricksy.\r\n\r\nPoking around in the debugger sort of shows the problem, with several 'closed' `SpillingGrouper` present in the `ThreadLocalMap` of processing threads:\r\n<img width=\"555\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-12 at 9 46 50 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/1577461/a488480a-4d11-4ebf-a3bd-bf68a9d12c5d\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThe `ThreadLocalMap` stores these all as `WeakReference`, so they should eventually be reclaimed, but it might take several GC cycles, so OOM can still occur.\r\n\r\nRather than fixing usage of `ThreadLocal` to call remove, a much lower budget way to make this less painful is for `Grouper.close()` to more aggressively free stuff up, since `ConcurrentGrouper` does call close on all of the associated `SpillingGrouper`, including those stored in the `ThreadLocalMap`. The main thing using heap as far as I can tell is the dictionaries built by the `KeySerde`, so calling `keySerde.reset()` on all of the `Grouper.close()` implementations which have a `KeySerde` should free up a bunch of space that is no longer needed.\r\n\r\nThe `RowBasedKeySerde` implementation of `reset` was missing clearing out the array dictionaries, so I also added that.\r\n\r\nI couldn't think of an easy way to write tests for this because its kind of stuffed down pretty deep, but if anyone has any ideas that aren't a ton of work I'm happy to add them.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.
