notes](https://www.joda.org/joda-time/changes-report.html#a2.12.7) for more information.\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n-   Update time zone data to 2024agtz by [@&#8203;github-actions](https://togithub.com/github-actions) in [https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/pull/768](https://togithub.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/pull/768)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/compare/v2.12.6...v2.12.7\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>google/truth (com.google.truth.extensions:truth-java8-extension)</summary>\n\n### [`v1.4.0`](https://togithub.com/google/truth/releases/tag/v1.4.0): 1.4.0\n\nIn this release, our assertions on Java 8 types continue to move from the `Truth8` class to the main `Truth` class. This change should not break compatibility for any supported JDK or Android version, even users who test under old versions of Android without [API desugaring](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring). Additionally, we will never break binary compatibility, though some users will have to make changes to their source code in order for it to compile against newer versions.\n\nThis release is likely to lead to more **build failures** than [1.3.0](https://togithub.com/google/truth/releases/tag/v1.3.0) did. However, those failures should be **straightforward to fix**.\n\n#### Example build failure\n\n    Foo.java:152: error: reference to assertThat is ambiguous\n        assertThat(repo.findFileWithName(\"foo\")).isNull();\n        ^\n      both method assertThat(@&#8203;org.jspecify.nullness.Nullable Path) in Truth8 and method assertThat(@&#8203;org.jspecify.nullness.Nullable Path) in Truth match\n\n#### Simplest upgrade strategy (if you can update all your code atomically in the same commit as the Truth upgrade)\n\nIn the same commit:\n\n1.  Upgrade Truth to 1.4.0.\n2.  Replace `import static com.google.common.truth.Truth8.assertThat;` with `import static com.google.common.truth.Truth.assertThat;`.\n    -   If you use Kotlin, replace `import com.google.common.truth.Truth8.assertThat` with `import com.google.common.truth.Truth.assertThat`.\n3.  Replace `import com.google.common.truth.Truth8;` with `import com.google.common.truth.Truth;`.\n    -   again, similarly for Kotlin if needed\n4.  Replace remaining references to `Truth8` with references to `Truth`.\n    -   For example, replace `Truth8.assertThat(optional).isPresent()` with `Truth.assertThat(optional).isPresent()`.\n\nIf you're feeling lucky, you can try this one-liner for the code updates:\n\n```sh\ngit grep -l Truth8 | xargs perl -pi -e 's/import static com.google.common.truth.Truth8.assertThat;/import static com.google.common.truth.Truth.assertThat;/g; s/import com.google.common.truth.Truth8.assertThat/import com.google.common.truth.Truth.assertThat/g; s/import com.google.common.truth.Truth8/import com.google.common.truth.Truth/g; s/\\bTruth8[.]/Truth./g;'\n```\n\nAfter that process, it is possible that you'll still see build errors from ambiguous usages of `assertThat` static imports. If so, you can find a workaround in the section about overload ambiguity in the release notes for [1.3.0](https://togithub.com/google/truth/releases/tag/v1.3.0). Alternatively, you can wait to upgrade until after a future Truth release, which will eliminate the ambiguity by changing the signatures of some `Truth.assertThat` overloads.\n\n#### Incremental upgrade strategy\n\nIf you have a very large repo or you have other reasons to prefer to upgrade incrementally, you can use the approach that we used inside Google. Roughly, that approach was:\n\n1.  Make the optional changes discussed in the release notes for [1.3.0](https://togithub.com/google/truth/releases/tag/v1.3.0).\n2.  For any remaining calls to `Truth8.assertThat`, change them to *avoid* static import.\n    -   That is, replace `assertThat(optional).isPresent()` with `Truth8.assertThat(optional).isPresent()`.\n3.  Upgrade Truth to 1.4.0.\n4.  Optionally replace references to `Truth8` with references to `Truth` (including restoring static imports if desired), as discussed in section about the simple upgrade strategy above.\n\n#### Optional additional changes\n\n-   If you use `assertWithMessage(...).about(intStreams()).that(...)`, `expect.about(optionalLongs()).that(...)`, or similar, you can remove your call to `about`. This change will never be necessary; it is just a simplification.\n    -   This is similar to a previous optional change from [1.3.0](https://togithub.com/google/truth/releases/tag/v1.3.0), except that 1.3.0 solved this problem for `streams` and `optionals`, whereas 1.4.0 solves it for the other `Truth8` types.\n\n#### For help\n\nPlease feel welcome to [open an issue](https://togithub.com/google/truth/issues/new) to report problems or request help.\n\n#### Changelog\n\n-   Added the remaining `Truth8.assertThat` overloads to the main `Truth` class. ([`9be8e77`](https://togithub.com/google/truth/commit/9be8e774c), [`1f81827`](https://togithub.com/google/truth/commit/1f81827f1))\n-   Added more `that` overloads to make it possible to write type-specific assertions when using the remaining Java 8 types.

of upload-artifact@v4 and download-artifact@v4 are major changes to the backend architecture of Artifacts. They have numerous performance and behavioral improvements.</p>\n<p>ℹ️ However, this is a major update that includes breaking changes. Artifacts created with versions v3 and below are not compatible with the v4 actions. Uploads and downloads <em>must</em> use the same major actions versions.

This rule is loosely based on the SEI CERT rule *OBJ01-J Limit accessibility of fields*. ([#OBJ01-J](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/OBJ01-J.+Limit+accessibility+of+fields))\n-   Extend `SerializableIdiom` detector with new bug type: `SE_PREVENT_EXT_OBJ_OVERWRITE`. It's reported in case of the `readExternal()` method allows any caller to reset any value of an object\n-   New Detector `FindVulnerableSecurityCheckMethods` for new bug type `VSC_VULNERABLE_SECURITY_CHECK_METHODS`. This bug is reported whenever a non-final and non-private method of a non-final class performs a security check using the `java.lang.SecurityManager`. (See \\[SEI CERT MET03-J] (https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/MET03-J.+Methods+that+perform+a+security+check+must+be+declared+private+or+final))\n-   New function added to detector `SynchronizationOnSharedBuiltinConstant`to detect `DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_INTERNED_STRING` ([#&#8203;2266](https://togithub.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/pull/2266))\n-   Make TypeQualifierResolver recognize org.apache.avro.reflect.Nullable ([#&#8203;2066](https://togithub.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/pull/2066))\n-   New detector `FindArgumentAssertions` detecting bug `ASSERTION_OF_ARGUMENTS` in case of validation of arguments of public functions using assertions (See [MET01-J.

This bug is reported whenever a new class, interface, field, method or variable is created reusing an identifier from the *Java Standard Library* . (See [SEI CERT rule DCL01-J](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/DCL01-J.+Do+not+reuse+public+identifiers+from+the+Java+Standard+Library))\n\n##### Security\n\n-   Disable access to external entities when processing XML ([#&#8203;2217](https://togithub.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/pull/2217))\n\n##### Build\n\n-   Bump Eclipse from 4.6.3 to 4.14 ([#&#8203;2314](https://togithub.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/pull/2314))\n-   Use jakarta annotation 1.3.5 instead of legacy javax annotation 1.3.2 ([#&#8203;2315](https://togithub.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/pull/2315))\n-   Change hamcrest-all to hamcrest-core as that is what was actually used and then update to 2.2 ([#&#8203;2316](https://togithub.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/pull/2316))\n-   Only run release action on 'spotbugs' and use Eclipse 4.14 ([#&#8203;2317](https://togithub.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/pull/2317))\n-   Prefer log4j2 2.20.0 ([#&#8203;2480](https://togithub.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/pull/2480))\n-   Prefer logback 1.4.8 ([#&#8203;2480](https://togithub.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/pull/2480))\n-   Prefer logback 1.4.11 ([#&#8203;2580](https://togithub.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/pull/2580))\n-   Switch junit 4 for junit 5 vintage engine ([#&#8203;2483](https://togithub.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/pull/2483))\n-   LineEndings and Spotless ([#&#8203;2343](https://togithub.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/pull/2343))\n    -   Cleanup gitattributes switching text to auto.

href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/releases\">actions/stale's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v9.0.0</h2>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Action is now stateful: If the action ends because of <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale#operations-per-run\">operations-per-run</a> then the next run will start from the first unprocessed issue skipping the issues processed during the previous run(s). The state is reset when all the issues are processed. This should be considered for scheduling workflow runs.</li>\n<li>Version 9 of this action updated the runtime to Node.js 20. All scripts are now run with Node.js 20 instead of Node.js 16 and are affected by any breaking changes between Node.js 16 and 20.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What Else Changed</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Performance
