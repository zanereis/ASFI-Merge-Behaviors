PR adds support for a few lesser-used operations that are easy to implement.\r\n\r\nSome elementwise operations:\r\n- at_time\r\n- between_time\r\n- Series.explode (this was already implemented in DataFrame)\r\n- subtract, divide (aliases for sub, div)\r\n\r\nSome aggregation functions:\r\n- sem (standard error of the mean)\r\n- mad (mean absolute deviation)\r\n- skew\r\n- kurt/kurtosis\r\n\r\nNote all of these aggregation functions are implemented as unliftable aggregations here, but I think they can all be parallelized. skew and kurtosis can take a similar appraoch to std/var (filed BEAM-12550 for this). sem and mad will require more research to find a distributed algorithm (if one exists).\r\n\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance status (on master

a useful `__repr__` is important for an API that may be used in an interactive context, as jupyter notebooks will call `__repr__` on an object when it is the output of a cell. This PR is an alternative to #15072. It adds a simplified implementation for `__repr__` that just lists critical information about the DataFrame or Series (names of columns and indexes, and dtypes for Series). \r\n\r\nThe repr for a pandas DataFrame might look like this:\r\n```\r\n     index foofoofoo barbar  bazzy zoop\r\n0        0       one      A      1    x\r\n1        1       one      B      2    y\r\n2        2       one      C      3    z\r\n3        3       two      A      4    q\r\n4        4       two      B      5    w\r\n..     ...       ...    ...    ...  ...\r\n595      1       one      B      2    y\r\n596      2       one      C      3    z\r\n597      3       two      A      4    q\r\n598      4       two      B      5    w\r\n599      5       two      C      6    t\r\n\r\n[600 rows x 5 columns]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this implementation a similar Beam DataFrame will be displayed like this:\r\n```\r\nDeferredDataFrame(columns=['foofoofoo', 'barbar', 'bazzy', 'zoop'], index=<unnamed>)\r\n```\r\n\r\nA pandas Series:\r\n```\r\n0      A\r\n1      B\r\n2      C\r\n3      A\r\n4      B\r\n      ..\r\n595    B\r\n596    C\r\n597    A\r\n598    B\r\n599    C\r\nName: barbar, Length: 600, dtype: object\r\n```\r\n\r\nA Beam DeferredSeries:\r\n```\r\nDeferredSeries(name='barbar', dtype=object, index=<unnamed>)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee additional examples in the newly added

we weren't requiring Index partitioning for `df.fillna(value=DataFrame)`, which prevented it from working correctly. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately we can't always just require index partitioning when `value` is a `DeferredFrame`, because when `value` is a `Series` it's supposed to specify the fill value for each column, not for each row. This PR works around that case using the same approach as `dot` to ensure the Series is materialized and broadcast to each partition.\r\n\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance status (on master

PR adds support for [`xs`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.xs.html) on DataFrame and Series instances. `xs` is really just a specialized filter on the index, which at first glance is trivially elementwise. However it is complicated by the fact that it raises a `KeyError` when the keyed value does not exist. In order to raise this error correctly (at execution time) in a distributed context, we need to know when we're processing the partition that _should_ contain the key. In order to do this we wrap the key in a DeferredSeries and use Index partitioning to co-locate it, thus if the key is present in a partition, we know to raise an error if it doesn't exist in the target frame.\r\n\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance status (on master branch)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <thead>\r\n    <tr>\r\n

a useful `__repr__` is important for an API that may be used in an interactive context, as jupyter notebooks will call `__repr__` on an object when it is the output of a cell. This PR adds an implementation for `__repr__` that seeks to emulate the pandas implementation, but omits the data in order to make it clear to the user that the dataframe is deferred and has not yet been materialized.\r\n\r\nThe repr for a pandas DataFrame might look like this:\r\n```\r\n     index foofoofoo barbar  bazzy zoop\r\n0        0       one      A      1    x\r\n1        1       one      B      2    y\r\n2        2       one      C      3    z\r\n3        3       two      A      4    q\r\n4        4       two      B      5    w\r\n..     ...       ...    ...    ...  ...\r\n595      1       one      B      2    y\r\n596      2       one      C      3    z\r\n597      3       two      A      4    q\r\n598      4       two      B      5    w\r\n599      5       two      C      6    t\r\n\r\n[600 rows x 5 columns]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this implementation a similar Beam DataFrame will be displayed like this:\r\n```\r\n  index foofoofoo barbar bazzy zoop\r\n:     :         :      :     :    :\r\n:     :         :      :     :    :\r\n\r\n[?? rows x 5 columns]\r\n```\r\n\r\nA pandas Series:\r\n```\r\n0      A\r\n1      B\r\n2      C\r\n3      A\r\n4      B\r\n      ..\r\n595    B\r\n596    C\r\n597    A\r\n598    B\r\n599    C\r\nName: barbar, Length: 600, dtype: object\r\n```\r\n\r\nA Beam DeferredSeries:\r\n```\r\n: :\r\n: :\r\nName: barbar, Length: ??, dtype: object\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote there's quite a bit of complexity in the implementation in order to deal with column and index names (and names for multiple levels of columns), as well as justification. Tests are added in frames_test.py::ReprTest to verify these cases.\r\n\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance status (on master

This extension for JdbcIO supports parallel loading from JDBC sources with a query splitting mechanism. The user needs to specify a field for splitting the query, the range for values in this field, and the degree of parallelism. JdbcIO opens multiple connections to the database using split queries.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

current SpannerIO creates transaction at the beginning of pipeline run. This causes SpannerIO error by session not found if the pipeline runs long with `ReadAll` which gets `ReadOperation` as input . \r\n\r\nThis change introduces a delayed transaction creation. It makes a pipeline able to create Spanner transaction when it is needed (e.g. just before ReadAll). \r\n\r\nTake a look at the code below with this change applied. It will creates a transaction session after `readOperations` is finished. FYI, the code will fail to compile with the current SpannerIO because `CreateTransaction` only accepts `PBegin` at the moement.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSpannerConfig config = ...\r\n\r\nPCollection<ReadOperation> readOperations = ...\r\n\r\nPCollectionView<Transaction> transaction = readOperations.apply(SpannerIO.createTransaction());\r\n\r\nPCollection<Struct> users = readOperations\r\n  .apply(SpannerIO.readAll().withSpannerConfig(config).withTransaction(transaction))\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a new script that populates a postgresql table with status of the Java and Python GitHub Actions.\r\nThe data in that table is in turn consumed by a Grafana json file to display the aforementioned status of each testing job within the Java and Python GAs.\r\nThe goal is to have more data that will allow us to discern among failing and flaky tests.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank

behavior of PubsubIO is to ignore parsing errors, relying on Pub/Sub dead-letter configuration to eventually send the message to a dead-letter topic. However, the message sent to the dead-letter topic loses all info on the error (though error logs should exist). Since parsing errors are also unlikely transient, it wastes a lot of resources with retries, and it can lead to infinite retry loops if no dead-letter is set up. This PR attempts to mitigate these issues by allow PubsubIO.Read to be configured with a dead-letter topic.\r\n\r\nTo avoid some messiness with the `ExceptionAsMapHandler`, I added a handler to `WithFailures` that just returns the exception. This also requires a new wrapper around `Throwable` to override the default `equals` implementation. Otherwise, we'd get a ton of log spam about the coder mutating the exception.\r\n\r\nPubsubTestClient also needed to be updated to support testing this feature.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

discovered this bug when testing with pandas 1.3.0rc1. Due to https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/36470 `groupby(dropna=False)` doesn't work when grouping on a MultiIndex, which unfortunately is always the case for us when grouping on multiple columns.
