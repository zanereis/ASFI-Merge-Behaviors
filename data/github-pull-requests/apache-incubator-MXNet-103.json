accuracy are 0.9309 and 0.9303 in this patch and Kaiming He's paper, respectively.\nThe accuracy is the best one of the last 3 epochs (0.930288, 0.930889 and 0.929587), while the original paper select the best one in 5 runs. The dockerfile and log are in: https://gist.github.com/Answeror/f9160145e1c64bb509f52c00014bdb77\n\nThe only difference between this patch and Facebook's implementation (https://github.com/gcr/torch-residual-networks and https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch) are:\n1. The kernel of shortcut with downsampling is 2x2 rather than 1x1. I can't reproduce this accuracy with 1x1 kernel. Note the shortcut does not contain learnable parameters.\n2. I use a BatchNorm after data layer to simulate z-score normalization. Although subtract (127, 127, 127) and divide 60 works equally well.\n\nSome details affect the accuracy:\n1. Z-score normalization of the input.\n2. Weight decay of all parameters (weight, bias, gamma, beta). See comments in `train_cifar10_resnet.py`for details.\n3. Nesterov momentum\n4. `fix_gamma=False` in BatchNorm (gamma is necessary because of the weight decay of the conv weight)\n5. Initialization\n6. 4 pixel padding\n\nAnd thanks #1230 (@freesouls) and #1041 (@shuokay) to provide preliminary implementations.\n## update@2016-06-08\n\nWith #2366 and a batch size of 64, I got an accuracy of 0.939704 after 200 epochs on 2 GPUs.\nNote, **the accuracy is strongly affected by the batch size**, the more GPU you use, the smaller batch size should be.\nSee https://gist.github.com/Answeror/f9160145e1c64bb509f52c00014bdb77#file-resnet-dual-gpu-log for the full

already have the ability to define symbolic operators in Python. But due to multi-threading issue, this feature cause a lot of pain to implement in other languages like Julia (e.g. dmlc/MXNet.jl#16). With the new module system, we can achieve similar thing (at least for the case of simple linear chaining) by defining a loss module directly in Python.\n\nThis PR is a simple demo of defining a multiclass-hinge loss and train on MNIST.\n\nLater on (???) I will try to port the module system to Julia.\n","created_at":"2016-04-15T20:24:52Z","updated_at":"2016-04-16T05:02:03Z","closed_at":"2016-04-16T05:02:03Z","merged_at":"2016-04-16T05:02:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"ec8302bd860f3e5c4b24ee17242f7b7fdc35fb87","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/1868/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/1868/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1868/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/aa3747de11d83d29fe45418a6e78eb01b48a34c0","head":{"label":"pluskid:container","ref":"container","sha":"aa3747de11d83d29fe45418a6e78eb01b48a34c0","user":{"login":"pluskid","id":3542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid","html_url":"https://github.com/pluskid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"5bdf8d4da33e55b518705d522e6a7810355e486d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

multiple modules.\n\nIs there any easy way to tell whether a `Symbol` contains a loss function? Currently I am asking the user to explicitly specify `take_labels=True`.\n\nBTW: @tqchen While running the example `sequential_module.py`, I run into the following segfaults. However, when I re-run it, I cannot reproduce it again. Do you have anything in mind what/where might be some potential bug here?

PR add simplified operator registration that registers functions into both imperative and symbolic API. This PR **_does not**_ change the operator API, instead, it provides a wrapper layer to make registration to the current API easier for some simple functions.\n\nSee https://github.com/tqchen/mxnet/blob/master/include/mxnet/operator_util.h for the library.\nThis is a plugin on top of existing registration API, to register special functions.\n## Supported functions\n- Unary functions\n- Binary functions\n- All functions allow additional scalar argument, or keyword argument.\n## How to Use\n- Register a forward function\n- Optionally register a gradient function\n- Optionally register a shape inference function when shape relation is complicated\n\nSee https://github.com/tqchen/mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/elementwise_unary_op-inl.h#L83 for examples.\n## Current Status\n\nThis refactor removed old tblob functions to operator_util.h and enhanced it to support more function types. The old implementation of unary functions are moved to operator folder\n## Guideline for Next Step\n\nThese can be in a seperate PR\n- The old registration interface remains the same and always works\n- When possible, use the simple op interface, which allows one definition for both API.\n- Let us also work on migrating some of the old operators to simple op interface.\n","created_at":"2016-04-13T05:56:55Z","updated_at":"2016-04-14T20:32:07Z","closed_at":"2016-04-14T20:32:07Z","merged_at":"2016-04-14T20:32:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"2a7626a54c41e75abfc71efe789b1a93840936d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/1839/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/1839/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1839/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/0992e7d7f23e1c12a8283fc83daaf2efc7df56c8","head":{"label":"tqchen:master","ref":"master","sha":"0992e7d7f23e1c12a8283fc83daaf2efc7df56c8","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42364986,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjM2NDk4Ng==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"tqchen/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen/mxnet","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/
