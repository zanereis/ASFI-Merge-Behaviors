change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nA saved Sankey chart query context has the `source` and `target` columns in the `groupby` field:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n{\r\n    \"queries\": [\r\n        {\r\n            ...\r\n            \"columns\": [],\r\n            \"metrics\": [\"count\"],\r\n            \"groupby\": [\"bot_id\", \"channel_id\"],  # here\r\n         },\r\n    ],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the query context from the same chart, when embedded, looks like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n{\r\n    \"queries\": [\r\n        {\r\n            ...\r\n            \"columns\": [\"bot_id\", \"channel_id\"],\r\n            \"metrics\": [\"count\"],\r\n            # no \"groupby\" key\r\n         },\r\n    ],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the `query_context_modified` function to account for this case.\r\n\r\nNote that this approach is a short term solution to unblock 4.1. I think two better (but more complext) solutions would be:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure the query object from an unmodified chart in a dashboard always matches the stored query object.\r\n2. Even better: dashboards should send the chart ID and any native filters, instead of sending the whole payload for the chart. This would prevent maliciously modifying requests over the wire.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/30205\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.3.3</h2>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a breaking change introduced with color modes where it was required to manually import <code>variables-dark.scss</code> when building Bootstrap with Sass. Now, <code>_variables.scss</code> will automatically import <code>_variables-dark.scss</code>.

SUMMARY\r\nThe Jinja `{{metric()}}` macro allows you to retrieve the corresponding SQL for a metric by using its `key`, and optionally the dataset ID. When the dataset ID is not specified, it should be automatically retrieved from the context (based on the current dataset). \r\n\r\nThis PR improves the logic to retrieve this value from other places:\r\n* It was not possible to use the Drill By option in a chart that had this macro without the dataset ID\r\n* It was not possible to export a chart using this macro without a specified dataset ID to Excel/CSV\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n**Drill By**\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23e3a52b-7497-46dd-87d2-580d9cce0b10)\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00c26856-f082-4206-8798-56fde62fc4d2)\r\n\r\n**CSV/Excel Export**\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ef6af2b-43ce-4d58-8eb0-b5306d1517f2)\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\nUser prompted to download the file\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nTests updated accordingly. For manual testing:\r\n1. Create a Pie Chart using this macro and a dimension. \r\n2. Save it to a dashboard.\r\n3. Access the dashboard and Drill By on a dimension with any other column.\r\n4. Then try exporting the chart to Excel.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow

slightly different from the logic in PRs.\r\n\r\nOn my latest try, I had an error related to a combination of retries in the context where the dashboard is used.

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWhen in scope (global or specific) charts that are not applicable to the filter (do not share the same datasource or columns) were being applied anyway, causing unnecessary queries. This PR checks that the charts have columns in common or will exclude the charts.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe58ccbc-b689-4470-a85d-a8b494e9633c\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a45c284-ac44-4f4e-960b-e66c0c5ed46d\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a native filter that has no common columns with a chart\r\n2. Add the chart in scope\r\n3. Apply the filter\r\n4. The chart should not reload and emit a query\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

stop\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently, when executing an Impala query in SQL Lab, clicking the cancel button only cancels the query in Superset, but the query is not canceled on the Impala side, and the resources are not released.\r\nThis commit resolves the issue by ensuring that when an Impala query is canceled in SQL Lab, the query is also canceled on the Impala side, achieving the goal of releasing resources.\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24969 introduced the `@transaction` decorator, to be used in commands to ensure that commits are explicit and happen only once in the lifetime of a request, preventing eagers commits. The PR failed to catch a few cases where legacy API endpoints were not using commands, resulting in successful requests that wouldn't be persisted to the database. These were fixed in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/30215.\r\n\r\nWhy did our integration tests fail to catch these endpoints that were not committing? Tests failed because by default SQLAlchemy will autoflush before running a `SELECT`. In real world, favoriting a chart and verifying that it was favorited are two separate requests. If the first one fails to commit, the second one won't see a change. But our integration tests share the same global session (`db.session`), so that an insert followed by a select will result in flush between them, and the non-committed data will be seen even though we use `READ COMMITTED` as the isolation level.\r\n\r\nTo prevent this from happening again, this PR turns off the autoflush in the integration tests.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where the X-Axis Sort By control was disappearing when a custom SQL was being used as an x-axis. Given that we currently have no way to identify the result type of a custom SQL, we make the control available and give the responsibility to the user to provide a sortable result. We implement the same behavior for the Time Grain control as you can see in the recordings.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes an issue with pre-query normalization when dealing with custom SQL. Previously, a custom SQL that had a label that does not match any column name would throw the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsuperset/superset/connectors/sqla/models.py\", line 1691, in _normalize_prequery_result_type\r\n    column_ = columns_by_name[dimension]\r\nKeyError: 'custom_sql'\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven function docs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nConvert a prequery result type to its equivalent Python type.\r\n\r\nSome databases like Druid will return timestamps as strings, but do not perform\r\nautomatic casting when comparing these strings to a timestamp. For cases like\r\nthis we convert the value via the appropriate SQL transform.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe simply skip the conversion of custom SQL types as we cannot determine if they are temporal or not currently.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6191c06-2d78-43a9-8d08-334453ca78d2\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nRepro the steps

SUMMARY\r\nIf a viewer is not logged in, or they are the public/anonymous user, and they click a link that takes them to a Superset dashboard that is _not_ public, they are currently told \"You don't have access\" and sent to the list of dashboards, where they will see only public ones listed.  This is often misleading: in most cases, the problem is not that they don't have access -- they just need to log in.\r\n\r\nAfter the PR, such cases are routed to the login screen, and after a successful login the users are sent back to the dashboard they were trying to access.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/053bbf0e-a2f5-4e2b-8498-47694ff213a6\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc78d404-0d63-4512-9ec4-c1e813b7a66b\r\n\r\nnote I've changed the error message since recording this\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCreate a dashboard with restricted access, try to view it while not logged in.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\nImplements this feature request: https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/22190 \r\nReplaces this stale PR: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23280\r\n\r\nI have the DASHBOARD_RBAC flag enabled as well as the Public role in use.  My code alterations are minimal so I don't think it will negatively affect deployments that differ from mine, but it would be good to have someone check.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to write tests for this but am open to it if someone can advise.","created_at":"2024-09-24T20:44:16Z","updated_at":"2024-09-25T18:27:53Z","closed_at":"2024-09-25T18:26:26Z","merged_at":"2024-09-25T18:26:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"69d5f766a89005529c197c2e5424a59ada7a8b68","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1330950144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMwOTUwMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/S","name":"size/S","color":"C8B6FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2625418104,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjI1NDE4MTA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/authentication","name":"authentication","color":"d4e2d4","default":false,"description":"Related

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAt Pinterest we were trying to use the `get_or_create` endpoint to automate the integration between our MetricsLayer and Superset. During our tests we've encountered the following issue: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/30377\r\n\r\nThe issue happens because at the moment the `get_or_create` code does not account for the payload `schema` attribute, doing a search by `table_name` only.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `get_or_create` to take the `schema` into account:\r\n\r\n* A new `get_table_by_schema_and_name` was added to the `DatasetDAO` class\r\n* `get_or_create` now checks if the dataset exists by calling `DatasetDAO.get_table_by_schema_and_name` (instead of `DatasetDAO.get_table_by_name`)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n- Integration tests were added for the new behaviour\r\n- Manual tests: reproducing the steps described on the issue\r\n\r\n**Case 1 - False Positive**\r\n\r\n1. Go to the datasets page\r\n2. Pick any existing dataset name and prepare a payload as follows (example using the `users` datasets)\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  'table_name': 'users',\r\n  'schema': 'other',\r\n  'database_id': 1,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Submit this payload via a POST request to /api/v1/dataset/get_or_create\r\n4. A new dataset is created. The API returns with a `200` pointing to the new dataset. No false positives anymore.\r\n\r\n**Case 2 - Internal Server Error**\r\n\r\n1. Create 2 or more datasets with the same `table_name` and different `schemas` (either via UI or create dataset API)\r\n2. Try to create a new dataset. Again, with same `table_name` but a different schema. Payload example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  'table_name': 'users',\r\n  'schema': 'any_new_schema_name',\r\n  'database_id': 1,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Submit this payload via a POST request to /api/v1/dataset/get_or_create\r\n4. A new dataset is created. The API returns with a `200` pointing to the new dataset. No 500 errors anymore.\r\n\r\n**Backward Compatibility**\r\n\r\n1. Go to the datasets page\r\n2. Pick any existing dataset name and prepare a payload as follows (without passing the schema)\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  'table_name': 'users',\r\n  'database_id': 1,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Submit this payload via a POST request to /api/v1/dataset/get_or_create\r\n4. No new dataset is created. The API returns with a `200` with the response body pointing to the existing dataset.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWe're currently not logging flask warnings to the logger as part of the \"catch all\" @safe or @handle_api_exception decorators. I think @handle_api_exception does a more thorough job of catching different errors and handling, logging, raising, etc. We're applying @handle_api_exception on most base restapi functions, but using @safe on the adhoc apis. Maybe we can look at combining these and only having one decorator. I also removed the exception handling in the api because they will be caught and handled in the decorator. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently, if you delete a dataset, the charts that were using it don't keep the controls config when swapping to a dataset that have similar structure.\r\nThis is because the state gets overwritten with form data that doesn't have the controls configs so the sync method is not able to fetch the correct values for them.\r\n\r\nThis PR keeps the values and other configs when the API response doesn't include dataset id (deleted) and fallback to read from the datasource when getting the controls values in case there's nothing in the state.\r\n\r\nOne thing to notice is that before, when you first loaded a chart that have no dataset because it was deleted, the explore data was a fallback and didn't trigger the API requests, now, because we're not using this fallback explore but keeping the form data info from the API response, the UI will show a `Not Found` error until you swap the dataset and update the chart.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCreate two datasets with the same schema (columns and metrics).\r\nCreate a chart using one of these and save it.\r\nDelete this dataset.\r\nAccess the chart -- you'll see an option to swap the dataset.\r\nRemap the chart to use the other dataset.\r\nYour controls config must be kept\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

options for radar chart (defining `max` values) were not being displayed.\r\n- There was no option to define a `min` value for each metric, which makes it impossible to have radial lines with the same value for each metric (vertex).\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1954\" alt=\"Captura de ecrã 2024-09-20, às 16 06 43\"

in the dark, but I saw that some Jest tests were failing due to Javascript running out of heap memory (see screenshot).\r\nMy _conjecture_ is that the Native Filter tests we're struggling with are the same issue we're running into here.\r\n\r\nSo... let's throw a dart at the problem. Apparently, the default size is 1.5GB, so let's go to 4! GPT thinks this'll work for both jest, and the chrome/chromium browser we use in E2E tests, so here goes nothing! Apparently the small GH action runners have 7GB ram, so this seems reasonable-ish.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n<img width=\"1155\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 3 53 47 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fed0d3c-1c9a-4625-81b3-782d47023747\">\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nIf CI passes, we should be good. \r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27470 modified the logic to validate a SQL Lab query by checking the access permission before any Jinja rendering occurs as some Jinja macros execute statements upon rendering.

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nDigest generation for charts and dashboards wasn't considering RLS for users and guest users (via Embedded). This PR includes the RLS in the hash generation for the digest. The digest is included in cache keys and will be updated according to the RLS rules. Previously you could generate a screenshot and any RLS applied later won't be applied to follow-up screenshots as the same cache key was being reused.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN.A.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Generate a screenshot of a Dashboard\r\n2. Add RLS rules for the current user\r\n3. Generate the screenshot again\r\n4. The screenshot should present the Dashboard with RLS rules applied\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\n`Table` chart was removing the `extras` from the summary query, assuming they were only used for time grains. This PR fixes that and put the extras back in the queryObject sent as payload, now, only excluding `time_grain_sqla` if no temporal column is included in your chart.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: Excluding extras from summary query and only adding it if no time comparison was used\r\n<img width=\"1898\" alt=\"before\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbba5471-45d1-4431-a113-e75a80df3e7d\">\r\n\r\nNow: Sending extras in the total query regardless you're using time comparison\r\nNo temporal Column\r\n<img width=\"1898\" alt=\"now_no_temp\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce1f9c9e-e33b-43c7-b892-e2ba2ba12c7b\">\r\nWith temporal Column\r\n<img width=\"1898\" alt=\"now_temp\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f50441a-2c26-4885-b6d3-0e551d2c3079\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a `Table` Chart\r\n2. Use no temporal column and a custom SQL filter\r\n3. Mark the `Show summary` checkbox\r\n4. The queries sent as payload must include the `where` in extras for both queries and not include a `time_grain_sqla`\r\n5. Now add a temporal column to your chart and run the query again\r\n6. The `time_grain_sqla` must be present in the extras alongside with the `where` clause\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

SUMMARY\r\nA continuation on #30142, making it possible to format `from_expr` and `to_expr` using `datetime.strftime`. This is handy if the target column is string based using a custom format, like `YYYY-MM-DD`, which tends to be the typical partitioning scheme, and we want to avoid having to cast the column to a temporal type.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n\r\nNow you can format like this (assuming `my_date` is a `VARCHAR` with `YYYY-MM-DD`):\r\n```python\r\n{% set time_filter = get_time_filter(strftime=\"%y-%m-%d\") %}\r\n{% set from_expr = time_filter.from_expr %}\r\n{% set to_expr = time_filter.to_expr %}\r\nSELECT\r\n...\r\n{% if from_expr or to_expr %}WHERE 1 = 1\r\n{% if from_expr %}AND my_date >= '{{ from_expr }}'{% endif %}\r\n{% if to_expr %}AND my_date < '{{ to_expr }}'{% endif %}\r\n{% endif %}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will render\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT\r\n  ...\r\nWHERE 1 = 1\r\nAND my_date >= '2024-08-03'\r\nAND my_date < '2024-09-03'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!
