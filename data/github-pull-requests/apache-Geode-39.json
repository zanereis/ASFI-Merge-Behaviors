of geode-log4j widened a race condition in GfshRule in which\r\nthe process being forked would start printing output before the\r\nProcessLogger had been created and started in order to intercept that\r\noutput.\r\n\r\nThe widening of that race condition resulted in CI failures of\r\nConnectCommandAcceptanceTest.\r\n\r\nProcessLogger does not appear to have any real need for manipulating\r\nlog4j-core which is what widens the race condition far enough to fail\r\nin CI.\r\n\r\nRemoving the manipulation of log4j-core from ProcessLogger reduces\r\nthe race condition for consistent passing. The window itself is still\r\nthere but without resorting to something like MainLauncher [1], there's\r\nno way to completely close the window.\r\n\r\n[1] geode-junit:

9ffdd321f2471795ba7d6dc8b512852352b59ad6\r\nAuthor: Kirk Lund <klund@apache.org>\r\nDate:   Thu Aug 8 15:17:54 2019 -0700\r\n\r\n    GEODE-6964: Move geode log4j core classes to geode-log4j\r\n    \r\n    Introduce new Logging and Alerting SPIs. Extract all log4j-core code to\r\n    geode-log4j module.\r\n    \r\n    The geode-core module no longer contains log4j2.xml and no longer has a\r\n    dependency on log4j-core.\r\n    \r\n    All code that uses log4j-core has moved to the new module geode-log4j.\r\n    The log4j2.xml for Geode now lives in geode-log4j as well. These\r\n    changes ensure that users have better control over logging including\r\n    which backend to use. This should improve user experience when using\r\n    Spring Boot.\r\n    \r\n    Co-authored-by: Mark Hanson <mhanson@pivotal.io>\r\n```\r\n2)  [GEODE-7152: Send alert messages using executor](https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/4075/commits/24a4b5ec01a343d90ab5a6515fe011d3d232485c)\r\n```\r\ncommit 24a4b5ec01a343d90ab5a6515fe011d3d232485c\r\nAuthor: Kirk Lund <klund@apache.org>\r\nDate:   Tue Sep 17 10:39:05 2019 -0700\r\n\r\n    GEODE-7152: Send alert messages using executor\r\n    \r\n    AlertAppender uses a ThreadLocal to prevent recursive calls from\r\n    actually doing anything. However, a recent upgrade to our log4j\r\n    dependencies seems to have changed the behavior such that log4j refuses\r\n    to invoke doAppend if the thread is currently handling a sendAlert\r\n    initiated from doAppend. To fix this bug, sendAlert must be async.\r\n```","created_at":"2019-09-19T22:57:07Z","updated_at":"2019-10-18T20:10:34Z","closed_at":"2019-09-24T16:17:55Z","merged_at":"2019-09-24T16:17:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"dffcb9446aef09c7bf6e626121f4d2ec5c74586f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jdeppe-pivotal","id":5313410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTM0MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5313410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/jdeppe-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"demery-pivotal","id":45369324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzY5MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45369324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mhansonp","id":26558973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTU4OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26558973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp","html_url":"https://github.com/mhansonp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/4075/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/4075/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/4075/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/d7b14bb33e3d0520a5e92752cd9511e945aab1cb","head":{"label":"kirklund:GEODE-6964-geode-log4j-submodule-pr-2","ref":"GEODE-6964-geode-log4j-submodule-pr-2","sha":"d7b14bb33e3d0520a5e92752cd9511e945aab1cb","user":{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58218609,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODIxODYwOQ==","name":"geode","full_name":"kirklund/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":

session responsibilities are starting to appear in too many parts of Geode. This change encapsulates those responsibilities into a single class.\r\n\r\nThis PR is currently a draft because a few questions remain about what errors to log and how to log them. See the TODOs in `CompositeCacheMetricsSession`.\r\n\r\n- Add `CacheMetricsSession` interface\r\n  - Extends `MetricsSession` (as used by metrics publishing services)\r\n  - Adds methods for use by `GemFireCacheImpl` and `InternalDistributedSystem`\r\n\r\n- Add `CompositeCacheMetricsSession`\r\n  - Implements `CacheMetricsSession`\r\n  - Maintains the list of \"user registries\" added via the cache builder\r\n  - Creates a `CompositeMeterRegistry` when the cache starts\r\n  - Configures the composite registry\r\n    - Adds common tags that describe the system\r\n    - Adds standard meters that measure JVM and process quantities\r\n    - Adds user registries to the composite\r\n  - Discovers, starts, and stops metrics publishing services\r\n  - Adds and removes sub-registries as instructed by publishing services\r\n  - Forwards the current session's user registries to the incoming cache builder during reconnect\r\n  - When stopped, frees the resources it allocated\r\n\r\n- Add `CacheMetricsSessionFactory` functional interface\r\n  - `CompositeCacheMetricsSession` constructor suffices as an  implementation\r\n\r\n- `InternalCacheBuilder` no longer constructs objects on behalf of the metrics session\r\n    - Instead, it simply creates a `CompositeCacheMetricsSession`, passing\r\n      it the gathered list of user registries\r\n\r\n- `GemFireCacheImpl` …\r\n  - No longer knows about user registries\r\n  - Holds a `CacheMetricsSession` from which it gets the cache's meter registry\r\n  - Starts the metrics session when the cache opens, and stops it when the cache closes\r\n\r\n- `InternalDistributedSystem` no longer knows about user registries\r\n  - Instead, it holds a `CacheMetricsSession` that can prepare the incoming cache builder during restart\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

delegating build/run actions to IntelliJ instead of Gradle, IntelliJ 2019 fails to build geode with an error like \"output path not specified for modules...\". I was able to reproduce this issue on IntelliJ IDEA CE versions 2019.1.4 and 2019.2.1 (see JIRA ticket for details). The issue seems to occur when IntelliJ imports Gradle sub-projects as modules that have \"Use module compile output path\" checked but don't have an Output path specified.\r\n\r\nThe best solution I've found involves 2 parts. I tested this on both versions of IntelliJ 2019.\r\n1. Set the Project compiler output as shown in this SO answer: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/40675201>.\r\n2. Add `inheritOutputDirs = true` to the idea plugin configuration in `ide.gradle`. This causes IntelliJ to import gradle sub-projects with the \"Inherit project compile output path\" option checked by default. You may need to reimport gradle projects after making this change if you do not have auto-import enabled.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses part 2 above. Part 1 has to be addressed manually as far as I'm aware. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GEODE/Move+membership+code+to+a+separate+gradle+sub-project\r\n\r\nDataSerializableFixedID is used by most internal classes for\r\nserialization.  Membership, in particular, was constrained in its\r\nimplementation to use only \"fixed\" serialization identifiers because our\r\nother serialization mechanisms (DataSerialiable, PDX) are dependent on\r\nmembership and messaging.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves serialization of DataSerializableFixedID to a new\r\nsub-project, geode-serialization in support of also separating\r\nmembership into its own sub-project.\r\n\r\nMany files are touched by this PR.  The vast majority are due to a\r\nchange in the serialization interface that introduces a new parameter in\r\nDataSerializableFixedID's toData and fromData methods.  This parameter\r\ngives access to the serializer and to the Version of the\r\nsource/destination.  This parameter was added to begin moving from a\r\n\"static\" based serialization service to an instance based service.\r\n\r\nSerialization code concerning \"DSFID\"s has been moved from\r\nInternalDataSerializer to the new class DSFIDSerialzerImpl.\r\nInternalDataSerializer holds on to an instance of this class and\r\ndelegates DSFID serialization to it.\r\n\r\nInternalDataSerializer also effects registration of Geode's DSFID\r\nclasses with this serializer.  Membership \"Services\" handles\r\nregistration of its own DSFID classes with the service, as do other\r\nsub-projects like geode-web.\r\n\r\nHeapDataOutputStream has been used by most of our serialization code to\r\nprovide a DataOutput for our toData methods.  Over the years this class\r\nhas accumulated a lot of adornments for PDX serialization that aren't\r\nappropriate for a geode-serialization sub-project.  Consequently I've\r\nmoved much of its code into a superclass, BufferDataOutputStream, that\r\nprovides most of its functionality w/o needing to reference other geode-\r\ncore classes.\r\n\r\nVersion.java has been repackaged in this PR, moving it into a\r\n\"serialization\" package.  This affected some rolling-upgrade and\r\nbackward-compatibility tests that were referring to\r\nVersion.CURRENT_ORDINAL.  These have been modified to get the \"current\r\nversion ordinal\" from VersionManager.\r\n\r\nFinally, InternalDataSerializer injects a serializer into the new\r\nsub-project that provideds an API for handling other types of\r\nserializable objects like PDX.  This serializer is available in the\r\nDataSerializableFixedID toData/fromData context parameter and is used by\r\nmembership services when serializing Geode DistributionMessages.\r\n\r\nI don't think most of the files deserve scrutiny.  The primary files\r\naffected are InternalDataSerializer and DSFIDFactory and the refactoring\r\nof their code into DSFIDSerializer.  Aside from that,\r\ndoes the new SerializationContext API make sense?  Could it be improved?\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
