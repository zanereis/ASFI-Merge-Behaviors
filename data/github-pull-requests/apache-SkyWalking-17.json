Fix that `Query` cannot be updated after it's set in `SearchBuilder`\r\n- [x] Add a unit test to verify that the fix works.\r\n- [x] Explain briefly why the bug exists and how to fix it.\r\nWhen `QueryBuilder` is set in `SearchBuilder`, the following updates to `QueryBuilder` (like `queryBuilder.must(Query.term(GROUP, \"abc\")` takes no effect, because when `SearchBuilder` accepts an `QueryBuilder`, it builds a `Query` from the builder and not keep the builder itself.\r\nThis patch also fixes a serialization error of `MatchQuery`.\r\n- [x] If this pull request

Closes #7412 \r\n- [ ] Update the [`CHANGES` log](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/CHANGES.md).\r\n\r\n## New Design\r\n\r\nAfter discussion with @hanahmily and @wu-sheng , I present the following new storage plugin,\r\n\r\nThe banyanDB client sits in the `org.apache.skywalking.banyandb.client` package,\r\n\r\n1. Provide general API for query and write, which are not related to the underlying protobuf anymore,\r\n2. Provide high level client which implementes `BanyanDBService` interface,\r\n3. Also the client does not care about the schema definitions\r\n\r\nThe plugin is now decoupled from H2/JDBC and other storage plugins. For those features unimplemented yet, blank APIs are given as stubs now.\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-12T09:44:01Z","updated_at":"2021-08-13T14:13:29Z","closed_at":"2021-08-13T14:13:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f53571fcf89548dafa4449dd20dfa82244e7f3e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kezhenxu94","id":15965696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTY1Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15965696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94","html_url":"https://github.com/kezhenxu94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"hanahmily","id":1960537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjA1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1960537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily","html_url":"https://github.com/hanahmily","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/pulls/7448/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/pulls/7448/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/issues/7448/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/statuses/360972e227673571637a298526bb8610068371e6","head":{"label":"lujiajing1126:banyandb-integration-v2","ref":"banyandb-integration-v2","sha":"360972e227673571637a298526bb8610068371e6","user":{"login":"lujiajing1126","id":2568208,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjgyMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2568208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lujiajing1126","html_url":"https://github.com/lujiajing1126","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lujiajing1126/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lujiajing1126/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lujiajing1126/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lujiajing1126/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lujiajing1126/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lujiajing1126/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lujiajing1126/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lujiajing1126/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lujiajing1126/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:banyandb-integration","ref":"banyandb-integration","sha":"6a241aed758e65b54dc6225b42fc852aa878f8c7","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45721011,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTcyMTAxMQ==","name":"skywalking","full_name":"apache/skywalking
