Currently, volume state is defined by the driver in a key in `extra`. This key varies between drivers. Also, the value varies between drivers.\n2. However, it is a commonly accessed attribute that should be unified across drivers, just as `Node` state is unified in `NodeState`.\n3. This PR does exactly that.\n\nSome caveats:\n1. Except for OS and EC2, all other drivers return StorageVolume objects with state `UNKNOWN`.\n   1. I have no access to GCE.\n   2. I could find no exhaustive list of GCE disk states.\n   3. The same holds for all the other drivers.\n   4. I do not think this is a problem, because the instance variable does not currently exist at all :wink: \n\nUPDATE: GCE list is here:

shortly discussed with @Kami in #407, this patch adds support for Signature Version 4 to the `SignedAWSConnection` class. v4 will be used when a Driver-class selects `EC2V4Connection` as its `connectionCls`. In this patch this is only enabled for the the new Frankfurt region, represented by a new `EC2EUCentralNodeDriver` class. \nHaven't created any tests yet, since this is just the PoC. If this has any chance of getting merged in, I'll do the tests.\n\nI would like some feedback and thoughts on this work.\nSome questions:\n- Is this the way to go, with the Connection-classes specifying a version, and the Driver classes specifying the Connection class to use?\n- I've chosen the `pre_connect_hook` to do the work, because we need both the headers and the parameters to calculate the signature. Hope that's ok?\n- I’ve tested all regions for EC2 and all seem to work fine with the v4 authentication. I haven’t tested the only other part that uses the `SignedAWSConnection`, the `ELBConnection`, but I’m guessing that that also supports V4. It would reduce complexity if we could drop support for V2 in the SignedAWSConnection altogether. \n- The credential scope, as explained [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-create-string-to-sign.html) needs the service we are requesting. This should be just ‘ec2’ for compute service. I found no existing way to retrieve this, so I introduced a [new class variable](https://github.com/gertjanol/libcloud/blob/34933f90a87cd83429b04aecfbd0e37f63f105f2/libcloud/compute/drivers/ec2.py#L1707) in the `EC2Connection`. I don’t like this, so maybe there is a better way?\n- This patch now only works for GET-requests, but the EC2-driver doesn't use anything else. I think S3 uses other methods, but seems to have its own authentication routines. Why is that? Should I take other methods into consideration here?\n- Performance of calculating this signature sucks :(. Haven't done any measuring, but v2 seems way faster.\n","created_at":"2015-02-02T14:48:16Z","updated_at":"2015-03-28T14:51:28Z","closed_at":"2015-03-28T14:51:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"55db14460346291ca24dddc6c205e2f0d4e5f55c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/444/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/444/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/444/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/34933f90a87cd83429b04aecfbd0e37f63f105f2","head":{"label":"gertjanol:aws-signature-v4","ref":"aws-signature-v4","sha":"34933f90a87cd83429b04aecfbd0e37f63f105f2","user":{"login":"gertjanol","id":1446863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gertjanol","html_url":"https://github.com/gertjanol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gertjanol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gertjanol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gertjanol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gertjanol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gertjanol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gertjanol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gertjanol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gertjanol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gertjanol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26680373,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjY4MDM3Mw==","name":"libcloud","full_name":"gertjanol/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gertjanol","id":1446863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDY4NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1446863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gertjanol","html_url":"https://github.com/gertjanol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gertjanol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gertjanol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gertjanol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gertjanol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gertjanol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gertjanol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gertjanol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gertjanol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gertjanol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gertjanol/libcloud","description":"Apache

now supports node (instance) stop/start.  This PR adds the two new driver methods and supporting tests to include these new features.  Note that these methods only return a boolean, so the node object must be queried again to get the new status.  For example,\n\n``` python\n>>> node = gce_driver.ex_get_node('foo', 'us-central1-f')\n>>> print node.extra['status']\nu'RUNNING'\n>>> gce_driver.stop_node(node)\n>>> node = gce_driver.ex_get_node('foo', 'us-central1-f')\n>>> print node.extra['status']\nu'TERMINATED'\n```\n\nNote that the correct state for a stopped node is TERMINATED.\n\nUpstream docs are at:\nhttps://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances#stopping_an_instance\nhttps://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances#restarting_a_stopped_instance\n\n/cc @Kami - I'd like to get this into the next release if you're OK with that.\n","created_at":"2015-01-30T22:36:01Z","updated_at":"2015-02-03T13:52:54Z","closed_at":"2015-02-02T18:10:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e75a34e27c74dc160f404e9f0263076f831aa99c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/442/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/442/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/442/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/7e5699b984a56a7ffc506a97684a709738ae7045","head":{"label":"erjohnso:gce_stop_start","ref":"gce_stop_start","sha":"7e5699b984a56a7ffc506a97684a709738ae7045","user":{"login":"erjohnso","id":2154049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTQwNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2154049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso","html_url":"https://github.com/erjohnso","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19585768,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTU4NTc2OA==","name":"libcloud","full_name":"erjohnso/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"erjohnso","id":2154049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTQwNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2154049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso","html_url":"https://github.com/erjohnso","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/erjohnso/libcloud","description":"Apache
