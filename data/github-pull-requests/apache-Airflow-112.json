The JSON has the following structure: `[{\"task_id\": \"my_task\", \"value\": \"foo\"}, {\"task_id\": \"another_task\", \"key\": \"custom_key\", \"value\": 42}]`, which allows user to work both with the cases of the implicit XCom used by the Task Flow API (i.e., `xcom_key == \"return_value\"`) and of the XCom args with the custom keys (e.g., manually pushed and / or used in the templated kwargs). If `\"key\"` is omitted for any of the XCom object, `\"return_value\"` is used for it by default. The format of the passed argument is validated with the corresponding JSON schema.\r\n\r\nHence, a full CLI call may look like: \r\n\r\n`airflow tasks test example_passing_xcoms_via_test_command python_echo --xcoms [{\"task_id\": \"get_python_echo_message\", \"value\": \"test xcom arg\"}]`\r\n\r\nor  \r\n\r\n`airflow tasks test example_passing_xcoms_via_test_command run_bash --xcoms [{\"task_id\": \"get_bash_command\", \"key\": \"return_value\", \"value\": \"echo \\'test bash\\'\"}]`\r\n\r\nIf a user misses any XCom args in their call, they'll be able to see a message like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nairflow.exceptions.AirflowException: The task 'python_echo' is dependent on XComs passed from the upstream tasks. The following XComs are currently missed: [{\"task_id\": \"get_python_echo_message\", \"key\": \"return_value\"}]. Please, pass them via the --xcoms argument (see --help for more details).\r\n```\r\n\r\ncloses: #28287\r\ncloses:

If both configurations use default value, the default 512 of `max_tis_per_query` is never used.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, default will set ``scheduler.max_tis_per_query=16`` and ``core.parallelism=32``. This will make the executor can be populated in two iteration of scheduler main loop.\r\n\r\nThe actual change applied in Airflow runtime by this PR is to reduce the ``max_tis`` from 32 to 16. The query batch size reduced. This can help scheduler finish the iteration faster. Thus make scheduler more responsive and healthy. \r\n\r\nThis PR also updated related document about ``scheduler.max_tis_per_query`` to help users understand how to set this configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

users of docker compose do not realise that docker compose has built-in mechanism for rebuilding the image automatically when needed and do not realise that this does not make their workflows more complex. Apparently just describing how you can use custom images is either scary or not clear enough, as users keep on for dynamic way of adding the packages (which makes no sense if you use what docker-compose provides out-of-the-box) so it is worthwile to specifically mention \"requirements.txt\" and explicitly add all the steps needed to make requirements.txt and custom Docker image part of your regular workflow.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Adding `*_lookup_pattern` parameters to allow the user to specify which connection/variable/config they want to be looked in Secrets Manager and/or Systems manager.\r\n\r\n## Which customers are impacted?\r\n- Only customers who use AWS Secret Manager or AWS Systems Manager as secret backend specified through the config `[secret]`\r\n- Among AWS secrets backend customers, only the customers who choose to define the lookup-pattern  will see different behavior which will be based on their definition. There will be no change in the default behavior\r\n\r\n## Why this change is needed?\r\nSome customers want to fallback quickly on the Airflow metastore or env variables instead of looking up first in the secret backend. One example is a user having one connection defined in AWS Secret Manager or AWS Systems Manager and the rest in Airflow metastore. The user does not want to make a request for each connection to the secret backend but only for the specific one.\r\n\r\nRelated: #19251\r\n\r\n@Taragolis you might be interested to look into this

#15994 #23090\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses a few items related to inclusive language use and the CI check:\r\n\r\n- There are several occurrences of \"dummy\" throughout documentation; however the current CI check for preventing non-inclusive language doesn't inspect `docs/` files. Ideally, the docs also include inclusive language.\r\n- Even when removing `docs/` from the exclusion list, non-inclusive language was still escaping pygrep. Upon inspection, the `(?x)` inline modifier was missing from the regex (although intended in #23090). Adding this modifier revealed these \"dummy\" instances and others related non-inclusive occurrences which were previously uncaught. \r\n- The exclusion list seemed too broad in places. There are still instances in which directories are excluded as a whole, but the list now is more tailored to non-inclusive occurrences that are beyond the purview of Airflow, history, dev/test files, etc.","created_at":"2023-02-15T04:59:50Z","updated_at":"2023-03-23T17:36:09Z","closed_at":"2023-02-22T14:45:03Z","merged_at":"2023-02-22T14:45:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"dba390e32330675e1b94442c8001ea980754c189","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

PR builds on the recently-merged [Breeze StatsD Integration](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/29449) PR.  \r\n\r\n[#29449 ](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/29449) established a Docker Compose file which launched everything needed to emit metrics over StatsD and view them in Grafana.  This PR lays the groundwork for the same process but uses OpenTelemetry instead of StatsD.  It will be a required test environment for upcoming work on [AIP-49 OpenTelemetry Support for Apache Airflow](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-49+OpenTelemetry+Support+for+Apache+Airflow).\r\n\r\nI included a disclaimer in the documentation page that the underlying work to make this useful is pending.\r\n\r\nThe first commit [b84e96c](https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/b84e96ce628e9e4a4457f5d58e95142c3101ca52) makes some adjustments to the previous StatsD PR in order to make them more reusable.  Second commit [8092112](https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/809211299c500fb2c8c1eeaee649e9cdf25cbdbc) implements the new work.\r\n\r\ncc @o-nikolas @vincbeck @syedahsn

Yeah it is still an option with emulation AMD64, but personally I do not think it is make sense to add support for something which almost EOL.\r\n- I have a DAG with start date in 1900, due to the fact we use TIMESTAMP for MySQL as result there is no possible to run DAG with start date lower than 1970-01-01. It is probably something new for me, rather than actual problem.\r\n\r\nSome additionals:\r\n- Potentially I could miss some part which also need to be changed.\r\n- This PR create \"chicken or egg\"

we should just chop this view in favor of grid view logging which is the future. But this fixes rendering issues raised here https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/29447#issuecomment-1424981137.\r\n\r\nWhat we do, is in log tailing context (which apparently isn't used in grid, and that's why I did not see this in developing trigger logging) we don't add the messages to the log content.  So, whenever log_pos is in metadata we don't add messages.  It means the messages could be a bit stale but that seems ok.  Refreshing the page could fix that.  Longer term, we could update the API so that log content is just content and the messages are themselves returned in the metadata dict.  That's probably the \"right\" solution ultimately.  But can be saved for another day.  Also resolve the \"cannot load lazy instance\" issue when invoking the reader logic from this different context.\r\n\r\nVideo:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15932138/218339055-418c3fc0-ba1f-4d90-aad6-8f1af55ecd65.mov\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-12T21:45:35Z","updated_at":"2023-03-23T17:26:11Z","closed_at":"2023-02-17T07:00:57Z","merged_at":"2023-02-17T07:00:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"7cf5cea76e3ff8b790d7185632b6dd7b0196f0e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver

change #29184 added cleanup of MyPy cache when `breeze stop` was called, but this is a bit too agressive. It will remove the cache always when breeze stop is run and it will prolong (on MacOS by 10s of seconds) the MyPy static checks when it happens.\r\n\r\nSince cleaning the cache is only really needed when MyPy cache gets broken (for example when we upgrade MyPy), cleaning it explicitly when you encounter such problem is a better idea.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n\r\n* adds flag to breeze stop to clean the mypy cache (disabled by default)\r\n* adds documentation about that feature in STATIC_CHECKS\r\n* adds hint displayed to the user when mypy check fails\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

of the deprecated warning messages we \"know\" and deliberately ignore as \"known\" in provider import verification, had variable parts that kept on changing when new version of dependencies (for exmaple snowflake library) has been released. The known warning already supports substring match for a while, this PR just turns the known warnings with variable parts into substrings.\r\n\r\nShortening the messages and turning them into one-liners makes it also cleaner to read and understand how many warnings we ignore, as well as allows to remove some duplication.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR will solve the issue registered by @RishuGuru in #28121.\r\nIt also takes into account the request from @potiuk in #28123 to add/fix the unit tests.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the SFTP Sensor was not finding the files when the `file_pattern` argument was used.\r\nThis was due to an incorrect assumption that  the SFTP Hook function `get_file_by_pattern` would return the full path, where actually it only returns the file name (corrected in e08a702b508e01c8437e4a45eaa726bb39e4f47f).\r\n\r\nThe unit test that was checking that also made this assumption (corrected in 018f316f96ed5f6361eea59987996454ced73bc7).\r\n\r\nAlso the unit test `test_file_with_pattern_parameter_call` seemed to become redundant, and I removed it (full explanation in faa5a73d5b353a3c2c83a90b5040966158b97979).\r\n\r\ncloses:

#29432\r\nrelated: #25588\r\n\r\nBy default, to render nested fields, we need to provide a nested argument `template_fields` contains the list of nested fields names to render. In some of the operator (ex `KubernetesPodOperator`) we override the method `_render_nested_template_fields` to define how we want to render the nested fields.\r\n\r\nThis works fine with the normal operator because they extend the `BaseOperator`, and since they are not sub classes of `MappedOperator`, when it calls this method we call directly `Templater._render_nested_template_fields` instead of calling the method we overrode.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, I replaced `self._do_render_template_fields` by `unmapped_task._do_render_template_fields` where `unmapped_task` is an instance of the

`breeze start-airflow --integration statsd` will launch Breeze along with docker containers for statsd, Prometheus, and Grafana.  This allows us to test [Airflow's statsd metrics](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/administration-and-deployment/logging-monitoring/metrics.html) emitting.  \r\n\r\nThe general workflow here is that Breeze/Airflow will push metrics to statsd.  Prometheus pulls from stats, and Grafana pulls from Prometheus.  I found a lovely diagram and a pretty good explanation [here](https://github.com/sarahmk125/airflow-docker-metrics) which I used as the basis for this change.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1920178/217928399-407bf212-dded-4ea7-94fc-bcb516c4426c.png) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Includes config files which are mounted into the Prometheus and Grafana containers in order to configure the ports and connections between the services/containers, and populates a default dashboard in Grafana.\r\n- Updates the CLI help menus \r\n- Grafana and Prometheus config files do not match our chosen JSON schema, so they are added as exemptions in the json linter\r\n\r\n\r\nI've left a few notes and questions in the

[ECS.Client.run_task](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/ecs.html#ECS.Client.run_task) ability to setup startedBy and filter it later.\r\n\r\n`startedBy` limited by 36 characters an it is not possible to use string representation of `dag_id` + `task_id` + `run_id` + `map_id`, instead of this generate UUID based on this value which can be used as unique (per TI) value.\r\n\r\nUnfortunetly right now `EcsRunTaskOperator` set `startedBy` by owner of task, so it become mutuality exclusive:\r\n1.

we deactivate stale DAGs, we add a buffer to the last parsed time of a DAG when comparing it to the last parsed time of its DAG file to account for DAG files that take a long time to process. \r\n```python\r\n\r\n        for dag in dags_parsed:\r\n            # The largest valid difference between a DagFileStat's last_finished_time and a DAG's\r\n            # last_parsed_time is _processor_timeout. Longer than that indicates that the DAG is\r\n            # no longer present in the file.\r\n            if (\r\n                dag.fileloc in last_parsed\r\n                and (dag.last_parsed_time + processor_timeout) < last_parsed[dag.fileloc]\r\n            ):\r\n                cls.logger().info(\"DAG %s is missing and will be deactivated.\", dag.dag_id)\r\n                to_deactivate.add(dag.dag_id)\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe upper bound on this delay is indeed the processor timeout, but practically speaking, this is unnecessary when we configure a long timeout. This can result in a large delay in stale DAG deactivation. I think this buffer should be configurable.\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
