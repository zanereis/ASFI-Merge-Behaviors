What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt seems the proximate cause of the test failures is that `cast(str as decimal)` in derby will raise an exception instead of returning NULL. This is a problem since Hive sometimes inserts `__HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__` entries into the partition table as documented here: https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/MetaStoreDirectSql.java#L1034\r\n\r\nBasically, when these special default partitions are present, partition pruning pushdown using the SQL-direct mode will fail due this cast exception. As commented on in `MetaStoreDirectSql.java` above, this is normally fine since Hive falls back to JDO pruning, however when the pruning predicate contains an unsupported operator such as `>`, that will fail as well.\r\n\r\nThe only remaining question is why this behavior is nondeterministic. We know that when the test flakes, retries do not help, therefore the cause must be environmental. The current best hypothesis is that some config is different between different jenkins runs, which is why this PR prints out the Spark SQL and Hive confs for the test. The hope is that by comparing the config state for failure vs success we can isolate the root cause of the flakiness.\r\n\r\n**Update:** we could not isolate the issue. It does not seem to be due to configuration differences. As such, I'm going to enable the non-flaky parts of the test since we are fairly confident these issues only occur with Derby (which is not used in production).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRuntimeReplaceable is used to create aliases for expressions, but the way it deals with type coercion is pretty weird (each expression is responsible for how to handle type coercion, which does not obey the normal implicit type cast rules).\r\n\r\nThis patch simplifies its handling by allowing the analyzer to traverse into the actual expression of a RuntimeReplaceable.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n- Correctness should be guaranteed by existing unit tests already\r\n- Removed SQLCompatibilityFunctionSuite and moved it sql-compatibility-functions.sql\r\n- Added a new test case in sql-compatibility-functions.sql for verifying explain behavior.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-02T00:35:54Z","updated_at":"2016-11-02T22:55:16Z","closed_at":"2016-11-02T22:55:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f28dec19fb6f98585cb5bbc3f4b134d6d6fad65c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15723/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15723/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15723/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/01cfa0073fc72f232c7ba27c2e6a5c4454bf9403","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-18214","ref":"SPARK-18214","sha":"01cfa0073fc72f232c7ba27c2e6a5c4454bf9403","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBytesToBytesMap currently does not release the in-memory storage (the longArray variable) after it spills to disk. This is typically not a problem during aggregation because the longArray should be much smaller than the pages, and because we grow the longArray at a conservative rate.\r\n\r\nHowever this can lead to an OOM when an already running task is allocated more than its fair share, this can happen because of a scheduling delay. In this case the longArray can grow beyond the fair share of memory for the task. This becomes problematic when the task spills and the long array is not freed, that causes subsequent memory allocation requests to be denied by the memory manager resulting in an OOM.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issuing by freeing the longArray when the BytesToBytesMap spills.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests and tested on realworld workloads.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-01T22:57:31Z","updated_at":"2016-12-07T12:43:09Z","closed_at":"2016-12-07T12:35:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7b4d38f1db1ec5bf9ef404049f06cf19c8ad3446","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15722/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15722/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15722/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e7ec5bf4fa647c6cdd92fa3adb44cc06ea46de75","head":{"label":"jiexiong:jie_oom_fix","ref":"jie_oom_fix","sha":"e7ec5bf4fa647c6cdd92fa3adb44cc06ea46de75","user":{"login":"jiexiong","id":6044805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNDQ4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6044805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiexiong","html_url":"https://github.com/jiexiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiexiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiexiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiexiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiexiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiexiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiexiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiexiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiexiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiexiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":72564082,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MjU2NDA4Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiexiong/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiexiong","id":6044805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNDQ4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6044805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiexiong","html_url":"https://github.com/jiexiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiexiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiexiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiexiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiexiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiexiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiexiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiexiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiexiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiexiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiexiong/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMore and more ML algos are accepting sample weights, and they have been tested rather heterogeneously and with code duplication. This patch adds extensible helper methods to `MLTestingUtils` that can be reused by various algorithms accepting sample weights. Up to now, there seems to be a few tests that have been implemented commonly:\r\n\r\n* Check that oversampling is the same as giving the instances sample weights proportional to the number of samples\r\n* Check that outliers with tiny sample weights do not affect the algorithm's performance\r\n\r\nThis patch adds an additional test:\r\n\r\n* Check that algorithms are invariant to constant scaling of the sample weights. i.e. uniform sample weights with `w_i = 1.0` is effectively the same as uniform sample weights with `w_i = 10000` or `w_i = 0.0001`\r\n\r\nThe instances of these tests occurred in LinearRegression, NaiveBayes, and LogisticRegression. Those tests have been removed/modified to use the new helper methods. These helper functions will be of use when [SPARK-9478](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-9478) is implemented. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch only involves modifying test suites.\r\n\r\n## Other notes\r\n\r\nBoth IsotonicRegression and GeneralizedLinearRegression also extend `HasWeightCol`. I did not modify these test suites because it will make this patch easier to review, and because they did not duplicate the same tests as the three suites that were modified. If we want to change them later, we can create a JIRA for it now, but it's open for debate.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-01T20:55:49Z","updated_at":"2016-12-28T15:34:28Z","closed_at":"2016-12-28T15:03:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b7ea2766246bc01e99e5f446f4b712430d719d9c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15721/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15721/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15721/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f2dbdd9a67cb262d9bf339b7724041471e5332ca","head":{"label":"sethah:SPARK-17772","ref":"SPARK-17772","sha":"f2dbdd9a67cb262d9bf339b7724041471e5332ca","user":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38016887,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODAxNjg4Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sethah/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sethah/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSimplify struct creation, especially the aspect of `CleanupAliases` which missed some aliases when handling trees created by `CreateStruct`.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes:\r\n\r\n1. A failing test (create struct with nested aliases, some of the aliases survive `CleanupAliases`).\r\n2. A fix that transforms `CreateStruct` into a `CreateNamedStruct` constructor, effectively eliminating `CreateStruct` from all expression trees.\r\n3. A `NamePlaceHolder` used by `CreateStruct` when column names cannot be extracted from unresolved `NamedExpression`.\r\n4. A new Analyzer rule that resolves `NamePlaceHolder` into a string literal once the `NamedExpression` is resolved.\r\n5. `CleanupAliases` code was simplified as it no longer has to deal with `CreateStruct`'s top level columns.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nRunning all tests-suits in package org.apache.spark.sql, especially including the analysis suite, making sure added test initially fails, after applying suggested fix rerun the entire analysis package successfully.\r\n\r\nModified few tests that expected `CreateStruct` which is now transformed into `CreateNamedStruct`.","created_at":"2016-11-01T16:47:44Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T11:17:31Z","closed_at":"2016-11-02T10:14:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4a9c25a63c17c28a5bcfbd86a901dcebba574dc0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15718/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15718/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15718/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c0263d7cc136d7c00455fb74748755ffc5eda8ce","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-16839-2","ref":"SPARK-16839-2","sha":"c0263d7cc136d7c00455fb74748755ffc5eda8ce","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRight now, once a user set the comment of a column with create table command, he/she cannot update the comment. It will be useful to provide a public interface (e.g. SQL) to do that.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the following SQL statement:\r\n```\r\nALTER TABLE table [PARTITION partition_spec]\r\nCHANGE [COLUMN] column_old_name column_new_name column_dataType\r\n[COMMENT column_comment]\r\n[FIRST | AFTER column_name];\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor further expansion, we could support alter `name`/`dataType`/`index` of a column too.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd new test cases in `ExternalCatalogSuite` and `SessionCatalogSuite`.\r\nAdd sql file test for `ALTER TABLE CHANGE COLUMN` statement.","created_at":"2016-11-01T16:08:35Z","updated_at":"2018-02-27T11:14:08Z","closed_at":"2016-12-15T18:12:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"42e2e73994af4a156f3013d764641a4840cdb77d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15717/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15717/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15717/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/73c82fc1e2192a7bd91273735c36697d949ae76d","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:change-column","ref":"change-column","sha":"73c82fc1e2192a7bd91273735c36697d949ae76d","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch adds a new commit protocol implementation ManifestFileCommitProtocol that follows the existing streaming flow, and uses it in FileStreamSink to consolidate the write path in structured streaming with the batch mode write path.\r\n\r\nThis deletes a lot of code, and would make it trivial to support other functionalities that are currently available in batch but not in streaming, including all file formats and bucketing.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nShould be covered by existing tests.","created_at":"2016-11-01T05:27:41Z","updated_at":"2016-11-02T01:09:37Z","closed_at":"2016-11-02T01:09:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e53597ba66feb1bca2cb0fd2d7bd1419de3c8a51","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15710/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15710/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15710/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a2ea180b4cab053cdcdf47351a3031bffbd501b7","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-18025","ref":"SPARK-18025","sha":"a2ea180b4cab053cdcdf47351a3031bffbd501b7","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark supports the test on Windows via AppVeyor but not it seems failing to download R 3.3.1 after R 3.3.2 is released. It downloads given R version after checking if that is the latest or not via http://rversions.r-pkg.org/r-release because the URL.\r\n\r\nFor example, the latest one has the URL as below:\r\n\r\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-3.3.1-win.exe\r\n\r\nand the old one has the URL as below.\r\n\r\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/3.3.0/R-3.3.0-win.exe\r\n\r\nThe problem is, it seems (_according to my observation, please check the main page_[1])  the versions of R on Windows are not always synced with the latest versions. It seems R 3.3.2 for Windows does not exist.\r\n\r\nSo, it seems currently we can't download R 3.3.1 from the old repository[2] . So, currently, AppVeyor tries to find R 3.3.1 in the old repository[2] as 3.3.2 is released but it does not exist because it seems R 3.3.2 for Windows is not there and R 3.3.1 is still the latest.\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR proposes to lower the R version into 3.3.0 rather than rely on the latest as  SparkR supports R 3.1+ if I recall correctly.\r\n\r\n[1]https://cran.r-project.org\r\n[2]https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually via AppVeyor CI - https://ci.appveyor.com/project/spark-test/spark/build/43-test\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-01T03:42:36Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:43:57Z","closed_at":"2016-11-01T07:05:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6fa5178b447971b0bc0e31ddb97cf7ac435c094e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15709/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15709/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15709/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/90fe001145da62391c5a2a9efbdebc201e621e95","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-18190","ref":"SPARK-18190","sha":"90fe001145da62391c5a2a9efbdebc201e621e95","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

PARTITION will actually overwrite the entire table instead of just the specified partition.\r\n(2) INSERT|OVERWRITE does not work with partitions that have custom locations.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes both of these issues for Datasource tables managed by Hive. The behavior for legacy tables or when `manageFilesourcePartitions = false` is unchanged.\r\n\r\nThere is one other issue in that INSERT OVERWRITE with dynamic partitions will overwrite the entire table instead of just the updated partitions, but this behavior is pretty complicated to implement for Datasource tables. We should address that in a future release.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhile being evaluated in Spark SQL, Hive UDAFs don't support partial aggregation. This PR migrates `HiveUDAFFunction`s to `TypedImperativeAggregate`, which already provides partial aggregation support for aggregate functions that may use arbitrary Java objects as aggregation states.\r\n\r\nThe following snippet shows the effect of this PR:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.udf.generic.GenericUDAFMax\r\nsql(s\"CREATE FUNCTION hive_max AS '${classOf[GenericUDAFMax].getName}'\")\r\n\r\nspark.range(100).createOrReplaceTempView(\"t\")\r\n\r\n// A query using both Spark SQL native `max` and Hive `max`\r\nsql(s\"SELECT max(id), hive_max(id) FROM t\").explain()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nSortAggregate(key=[], functions=[max(id#1L), default.hive_max(default.hive_max, HiveFunctionWrapper(org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.udf.generic.GenericUDAFMax,org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.udf.generic.GenericUDAFMax@7475f57e), id#1L, false, 0, 0)])\r\n+- Exchange SinglePartition\r\n   +- *Range (0, 100, step=1, splits=Some(1))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nSortAggregate(key=[], functions=[max(id#1L), default.hive_max(default.hive_max, HiveFunctionWrapper(org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.udf.generic.GenericUDAFMax,org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.udf.generic.GenericUDAFMax@5e18a6a7), id#1L, false, 0, 0)])\r\n+- Exchange SinglePartition\r\n   +- SortAggregate(key=[], functions=[partial_max(id#1L), partial_default.hive_max(default.hive_max, HiveFunctionWrapper(org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.udf.generic.GenericUDAFMax,org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.udf.generic.GenericUDAFMax@5e18a6a7), id#1L, false, 0, 0)])\r\n      +- *Range (0, 100, step=1, splits=Some(1))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe tricky part of the PR is mostly about updating and passing around aggregation states of `HiveUDAFFunction`s since the aggregation state of a Hive UDAF may appear in three different forms. Let's take a look at the testing `MockUDAF` added in this PR as an example. This UDAF computes the count of non-null values together with the count of nulls of a given column. Its aggregation state may appear as the following forms at different time:\r\n\r\n1. A `MockUDAFBuffer`, which is a concrete subclass of `GenericUDAFEvaluator.AggregationBuffer`\r\n\r\n   The form used by Hive UDAF API. This form is required by the following scenarios:\r\n\r\n   - Calling `GenericUDAFEvaluator.iterate()` to update an existing aggregation state with new input values.\r\n   - Calling `GenericUDAFEvaluator.terminate()` to get the final aggregated value from an existing aggregation state.\r\n   - Calling `GenericUDAFEvaluator.merge()` to merge other aggregation states into an existing aggregation state.\r\n\r\n     The existing aggregation state to be updated must be in this form.\r\n\r\n   Conversions:\r\n\r\n   - To form 2:\r\n\r\n     `GenericUDAFEvaluator.terminatePartial()`\r\n\r\n   - To form 3:\r\n\r\n     Convert to form 2 first, and then to 3.\r\n\r\n2. An `Object[]` array containing two `java.lang.Long` values.\r\n\r\n   The form used to interact with Hive's `ObjectInspector`s. This form is required by the following scenarios:\r\n\r\n   - Calling `GenericUDAFEvaluator.terminatePartial()` to convert an existing aggregation state in form 1 to form 2.\r\n   - Calling `GenericUDAFEvaluator.merge()` to merge other aggregation states into an existing aggregation state.\r\n\r\n     The input aggregation state must be in this form.\r\n\r\n   Conversions:\r\n\r\n   - To form 1:\r\n\r\n     No direct method.

PR adds a new method `withWatermark` to the `Dataset` API, which can be used specify an _event time watermark_.  An event time watermark allows the streaming engine to reason about the point in time after which we no longer expect to see late data.  This PR also has augmented `StreamExecution` to use this watermark for several purposes:\r\n  - To know when a given time window aggregation is finalized and thus results can be emitted when using output modes that do not allow updates (e.g. `Append` mode).\r\n  - To minimize the amount of state that we need to keep for on-going aggregations, by evicting state for groups that are no longer expected to change.  Although, we do still maintain all state if the query requires (i.e. if the event time is not present in the `groupBy` or when running in `Complete` mode).\r\n\r\nAn example that emits windowed counts of records, waiting up to 5 minutes for late data to arrive.\r\n```scala\r\ndf.withWatermark(\"eventTime\", \"5 minutes\")\r\n  .groupBy(window($\"eventTime\", \"1 minute\") as 'window)\r\n  .count()\r\n  .writeStream\r\n  .format(\"console\")\r\n  .mode(\"append\") // In append mode, we only output finalized aggregations.\r\n  .start()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Calculating the watermark.\r\nThe current event time is computed by looking at the `MAX(eventTime)` seen this epoch across all of the partitions in the query minus some user defined _delayThreshold_.  An additional constraint is that the watermark must increase monotonically.\r\n\r\nNote that since we must coordinate this value across partitions occasionally, the actual watermark used is only guaranteed to be at least `delay` behind the actual event time.  In some cases we may still process records that arrive more than delay late.\r\n\r\nThis mechanism was chosen for the initial implementation over processing time for two reasons:   \r\n  - it is robust to downtime that could affect processing delay\r\n  - it does not require syncing of time or timezones between the producer and the processing engine.\r\n\r\n### Other notable implementation details\r\n - A new trigger metric `eventTimeWatermark` outputs the current value of the watermark.\r\n - We mark the event time column in the `Attribute` metadata using the key `spark.watermarkDelay`.  This allows downstream operations to know which column holds the event time.  Operations like `window` propagate this metadata.\r\n - `explain()` marks the watermark with a suffix of `-T${delayMs}` to ease debugging of how this information is propagated.\r\n - Currently, we don't filter out late records, but instead rely on the state store to avoid emitting records that are both added and filtered in the same epoch.\r\n\r\n### Remaining in this PR\r\n - [ ] The test for recovery is currently failing as we don't record the watermark used in the offset log.  We will need to do so to ensure determinism, but this is deferred until #15626 is merged.\r\n\r\n### Other follow-ups\r\nThere are some natural additional features that we should consider for future work:\r\n - Ability to write records that arrive too late to some external store in case any out-of-band remediation is required.\r\n - `Update` mode so you can get partial results before a group is evicted.\r\n - Other mechanisms for calculating the watermark.  In particular a watermark based on quantiles would be more robust to outliers.","created_at":"2016-10-31T22:22:07Z","updated_at":"2016-11-15T00:48:44Z","closed_at":"2016-11-15T00:48:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cf4ac6275858e260e088c60cfe69c6f92b0f4d7a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15702/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15702/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15702/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/87d8618234a86d666a711a97080e2b014214b84a","head":{"label":"marmbrus:watermarks","ref":"watermarks","sha":"87d8618234a86d666a711a97080e2b014214b84a","user":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17230869,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMDg2OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"marmbrus/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nEnabled SparkR with Mesos client mode and cluster mode. Just a few changes were required to get this working on Mesos: (1) removed the SparkR on Mesos error checks and (2) do not require \"--class\" to be specified for R apps. The logic to check spark.mesos.executor.home was already in there.\r\n\r\n@sun-rui \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. SparkSubmitSuite\r\n2. On local mesos cluster (on laptop): ran SparkR shell, spark-submit client mode, and spark-submit cluster mode, with the \"examples/src/main/R/dataframe.R\" example application.\r\n3. On multi-node mesos cluster: ran SparkR shell, spark-submit client mode, and spark-submit cluster mode, with the \"examples/src/main/R/dataframe.R\" example application. I tested with the following --conf values set: spark.mesos.executor.docker.image and spark.mesos.executor.home\r\n\r\nThis contribution is my original work and I license the work to the project under the project's open source license.\r\n","created_at":"2016-10-31T21:08:54Z","updated_at":"2017-07-10T22:07:26Z","closed_at":"2016-11-05T17:47:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d561aa09c45fb8cae250a03a0071ff649415b72c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15700/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15700/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15700/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/11b65685bdbaf23f109895041cc48bc3d351680a","head":{"label":"d2iq-archive:susan-r-branch","ref":"susan-r-branch","sha":"11b65685bdbaf23f109895041cc48bc3d351680a","user":{"login":"d2iq-archive","id":184508684,"node_id":"O_kgDOCv9hDA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184508684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive","html_url":"https://github.com/d2iq-archive","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34087729,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA4NzcyOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"d2iq-archive/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"d2iq-archive","id":184508684,"node_id":"O_kgDOCv9hDA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184508684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive","html_url":"https://github.com/d2iq-archive","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/d2iq-archive/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch introduces an internal commit protocol API that is used by the batch data source to do write commits. It currently has only one implementation that uses Hadoop MapReduce's OutputCommitter API. In the future, this commit API can be used to unify streaming and batch commits.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nShould be covered by existing write

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs reported in the jira, sometimes the generated java code in codegen will cause compilation error.\r\n\r\nCode snippet to test it:\r\n\r\n    case class Route(src: String, dest: String, cost: Int)\r\n    case class GroupedRoutes(src: String, dest: String, routes: Seq[Route])\r\n\r\n    val ds = sc.parallelize(Array(\r\n      Route(\"a\", \"b\", 1),\r\n      Route(\"a\", \"b\", 2),\r\n      Route(\"a\", \"c\", 2),\r\n      Route(\"a\", \"d\", 10),\r\n      Route(\"b\", \"a\", 1),\r\n      Route(\"b\", \"a\", 5),\r\n      Route(\"b\",

GroupedRoutes) =>\r\n        GroupedRoutes(g1.src, g1.dest, g1.routes ++ g2.routes)\r\n      }.map(_._2)\r\n\r\nThe problem here is, in `ReferenceToExpressions` we evaluate the children vars to local variables. Then the result expression is evaluated to use those children variables. In the above case, the result expression code is too long and will be split by `CodegenContext.splitExpression`. So those local variables cannot be accessed and cause compilation error.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSo far, we have limited test case coverage about implicit type casting. We need to draw a matrix to find all the possible casting pairs.\r\n- Reorged the existing test cases\r\n- Added all the possible type casting pairs\r\n- Drawed a matrix to show the implicit type casting. The table is very wide. Maybe hard to review. Thus, you also can access the same table via the link to [a google

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFor the expressions that extend `String2StringExpression` (including, `lower`, `upper`, `ltrim`, `rtrim`, `trim` and `reverse`), `Analyzer` should not implicitly cast the arguments to string. Instead, if users input the some data types instead of string, we should issue an exception for this misuse.\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a test case in the `StringFunctionsSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-10-30T19:17:57Z","updated_at":"2016-10-31T06:41:14Z","closed_at":"2016-10-31T01:35:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0241ec75e2a95fb243517204b00217c6b4d798d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15690/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15690/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15690/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a2c6d4e06a11350a9ab8493fc1cd5ef5750c3c77","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:string2string","ref":"string2string","sha":"a2c6d4e06a11350a9ab8493fc1cd5ef5750c3c77","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn [SPARK-4563](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-4563) we added the support for the driver to advertise a different hostname/ip (`spark.driver.host` to the executors other than the hostname/ip the driver actually binds to (`spark.driver.bindAddress`). But in the mesos webui's frameworks page, it still shows the driver's binds hostname/ip (though the web ui link is correct). We should fix it to make them consistent. \n\nBefore:\n\n![mesos-spark](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/717363/19835148/4dffc6d4-9eb8-11e6-8999-f80f10e4c3f7.png)\n\nAfter:\n\n![mesos-spark2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/717363/19835149/54596ae4-9eb8-11e6-896c-230426acd1a1.png)\n\nThis PR doesn't affect the behavior on the spark side, only makes the display on the mesos master side more consistent.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual test. \n- Build the package and build a docker image (spark:2.1-test)\n\n``` sh\n./dev/make-distribution.sh -Phadoop-2.6 -Phive -Phive-thriftserver -Pyarn -Pmesos\n```\n-  Then run the spark driver inside a docker container.\n\n``` sh\ndocker run --rm -it \\\n  --name=spark \\\n  -p 30000-30010:30000-30010 \\\n  -e LIBPROCESS_ADVERTISE_IP=172.17.42.1 \\\n  -e LIBPROCESS_PORT=30000 \\\n  -e MESOS_NATIVE_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib/libmesos-1.0.0.so \\\n  -e MESOS_NATIVE_JAVA_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib/libmesos-1.0.0.so \\\n  -e SPARK_HOME=/opt/dist \\\n  spark:2.1-test\n```\n- Inside the container, launch the spark driver, making use of the advertised address:\n\n``` sh\n/opt/dist/bin/spark-shell \\\n  --master mesos://zk://172.17.42.1:2181/mesos \\\n  --conf spark.driver.host=172.17.42.1 \\\n  --conf spark.driver.bindAddress=172.17.0.1 \\\n  --conf spark.driver.port=30001 \\\n  --conf spark.driver.blockManager.port=30002 \\\n  --conf spark.ui.port=30003 \\\n  --conf spark.mesos.coarse=true \\\n  --conf spark.cores.max=2 \\\n  --conf spark.executor.cores=1 \\\n  --conf spark.executor.memory=1g \\\n  --conf spark.mesos.executor.docker.image=spark:2.1-test\n```\n- Run several spark jobs to ensure everything is running fine.\n\n``` scala\nval rdd =

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe current implementation of Poisson GLM seems to allow only positive values. This is incorrect since the support of Poisson includes the origin. The bug is easily fixed by changing the test of the Poisson variable from  'require(y **>** 0.0' to  'require(y **>=** 0.0'. \n\n@mengxr  @srowen

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nApache Spark 2.x shows an **AnalysisException** warning message when dropping a **view** on a dropped table. This does not happen on dropping **temporary views**. Also, Spark 1.6.x does not show warnings. We had better suppress this to be more consistent in Spark 2.x and with Spark 1.6.x.\n\n``` scala\nscala> sql(\"create table t(a int)\")\n\nscala> sql(\"create view v as select * from t\")\n\nscala> sql(\"create temporary view tv as select * from t\")\n\nscala> sql(\"drop table t\")\n\nscala> sql(\"drop view tv\")\n\nscala> sql(\"drop view v\")\n16/10/29 15:50:03 WARN DropTableCommand: org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Table or view not found: `default`.`t`; line 1 pos 91;\n'SubqueryAlias v, `default`.`v`\n+- 'Project ['gen_attr_0 AS a#19]\n   +- 'SubqueryAlias t\n      +- 'Project ['gen_attr_0]\n         +- 'SubqueryAlias gen_subquery_0\n            +- 'Project ['a AS gen_attr_0#18]\n               +- 'UnresolvedRelation `default`.`t`\n\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Table or view not found: `default`.`t`; line 1 pos 91;\n'SubqueryAlias v, `default`.`v`\n+- 'Project ['gen_attr_0 AS a#19]\n   +- 'SubqueryAlias t\n      +- 'Project ['gen_attr_0]\n         +- 'SubqueryAlias gen_subquery_0\n            +- 'Project ['a AS gen_attr_0#18]\n               +- 'UnresolvedRelation `default`.`t`\n...\nres5: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\n```\n\nNote that this is different case of dropping non-exist views. For those cases, Spark raises **NoSuchTableException**.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual because this is a suppression of warning message.\n","created_at":"2016-10-29T23:14:48Z","updated_at":"2019-01-07T07:03:05Z","closed_at":"2016-11-22T23:33:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3be22b2ab5f5cc8a45f6c9d05b186d37b2a8050e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15682/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15682/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15682/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fef9981ac140112c05f40c093b2174d1584caaf9","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-18169","ref":"SPARK-18169","sha":"fef9981ac140112c05f40c093b2174d1584caaf9","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"6021c95a3aa3858b0499782b23b08ef92c73245d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\norg.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.SQLQuerySuite is flaking when hive partition pruning is enabled.\nBased on the stack traces, it seems to be an old issue where Hive fails to cast a numeric partition column (\"Invalid character string format for type DECIMAL\"). There are two possibilities here: either we are somehow corrupting the partition table to have non-decimal values in that column, or there is a transient issue with Derby.\n\nThis PR logs the result of the retry when this exception is encountered, so we can confirm what is going on.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nn/a\n\ncc @yhuai

to Jira issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17992)\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe recently added table partition pruning for partitioned Hive tables converted to using `TableFileCatalog`. When the Hive configuration option `hive.metastore.try.direct.sql` is set to `false`, Hive will throw an exception for unsupported filter expressions. For example, attempting to filter on an integer partition column will throw a `org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.api.MetaException`.\n\nI discovered this behavior because VideoAmp uses the CDH version of Hive with a Postgresql metastore DB. In this configuration, CDH sets `hive.metastore.try.direct.sql` to `false` by default, and queries that filter on a non-string partition column will fail.\n\nRather than throw an exception in query planning, this patch catches this exception, logs a warning and returns all table partitions instead. Clients of this method are already expected to handle the possibility that the filters will not be honored.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nA unit test was added.\n","created_at":"2016-10-28T17:49:47Z","updated_at":"2018-09-27T23:34:55Z","closed_at":"2016-11-02T05:22:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b507a31770746c34e22fe6642b80205cd0b41b90","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15673/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15673/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15673/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8d468ac7097de56989deee124ce65a6583f8eaa8","head":{"label":"VideoAmp:spark-17992-catch_hive_partition_filter_exception","ref":"spark-17992-catch_hive_partition_filter_exception","sha":"8d468ac7097de56989deee124ce65a6583f8eaa8","user":{"login":"VideoAmp","id":7621972,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjE5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7621972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp","html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49447912,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTQ0NzkxMg==","name":"spark-public","full_name":"VideoAmp/spark-public","private":false,"owner":{"login":"VideoAmp","id":7621972,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjE5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7621972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp","html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp/spark-public","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAs reported on the jira, insert overwrite statement runs much slower in Spark, compared with hive-client.\n\nIt seems there is a patch [HIVE-11940](https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/ba21806b77287e237e1aa68fa169d2a81e07346d) which largely improves insert overwrite performance on Hive. HIVE-11940 is patched after Hive 2.0.0.\n\nBecause Spark SQL uses older Hive library, we can not benefit from such improvement.\n\nThe reporter verified that there is also a big performance gap between Hive 1.2.1 (520.037 secs) and Hive 2.0.1 (35.975 secs) on insert overwrite execution.\n\nInstead of upgrading to Hive 2.0 in Spark SQL, which might not be a trivial task, this patch provides an approach to delete the partition before asking Hive to load data files into the partition.\n\nNote: The case reported on the jira is insert overwrite to partition. Since `Hive.loadTable` also uses the function to replace files, insert overwrite to table should has the same issue. We can take the same approach to delete the table first. I will upgrade this to include this.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins tests.\n\nThere are existing tests using insert overwrite statement. Those tests should be passed. I added a new test to specially test insert overwrite into partition.\n\nFor performance issue, as I don't have Hive 2.0 environment, this needs the reporter to verify it.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nApache Spark supports the following cases **by quoting RDD column names** while saving through JDBC.\n- Allow reserved keyword as a column name, e.g., 'order'.\n- Allow mixed-case colume names like the following, e.g., `[a: int, A: int]`.\n  \n  ``` scala\n  scala> val df = sql(\"select 1 a, 1 A\")\n  df: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [a: int, A: int]\n  ...\n  scala> df.write.mode(\"overwrite\").format(\"jdbc\").options(option).save()\n  scala> df.write.mode(\"append\").format(\"jdbc\").options(option).save()\n  ```\n\nThis PR aims to use **database column names** instead of RDD column ones in order to support the following additionally.\nNote that this case succeeds with `MySQL`, but fails on `Postgres`/`Oracle` before.\n\n``` scala\nval df1 = sql(\"select 1 a\")\nval df2 = sql(\"select 1 A\")\n...\ndf1.write.mode(\"overwrite\").format(\"jdbc\").options(option).save()\ndf2.write.mode(\"append\").format(\"jdbc\").options(option).save()\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPass the Jenkins test with a new testcase.\n","created_at":"2016-10-27T22:20:19Z","updated_at":"2019-01-07T07:03:21Z","closed_at":"2016-12-30T18:29:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b989197437c6d9b9d43c9c7154b54514f01a45b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15664/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15664/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15664/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/54adaf58da17fff33bb5492bfc498eb8937c4cdf","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-18123","ref":"SPARK-18123","sha":"54adaf58da17fff33bb5492bfc498eb8937c4cdf","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"63036aee2271cdbb7032b51b2ac67edbcb82389e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

jsons.\n","created_at":"2016-10-27T19:49:46Z","updated_at":"2016-11-17T22:31:32Z","closed_at":"2016-10-31T07:13:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"170ef56e87a65bdeb41ea0724dfcecc71ae35a5b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15663/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15663/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15663/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d30a3a5591a485c2a7b6e12c2b006f79ab955db9","head":{"label":"zsxwing:fix-event-log","ref":"fix-event-log","sha":"d30a3a5591a485c2a7b6e12c2b006f79ab955db9","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"ccb11543048dccd4cc590a8db1df1d9d5847d112","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to provide a pip installable PySpark package. This does a bunch of work to copy the jars over and package them with the Python code (to prevent challenges from trying to use different versions of the Python code with different versions of the JAR). It does not currently publish to PyPI but that is the natural follow up (SPARK-18129).\r\n\r\nDone:\r\n- pip installable on conda [manual tested]\r\n- setup.py installed on a non-pip managed system (RHEL) with YARN [manual tested]\r\n- Automated testing of this (virtualenv)\r\n- packaging and signing with release-build*\r\n\r\nPossible follow up work:\r\n- release-build update to publish to PyPI (SPARK-18128)\r\n- figure out who owns the pyspark package name on prod PyPI (is it someone with in the project or should we ask PyPI or should we choose a different name to publish with like ApachePySpark?)\r\n- Windows support and or testing ( SPARK-18136 )\r\n- investigate details of wheel caching and see if we can avoid cleaning the wheel cache during our test\r\n- consider how we want to number our dev/snapshot versions\r\n\r\nExplicitly out of scope:\r\n- Using pip installed PySpark to start a standalone cluster\r\n- Using pip installed PySpark for non-Python Spark programs\r\n\r\n*I've done some work to test release-build locally but as a non-committer I've just done local testing.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAutomated testing with virtualenv, manual testing with conda, a system wide install, and YARN integration.\r\n\r\nrelease-build changes tested locally as a non-committer (no testing of upload artifacts to Apache staging websites)\r\n","created_at":"2016-10-27T08:43:01Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T04:11:00Z","closed_at":"2016-11-16T22:24:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b1b21233c9b4e0a61e87ddddafc1e12f3000e240","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15659/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15659/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15659/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e1398552469288de3829eb889fec0de2ba568f15","head":{"label":"holdenk:SPARK-1267-pip-install-pyspark","ref":"SPARK-1267-pip-install-pyspark","sha":"e1398552469288de3829eb889fec0de2ba568f15","user":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17235154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNTE1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"holdenk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nbackport of pull request #15556\n\nallow ReplayListenerBus to skip deserialising and replaying certain events using an inexpensive check of the event log entry. Use this to ensure that when event log replay is triggered for building the application list, we get the ReplayListenerBus to skip over all but the few events needed for our immediate purpose. Refer [SPARK-18010] for the motivation behind this change.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested with existing HistoryServer and ReplayListener unit test suites. All tests pass.\n\nPlease review https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SPARK/Contributing+to+Spark before opening a pull request.\n\nAuthor: Vinayak vijoshi5@in.ibm.com\n\nCloses #15556 from

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn `Optimizer`, we will infer additional conditions from `Filter`'s constraints which include `IsNotNull`. Some inferred `IsNotNull`s are useful because they can be short circuit for other predicates which refer the same attributes. But for an `IsNotNull` condition, we also infer other `IsNotNull` from it. Those `IsNotNull`s are redundant. We don't need to include them.\n\nE.g., for a condition like `IsNotNull(a + Rand())`, an additional `IsNotNull(a)` will be added into `Filter`'s condition. So we need to evaluate `IsNotNull(a + Rand()) && IsNotNull(a)`. Actually we don't need `IsNotNull(a)` because it is guaranteed by the original `IsNotNull(a + Rand())`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins tests.\n\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n### Problem\n\nIterative ML code may easily create query plans that grow exponentially. We found that query planning time also increases exponentially even when all the sub-plan trees are cached.\n\nThe following snippet illustrates the problem:\n\n``` scala\n(0 until 6).foldLeft(Seq(1, 2, 3).toDS) { (plan, iteration) =>\n  println(s\"== Iteration $iteration ==\")\n  val time0 = System.currentTimeMillis()\n  val joined = plan.join(plan, \"value\").join(plan, \"value\").join(plan, \"value\").join(plan, \"value\")\n  joined.cache()\n  println(s\"Query planning takes ${System.currentTimeMillis() - time0} ms\")\n  joined.as[Int]\n}\n\n// == Iteration 0 ==\n// Query planning takes 9 ms\n// == Iteration 1 ==\n// Query planning takes 26 ms\n// == Iteration 2 ==\n// Query planning takes 53 ms\n// == Iteration 3 ==\n// Query planning takes 163 ms\n// == Iteration 4 ==\n// Query planning takes 700 ms\n// == Iteration 5 ==\n// Query planning takes 3418 ms\n```\n\nThis is because when building a new Dataset, the new plan is always built upon `QueryExecution.analyzed`, which doesn't leverage existing cached plans.\n\nOn the other hand, usually, doing caching every a few iterations may not be the right direction for this problem since caching is too memory consuming (imaging computing connected components over a graph with 50 billion nodes). What we really need here is to truncate both the query plan (to minimize query planning time) and the lineage of the underlying RDD (to avoid stack overflow).\n### Changes introduced in this PR\n\nThis PR tries to fix this issue by introducing a `checkpoint()` method into `Dataset[T]`, which does exactly the things described above. The following snippet, which is essentially the same as the one above but invokes `checkpoint()` instead of `cache()`, shows the micro benchmark result of this PR:\n\nOne key point is that the checkpointed Dataset should preserve the origianl partitioning and ordering information of the original Dataset, so that we can avoid unnecessary shuffling (similar to reading from a pre-bucketed table). This is done by adding `outputPartitioning` and `outputOrdering` to `LogicalRDD` and `RDDScanExec`.\n### Micro benchmark\n\n``` scala\nspark.sparkContext.setCheckpointDir(\"/tmp/cp\")\n\n(0 until 100).foldLeft(Seq(1, 2, 3).toDS) { (plan, iteration) =>\n  println(s\"== Iteration $iteration ==\")\n  val time0 = System.currentTimeMillis()\n  val cp = plan.checkpoint()\n  cp.count()\n  System.out.println(s\"Checkpointing takes ${System.currentTimeMillis() - time0} ms\")\n\n  val time1 = System.currentTimeMillis()\n  val joined = cp.join(cp, \"value\").join(cp, \"value\").join(cp, \"value\").join(cp, \"value\")\n  val result = joined.as[Int]\n\n  println(s\"Query planning takes ${System.currentTimeMillis() - time1} ms\")\n  result\n}\n\n// == Iteration 0 ==\n// Checkpointing takes 591 ms\n// Query planning takes 13 ms\n// == Iteration 1 ==\n// Checkpointing takes 1605 ms\n// Query planning takes 16 ms\n// == Iteration 2 ==\n// Checkpointing takes 782 ms\n// Query planning takes 8 ms\n// == Iteration 3 ==\n// Checkpointing takes 729 ms\n// Query planning takes 10 ms\n// == Iteration 4 ==\n// Checkpointing takes 734 ms\n// Query planning takes 9 ms\n// == Iteration 5 ==\n// ...\n// == Iteration 50 ==\n// Checkpointing takes 571 ms\n// Query planning takes 7 ms\n// == Iteration 51 ==\n// Checkpointing takes 548 ms\n// Query planning takes 7 ms\n// == Iteration 52 ==\n// Checkpointing takes 596 ms\n// Query planning takes 8 ms\n// == Iteration 53 ==\n// Checkpointing takes 568 ms\n// Query planning takes 7 ms\n// ...\n```\n\nYou may see that although checkpointing is more heavy weight an operation, it always takes roughly the same amount of time to perform both checkpointing and query planning.\n### Open question\n\n@mengxr mentioned that it would be more convenient if we can make `Dataset.checkpoint()` eager, i.e., always performs a `RDD.count()` after calling `RDD.checkpoint()`. Not quite sure whether this is a universal requirement. Maybe we can add a `eager: Boolean` argument for `Dataset.checkpoint()` to support that.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test added in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIssue: \nQuerying on a global temp view throws Table or view not found exception. \n\nFix:\nUpdate the lookupRelation in HiveSessionCatalog to check for global temp views similar to the SessionCatalog.lookupRelation.\n\nBefore fix: \nQuerying on a global temp view ( for. e.g.:  select \\* from global_temp.v1)  throws Table or view not found exception\n\nAfter fix: \nQuery succeeds and returns the right result. \n## How was this patch tested?\n- Two unit tests are added to check for global temp view for the code path when hive support is enabled.\n- Regression unit tests were run successfully.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen inserting into datasource tables with partitions managed by the hive metastore, we need to notify the metastore of newly added partitions. Previously this was implemented via `msck repair table`, but this is more expensive than needed.\n\nThis optimizes the insertion path to add only the updated partitions.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests (I verified manually that tests fail if the repair operation is omitted).\n","created_at":"2016-10-26T01:08:02Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T08:54:15Z","closed_at":"2016-11-01T02:49:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ebd52eef9d6e3152f9108511df254442487afe5b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15633/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15633/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15633/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4d967251ce01794f7cdab9f84b70fa5393d1d1f2","head":{"label":"ericl:spark-18087","ref":"spark-18087","sha":"4d967251ce01794f7cdab9f84b70fa5393d1d1f2","user":{"login":"ericl","id":14922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl","html_url":"https://github.com/ericl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23644625,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzY0NDYyNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"ericl/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ericl","id":14922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl","html_url":"https://github.com/ericl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ericl/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn the LZ4BlockInputStream, there is a mistake that it use the originalLen as compressedLen, in the case that the compressed data is longer than original data, then compressedBuffer could overflow (some InputStream may does not check that), which cause it failed to decompress the buffer.\n\nFile a issue in uptream:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a `compressed` method to ML `Matrix` class, which returns the minimal storage representation of the matrix - either sparse or dense. Because the space occupied by a sparse matrix is dependent upon its layout (i.e. column major or row major), this method must consider both cases. It may also be useful to force the layout to be column or row major beforehand, so an overload is added which takes in a `columnMajor: Boolean` parameter.\r\n\r\nThe compressed implementation relies upon two new abstract methods `toDense(columnMajor: Boolean)` and `toSparse(columnMajor: Boolean)`, similar to the compressed method implemented in the `Vector` class. These methods also allow the layout of the resulting matrix to be specified via the `columnMajor` parameter. More detail on the new methods is given below.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded many new unit tests\r\n## New methods (summary, not exhaustive list)\r\n\r\n**Matrix trait**\r\n- `private[ml] def toDenseMatrix(columnMajor: Boolean): DenseMatrix` (abstract) - converts the matrix (either sparse or dense) to dense format\r\n- `private[ml] def toSparseMatrix(columnMajor: Boolean): SparseMatrix` (abstract) -  converts the matrix (either sparse or dense) to sparse format\r\n- `def toDense: DenseMatrix = toDense(true)`  - converts the matrix (either sparse or dense) to dense format in column major layout\r\n- `def toSparse: SparseMatrix = toSparse(true)` -  converts the matrix (either sparse or dense) to sparse format in column major layout\r\n- `def compressed: Matrix` - finds the minimum space representation of this matrix, considering both column and row major layouts, and converts it\r\n- `def compressed(columnMajor: Boolean): Matrix` - finds the minimum space representation of this matrix considering only column OR row major, and converts it\r\n\r\n**DenseMatrix class**\r\n- `private[ml] def toDenseMatrix(columnMajor: Boolean): DenseMatrix` - converts the dense matrix to a dense matrix, optionally changing the layout (data is NOT duplicated if the layouts are the same)\r\n- `private[ml] def toSparseMatrix(columnMajor: Boolean): SparseMatrix` - converts the dense matrix to sparse matrix, using the specified layout\r\n\r\n**SparseMatrix class**\r\n- `private[ml] def toDenseMatrix(columnMajor: Boolean): DenseMatrix` - converts the sparse matrix to a dense matrix, using the specified layout\r\n- `private[ml] def toSparseMatrix(columnMajors: Boolean): SparseMatrix` - converts the sparse matrix to sparse matrix. If the sparse matrix contains any explicit zeros, they are removed. If the layout requested does not match the current layout, data is copied to a new representation. If the layouts match and no explicit zeros exist, the current matrix is returned.\r\n","created_at":"2016-10-25T20:14:46Z","updated_at":"2017-05-15T22:17:29Z","closed_at":"2017-03-24T20:35:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"90abcecf202c19796b1271b269b27c8395a1826e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15628/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15628/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15628/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/87dfaa06b2861ccc4bd5ca62915dea867985b391","head":{"label":"sethah:matrix_compress","ref":"matrix_compress","sha":"87dfaa06b2861ccc4bd5ca62915dea867985b391","user":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38016887,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODAxNjg4Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sethah/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sethah/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nDuring spark-submit, if yarn dist cache is instructed to add same file under --files and --archives, This code change ensures the spark yarn distributed cache behaviour is retained i.e. to warn and fail if same files is mentioned in both --files and --archives.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually tested: \n1. if same jar is mentioned in --jars and --files it will continue to submit the job. \n- basically functionality [SPARK-14423] #12203 is unchanged \n  1. if same file is mentioned in --files and --archives it will
