Description\r\nHey 👋 , I'm member of the Developer Outreach team at DeepSource and ran DeepSource analysis on my fork of the repo. It found some interesting [code quality improvements](https://deepsource.io/gh/ankitdobhal/airflow/issues) to consider.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a few of the issues detected for you to assess if it is right for you.\r\nHappy to provide the tweaks separately otherwise :)\r\n\r\n## Important changes\r\n\r\n- Remove duplicate elements during set declaration\r\n- Remove redundant 'None' default\r\n- Remove reimported module\r\n- Use shallow copy of dictionary for iteration \r\n- Added .deepsource.toml file for continuous analysis on bug risks/performance/code-quality issues on new changes.","created_at":"2021-03-21T08:59:59Z","updated_at":"2021-03-23T10:09:44Z","closed_at":"2021-03-23T10:09:42Z","merged_at":"2021-03-23T10:09:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"b780c2b675e67db7392ff3888d7c93d8fde98d83","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1672279581,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjcyMjc5NTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:CLI","name":"area:CLI","color":"e99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/14920/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/14920/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/14920/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/3f67170fa61ae4e9d3d7c271401b5e72b7f5bcdd","head":{"label":"powerexploit:fix-bug","ref":"fix-bug","sha":"3f67170fa61ae4e9d3d7c271401b5e72b7f5bcdd","user":{"login":"powerexploit","id":38306679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MzA2Njc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38306679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/powerexploit","html_url":"https://github.com/powerexploit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powerexploit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powerexploit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powerexploit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powerexploit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powerexploit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powerexploit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powerexploit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powerexploit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powerexploit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349302343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDkzMDIzNDM=","name":"airflow","full_name":"powerexploit/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"powerexploit","id":38306679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MzA2Njc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38306679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/powerexploit","html_url":"https://github.com/powerexploit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powerexploit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powerexploit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powerexploit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powerexploit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powerexploit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powerexploit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powerexploit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powerexploit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/powerexploit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_

is by far the biggest improvements of the test execution time\r\nwe can get now when we are using self-hosted runners.\r\n\r\nThis change drives down the time of executing all tests on\r\nself-hosted runners from ~ 50 minutes to ~ 13 minutes due to heavy\r\nparallelisation we can implement for different test types and the\r\nfact that our machines for self-hosted runners are far more\r\ncapable - they have more CPU, more memory and the fact that\r\nwe are using tmpfs for everything.\r\n\r\nThis change will also drive the cost of our self-hosted runners\r\ndown. Since we have auto-scaling infrastructure we will simply need\r\nthe machines to run tests for far shorter time. Since the number\r\nof test jobs we run on those self hosted runners is substantial\r\n(10 jobs), we are going to save ~ 6 build hours per one PR/merged\r\ncommit!\r\n\r\nThis also allows the developers to use the power of their\r\ndevelopment machines - when you use\r\n`./scripts/ci/testing/ci_run_airflow_testing.sh` the script\r\ndetects how many CPU cores are available and it will run as\r\nmany parallel test types as many cores you have.\r\n\r\nAlso in case of Integration tests - they require more memory to run\r\nall the integrations, so in case there is less than ~ 32 GB of RAM\r\navailable to Docker, the integration tests are run sequentially\r\nat the end. This drives stability up for machines with lower memory.\r\n\r\nOn one personal PC (64GB RAM, 8 CPUS/16 cores, fast SSD) the full\r\ntest suite execution went down from 30 minutes to 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nThere is a continuous progress information printed every 10 seconds when\r\neither parallel or sequential tests are run, and the full output is\r\nshown at the end - failed tests are marked in red groups, and succesful are\r\nmarked in green groups. This makes it easier to see and analyse errors.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

adds an upgrade rule as described in #12672 to rename the max_threads configuration to parsing_processes.\r\n\r\nI created this rule on the example of the `LoggingConfigurationRule`, which doesn't suggest any changes if the old configuration exists but has the default value. I assume, that the idea behind this is, that if the configuration is not set by the user, a default configuration is taken. However, if a user explicitly copied the default configuration in his or her own configuration, in my opinion, a change should be suggested but isn't. But maybe I misunderstood something.","created_at":"2021-03-20T12:22:14Z","updated_at":"2021-03-23T12:29:29Z","closed_at":"2021-03-23T12:29:28Z","merged_at":"2021-03-23T12:29:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"42dafd2b018713abdb7af5f288ff6cc11bc06d8d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/milestones/30","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/milestone/30","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/milestones/30/labels","id":6499941,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNjQ5OTk0MQ==","number":30,"title":"Airflow

you had to specify AIRFLOW_VERSION_REFERENCE and\r\nAIRFLOW_CONSTRAINTS_REFERENCE to point to the right version\r\nof Airflow. Now those values are auto-detected if not specified\r\n(but you can still override them)\r\n\r\nThis change allowed to simplify and restructure the Dockerfile\r\ndocumentation - following the recent change in separating out\r\nthe docker-stack, production image building documentation has\r\nbeen improved to reflect those simplifications. It should be\r\nmuch easier to grasp by the novice users now - very clear\r\ndistinction and separation is made between the two types of\r\nbuilding your own images - customizing or extending - and it\r\nis now much easier to follow examples and find out how to\r\nbuild your own image. The criteria on which approach to\r\nchoose were put first and forefront.\r\n\r\nExamples have been reviewed, fixed and put in a logical\r\nsequence. From the most basic ones to the most advanced,\r\nwith clear indication where the basic aproach ends and where\r\nthe \"power-user\" one starts. The examples were also separated\r\nout to separate files and included from there - also the\r\nexample Docker images and build commands are executable\r\nand tested automatically in CI, so they are guaranteed\r\nto work.\r\n\r\nFinally The build arguments were split into sections - from most\r\nbasic to most advanced and each section links to appropriate\r\nexample section, showing how to use those parameters.\r\n\r\nFixes: #14848\r\nFixes: #14255\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

documented here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/dev/PROJECT_GUIDELINES.md#support-for-backport-providers\r\n\r\n> Backport providers within 1.10.x, will be supported for critical fixes\r\nfor three months (March 17, 2021) from Airflow 2.0.0 release date (Dec\r\n17, 2020).\r\n\r\nFor the future reference, if anyone would like to build backport\r\nproviders with cherry-picking any fixes, the branch to start from is\r\n`legacy-backport-cutoff-point`. The documentation and tools to build the\r\nbackports are there, but there will be no more community releases for\r\nbackports.\r\n\r\nGood Bye Backport Providers.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

the celery executor tries to adopt task instances, and there are indeed task instances to adopt, `bulk_state_fetcher.get_many` [is called](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/90ab60bba877c65cb93871b97db13a179820d28b/airflow/executors/celery_executor.py#L478-L480), passing a map object. If the celery `result_backend` is not  an instance of BaseKeyValueStoreBackend or DatabaseBackend, the method `_get_many_using_multiprocessing` will be called. This method attempts to get the len of its parameter, but you can't take the length of a map object. So, it needs to be converted to a list (or perhaps another iterable?) first. Since there is a debug statement that first takes the len before `_get_many_using_multiprocessing` [is called](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/90ab60bba877c65cb93871b97db13a179820d28b/airflow/executors/celery_executor.py#L555), it makes sense to convert the map object to a list immediately prior even if it wasn't handled in the `else` block. \r\n\r\nI wasn't able to actually reproduce the issue with Airflow, but I was able to reproduce it with the [test_try_adopt_task_instances](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/90ab60bba877c65cb93871b97db13a179820d28b/tests/executors/test_celery_executor.py#L319-L353) test by setting the celery result backend to `rpc://` and the broker to redis.\r\n\r\ncloses:

MySQLdb and mysql-connector-python clients use different methods for getting and setting the autocommit mode. This code checks the `conn` param passed into get/set_autocommit() to see if it's a MySQLdb instance (containing the get_autocommit method) or a mysql-connector-python instance (missing get_autocommit) and makes the appropriate autocommit calls for the client.\r\n\r\nFixes #14857\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

follow-up to #14746, this applies a similar approach to convert tests to use Pytest fixtures.\r\n\r\nI managed to make all but one test to work. The one failure (marked as xfail for now) is `TestAirflowBaseViews::test_index`; somehow my conversion makes the index page to only use 8 queries instead of the previous 43. I couldn’t figure out what caused the change and would be happy for any insights.\r\n\r\nThe change does not produce any measuable time difference from my benchmarks, which is kind of expected since I mostly performed one-to-one conversion from `setUpClass` to `scope=\"class\"` and `setUp` to `scope=\"function\"`. I intend to go through the changes and try to locate any possible optimisations, but it seems the tests did not re-create expensive resources repeated to begin with.","created_at":"2021-03-17T22:08:26Z","updated_at":"2021-05-28T06:57:03Z","closed_at":"2021-04-24T05:41:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2e933bd1fe6ac56347d4f6caa28da3d7c835535f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver

Airflow is configured with update_fab_perms config setting to False,\nthen the Op, User and Viewer roles are created _before_ the permissions\nobjects are written to the database, meaning that these roles did not\ncorrectly get assigned all the permissions we asked for (the missing\npermissions are just silently not created.)\n\nBecause of the \"migrate to resource permission\" migration this problem\nis not \"disasterous\" as all most of the Permissions et al. we use are\ncreated by a migration.\n\nThis changes it so that the permissions are always created/synced before\nwe look at the roles.\n\n(Re-running sync-perm wouldn't fix this, as although the second time\naround the Permissions will exist in the DB, we see that Op role already\nhas permissions and don't make any changes, assuming that the site\noperators made such changes.)\n\n\n<!--\nThank you for contributing!

when an integration got broken, it could be broken\r\npermanently due to left-over volume. This was because when\r\nbreeze stop was called the integration were not enabled and\r\nsome volumes were not deleted.\r\n\r\nAs result, breeze sometimes could not start with integrations, due to\r\nmisterious 'unhealthy' condition of one of the integrations.\r\n\r\nThis change enables all integrations automatically when\r\nbreeze stop is called so that all volumes are removed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Call it in decorator declaration wastes performance,\r\n  and will raise error when not in an `app_context`.\r\n- It needs `perms` (otherwise it's a no-op).\r\n- 'Admin' should have all predefined

Thanks!\r\n\r\n---\r\n### My Use Case\r\n\r\nI made a plugin (_in `$AIRFLOW_HOME/plugins/`_), which mixed with web entry and RESTful API.\r\n```py\r\nfrom airflow.api_connexion import security\r\nfrom airflow.www import auth\r\nfrom airflow.www.app import csrf\r\nfrom airflow.www.views import AirflowModelView\r\n\r\nclass MyModalView(AirflowModelView):\r\n    @auth.has_access([...])\r\n    @expose('/my/modal')\r\n    def some_web_entry(self): ...\r\n\r\n    @csrf.exempt\r\n    @security.requires_access([...])\r\n    @expose('/my/modal/rest-api-for-robot/')\r\n    def some_bot_api(self): ...\r\n```\r\nThen I found airflow **worker** cannot start when it load the plugin,\r\nthe `security.requires_access` failed because not in an app context.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer `@security.requires_access` can be safely used like `@auth.has_access`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Parallel tests from #14531 created a good opportunity to\r\nreproduce some of the race conditions that cause some of the\r\nscheduler job test to be flaky.\r\n\r\nThis change is an attempt to fix three of the flaky tests\r\nthere by removing side effects between tests. The previous\r\nimplementation did not take into account that scheduler job\r\nprocesses might still be running when the test finishes and\r\nthe tests could have unintended side effects - especially\r\nwhen they were run on a busy machine.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds mechanism that stops all running\r\nschedulerJob processes in tearDown before cleaning\r\nthe database.\r\n\r\nFixes: #14778\r\nFixes: #14773\r\nFixes: #14772\r\nFixes: #14771\r\nFixes: #11571\r\nFixes: #12861\r\nFixes: #11676\r\nFixes: #11454\r\nFixes: #11442\r\nFixes: #11441\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Parallel tests from #14531 created a good opportunity to\r\nreproduce some of the race conditions that cause some of the\r\nscheduler job test to be flaky.\r\n\r\nThis change is an attempt to fix

is by far the biggest improvements of the test execution time\r\nwe can get now when we are using self-hosted runners.\r\n\r\nThis change drives down the time of executing all tests on\r\nself-hosted runners from ~ 50 minutes to ~ 13 minutes due to heavy\r\nparallelisation we can implement for different test types and the\r\nfact that our machines for self-hosted runners are far more\r\ncapable - they have more CPU, more memory and the fact that\r\nwe are using tmpfs for everything.\r\n\r\nThis change will also drive the cost of our self-hosted runners\r\ndown. Since we have auto-scaling infrastructure we will simply need\r\nthe machines to run tests for far shorter time. Since the number\r\nof test jobs we run on those self hosted runners is substantial\r\n(10 jobs), we are going to save ~ 6 build hours per one PR/merged\r\ncommit!\r\n\r\nThis also allows the developers to use the power of their\r\ndevelopment machines - when you use\r\n`./scripts/ci/testing/ci_run_airflow_testing.sh` the script\r\ndetects how many CPU cores are available and it will run as\r\nmany parallel test types as many cores you have.\r\n\r\nAlso in case of Integration tests - they require more memory to run\r\nall the integrations, so in case there is less than ~ 32 GB of RAM\r\navailable to Docker, the integration tests are run sequentially\r\nat the end. This drives stability up for machines with lower memory.\r\n\r\nOn one personal PC (64GB RAM, 8 CPUS/16 cores, fast SSD) the full\r\ntest suite execution went down from 30 minutes to 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nThere is a continuous progress information printed every 10 seconds when\r\neither parallel or sequential tests are run, and the full output is\r\nshown at the end - failed tests are marked in red groups, and succesful are\r\nmarked in green groups. This makes it easier to see and analyse errors.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

is by far the biggest improvements of the test execution time\r\nwe can get now when we are using self-hosted runners.\r\n\r\nThis change drives down the time of executing all tests on\r\nself-hosted runners from ~ 50 minutes to ~ 13 minutes due to heavy\r\nparallelisation we can implement for different test types and the\r\nfact that our machines for self-hosted runners are far more\r\ncapable - they have more CPU, more memory and the fact that\r\nwe are using tmpfs for everything.\r\n\r\nThis change will also drive the cost of our self-hosted runners\r\ndown. Since we have auto-scaling infrastructure we will simply need\r\nthe machines to run tests for far shorter time. Since the number\r\nof test jobs we run on those self hosted runners is substantial\r\n(10 jobs), we are going to save ~ 6 build hours per one PR/merged\r\ncommit!\r\n\r\nThis also allows the developers to use the power of their\r\ndevelopment machines - when you use\r\n`./scripts/ci/testing/ci_run_airflow_testing.sh` the script\r\ndetects how many CPU cores are available and it will run as\r\nmany parallel test types as many cores you have.\r\n\r\nAlso in case of Integration tests - they require more memory to run\r\nall the integrations, so in case there is less than ~ 32 GB of RAM\r\navailable to Docker, the integration tests are run sequentially\r\nat the end. This drives stability up for machines with lower memory.\r\n\r\nOn one personal PC (64GB RAM, 8 CPUS/16 cores, fast SSD) the full\r\ntest suite execution went down from 30 minutes to 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nThere is a continuous progress information printed every 10 seconds when\r\neither parallel or sequential tests are run, and the full output is\r\nshown at the end - failed tests are marked in red groups, and succesful are\r\nmarked in green groups. This makes it easier to see and analyse errors.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

base python image is only updated when manually triggered and\r\nin case of checking for upgraded dependencies in master build.\r\n\r\nWhile automated upgrade to latest Python image is good

already quite a number of times so it\r\nis time to switch to a bit different mode. Python images will only\r\nbe automatically upgraded in those cases:\r\n\r\n1) When Master CI build is run in scheduled nightly build - to check\r\n   that tests still pass for latest version of the image\r\n\r\n2) When manually refreshed with --force-pull-base-python-image\r\n\r\n3) When DockerHub official images (from tags) are built.\r\n\r\nThe procedure to refresh the images manually in our CI has been\r\nadded to the documentation.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Even though it is related, it is not the same. Docker Image is built on top of the apache-aiirflow package. Like the Helm Chart it is built on top of Docker Image.\r\n\r\nThis package has no versioning as its content is applicable to both Airflow 1.10 and Airflow 2.0. \r\n\r\nFor now, I have tried to limit the changes to the content to make sure everything was successfully migrated to the new package.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
