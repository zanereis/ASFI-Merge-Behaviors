What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a check between the R package version used and the version reported by SparkContext running in the JVM. The goal here is to warn users when they have a R package downloaded from CRAN and are using that to connect to an existing Spark cluster.\r\n\r\nThis is raised as a warning rather than an error as users might want to use patch versions interchangeably (e.g., 2.1.3 with 2.1.2 etc.)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually by changing the `DESCRIPTION`

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we alter table schema, we set the new schema to spark `CatalogTable`, convert it to hive table, and finally call `hive.alterTable`. This causes a problem in Spark 2.2, because hive bucketing metedata is not recognized by Spark, which means a Spark `CatalogTable` representing a hive table is always non-bucketed, and when we convert it to hive table and call `hive.alterTable`, the original hive bucketing metadata will be removed.\r\n\r\nTo fix this bug, we should read out the raw hive table metadata, update its schema, and call `hive.alterTable`. By doing this we can guarantee only the schema is changed, and nothing else.\r\n\r\nNote that this bug doesn't exist in the master branch, because we've added hive bucketing support and the hive bucketing metadata can be recognized by Spark. I think we should merge this PR to master too, for code cleanup and reduce the difference between master and 2.2 branch for backporting.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew regression

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen converting Pandas DataFrame/Series from/to Spark DataFrame using `toPandas()` or pandas udfs, timestamp values behave to respect Python system timezone instead of session timezone.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say we use `\"America/Los_Angeles\"` as session timezone and have a timestamp value `\"1970-01-01 00:00:01\"` in the timezone. Btw, I'm in Japan so Python timezone would be `\"Asia/Tokyo\"`.\r\n\r\nThe timestamp value from current `toPandas()` will be the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.session.timeZone\", \"America/Los_Angeles\")\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([28801], \"long\").selectExpr(\"timestamp(value) as ts\")\r\n>>> df.show()\r\n+-------------------+\r\n|                 ts|\r\n+-------------------+\r\n|1970-01-01 00:00:01|\r\n+-------------------+\r\n\r\n>>> df.toPandas()\r\n                   ts\r\n0 1970-01-01

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBefore Spark 2.x, synchronization for metastore access was protected at [line229 in ClientWrapper](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-1.6/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/client/ClientWrapper.scala#L229) (now it's at [line203 in HiveClientWrapper ](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/client/HiveClientImpl.scala#L203)). \r\n\r\nAfter Spark 2.x, `HiveExternalCatalog` was introduced by [SPARK-13080](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11293), where an extra level of synchronization was added at [line95](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/HiveExternalCatalog.scala#L95). That is, now we have two levels of synchronization: one is `HiveExternalCatalog` and the other is `IsolatedClientLoader` in `HiveClientImpl`.\r\n\r\nBut since both `HiveExternalCatalog` and `IsolatedClientLoader` are shared among all spark sessions, the extra level of synchronization in `HiveExternalCatalog` is redundant, thus can be removed.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis issue was discovered and investigated by Ohad Raviv and Sean Owen in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21657. The input data of `MapObjects` may be a `List` which has O(n) complexity for accessing by index. When converting input data to catalyst array, `MapObjects` gets element by index in each loop, and results to bad performance.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue by accessing elements via Iterator.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nusing the test script in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21657 \r\n```\r\nval BASE = 100000000\r\nval N = 100000\r\nval df =

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSql below will get all partitions from metastore, which put much burden on metastore;\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE `partition_test`(`col` int) PARTITIONED BY (`pt` byte)\r\nSELECT * FROM partition_test WHERE CAST(pt AS INT)=1\r\n```\r\nThe reason is that the the analyzed attribute `dt` is wrapped in `Cast` and `HiveShim` fails to generate a proper partition filter.\r\nThis pr proposes to take `Cast` into consideration when generate partition filter.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nTest added.\r\nThis pr proposes to use analyzed

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR generates the Java code to directly get a value for a primitive type array in ColumnVector without using an iterator for table cache (e.g. dataframe.cache). This PR improves runtime performance by eliminating data copy from column-oriented storage to InternalRow in a SpecificColumnarIterator iterator for primitive type. This is a follow-up PR of #18747.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this implementation is to add `ColumnVector.UnsafeArray` to keep `UnsafeArrayData` for an array in addition to `ColumnVector.Array` that keeps `ColumnVector` for a Java primitive array for an array.\r\n\r\nBenchmark result: **21.4x**\r\n\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_121-8u121-b13-0ubuntu1.16.04.2-b13 on Linux

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\njira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22381\r\n\r\nDuring test with https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22331, I found it might be a good idea to include the possible options in a StringParam.\r\nA `StringParam` extends `Param[String]` and allow user to specify the valid options in Array[String] (case insensitive).\r\n\r\nSo far it can help achieve three goals:\r\n\r\n1.  Make the StringParam aware of its possible options and support native validations.\r\n2.  StringParam can list the supported options in exception message when user input wrong value.\r\n     before: `$parent parameter $name given invalid value $value.`\r\n     after: `$parent parameter $name given invalid value $value. Supported options: auto, normal, l-bfgs`\r\n    \r\n3.  Allow automatic unit test coverage for case-insensitive String param. (built into checkParam)\r\n\r\nand IMO it also decrease the code redundancy and make it more maintainable.\r\n\r\nThe StringParam is designed to be completely compatible with existing Param[String], just with the extra logic for supporting options, which means we don't need to convert all Param[String] to StringParam until we feel comfortable to do that.\r\n\r\nThe PR contains the minimum changes required and use NaiveBayes and LinearRegression as examples. \r\n\r\nThe PR intentionally leave SharedParamsCodeGen untouched as it's not necessary for now, which can be easily added if StringParam sounds good. Also more unit tests can be added.\r\n\r\nAbout how to compare the String param value against candidates in the algorithms, in total I got four different options:\r\n1. use `equalsIgnoreCase` for each comparison between param and candidates;\r\n2. use `$(param).tolowerCase...` for each String param access and keep all the candidates as lowercase.\r\n3. revise $() in `Params` to return `StringParam.toLowerCase..`. for `Param[String]`, but keep `getOrDefault`unchanged.\r\n4. add a new $lc(param) in Params specifically for Param[String], which returns the lowercase param. But this will break binary compatibility so I put it in `PipelineStage` for now.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nStrengthen existing unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-28T19:32:27Z","updated_at":"2019-09-16T20:31:00Z","closed_at":"2019-09-16T20:31:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7c82e85c89b917ff7a68c5197565e8ce970cf102","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19599/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19599/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19599/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b79d8db9406fbd29ef46c8a74f8591d2aace45ee","head":{"label":"hhbyyh:stringparam","ref":"stringparam","sha":"b79d8db9406fbd29ef46c8a74f8591d2aace45ee","user":{"login":"hhbyyh","id":7981698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODE2OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7981698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh","html_url":"https://github.com/hhbyyh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29568485,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTU2ODQ4NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"hhbyyh/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hhbyyh","id":7981698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODE2OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7981698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh","html_url":"https://github.com/hhbyyh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hhbyyh/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR eliminates redundant null check in generated code for extracting an element from complex types `GetArrayItem`, `GetMapValue`, and `GetArrayStructFields`. Since these code generation does not take care of `nullable` in `DataType` such as `ArrayType`, the generated code always has `isNullAt(index)`.  \r\nThis PR avoids to generate `isNullAt(index)` if `nullable` is false in `DataType`.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n```\r\n    val nonNullArray = Literal.create(Seq(1), ArrayType(IntegerType, false))\r\n    checkEvaluation(GetArrayItem(nonNullArray, Literal(0)),

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nEqui-height histogram is one of the state-of-the-art statistics for cardinality estimation, which can provide better estimation accuracy, and good at cases with skew data.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to improve join estimation based on equi-height histogram. The difference from basic estimation (based on ndv) is the logic for computing join cardinality and the new ndv after join.\r\n\r\nThe main idea is as follows:\r\n1. find overlapped ranges between two histograms from two join keys;\r\n2. apply the formula `T(A IJ B) = T(A) * T(B) / max(V(A.k1), V(B.k1))` in each overlapped range.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUnder the current execution mode of Python UDFs, we don't well support Python UDFs as branch values or else value in CaseWhen expression. The execution of batch Python UDFs evaluates the UDFs in an operator at all rows. It breaks the semantics of the conditional expressions and causes failures under some cases:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import Row\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, udf, when\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import IntegerType\r\n\r\ndf = sc.parallelize([Row(x=5), Row(x=0)]).toDF()\r\nf = udf(lambda value: 10 // int(value), IntegerType())\r\nwhenExpr1 = when((col('x') > 0), f(col('x')))\r\ndf.select(whenExpr1).collect() ## Raise a division by zero error\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven from performance perspective, to evaluate all Python UDFs used in conditional expressions can be waste of computing, if only small portion of rows satisfies the conditions.\r\n\r\nThe patch fixes the issue by adding an extra argument for Python UDFs used with conditional expressions. The argument takes the evaluated value of conditions. In Python side, we can optionally run Python UDFs based on the condition value.\r\n\r\nQuestion: How about vectorized Python UDFs?\r\n\r\nSeems it doesn't make much sense to do similar with vectorized UDFs. Vectoroized UDFs process input as batch of rows, instead of single row at one time. We can't simply optionally run vectorized UDFs only on valid rows. But as pandas Series can be more resistant to such error and evaluate to `inf` for shown case, it should be less serious than batch UDFs. As vectorized Python UDFs are not in releases, maybe we can consider to disable using it with conditional expression and don't worry breaking compatibility.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded python tests.\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-27T23:56:40Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:21:13Z","closed_at":"2017-10-31T04:15:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1dd9061cd20f993dbb7db94664eb716bb3de5d5b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19592/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19592/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19592/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/138a366349c36b92a89d0b033baf28aedb380688","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-22347","ref":"SPARK-22347","sha":"138a366349c36b92a89d0b033baf28aedb380688","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

change adds a new launcher that allows applications to be run\r\nin a separate thread in the same process as the calling code. To\r\nachieve that, some code from the child process implementation was\r\nmoved to abstract classes that implement the common functionality,\r\nand the new launcher inherits from those.\r\n\r\nThe new launcher was added as a new class, instead of implemented\r\nas a new option to the existing SparkLauncher, to avoid ambigous\r\nAPIs. For example, SparkLauncher has ways to set the child app's\r\nenvironment, modify SPARK_HOME, or control the logging of the\r\nchild process, none of which apply to in-process apps.\r\n\r\nThe in-process launcher has limitations: it needs Spark in the\r\ncontext class loader of the calling thread, and it's bound by\r\nSpark's current limitation of a single client-mode application\r\nper JVM. It also relies on the recently added SparkApplication\r\ntrait to make sure different apps don't mess up each other's\r\nconfiguration, so config isolation is currently limited to cluster mode.\r\n\r\nI also chose to keep the same socket-based communication for in-process\r\napps, even though it might be possible to avoid it for in-process\r\nmode. That helps both implementations share more code.\r\n\r\nTested with new and existing unit tests, and with a simple app that\r\nuses the launcher; also made sure the app ran fine with older launcher\r\njar to check binary compatibility.","created_at":"2017-10-27T22:47:07Z","updated_at":"2018-01-05T22:34:04Z","closed_at":"2017-12-28T23:03:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"03d1fd70cec1cc477e86ea09777e9a73e533c8c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19591/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19591/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19591/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5dd5b5db112ac99f3e70ce50db5e5196379c3610","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-11035","ref":"SPARK-11035","sha":"5dd5b5db112ac99f3e70ce50db5e5196379c3610","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI've been working on this issue, and I would like to get your feedback on the following approach. The idea is that instead of failing in `TaskSetManager.abortIfCompletelyBlacklisted`, when a task cannot be scheduled in any executor but dynamic allocation is enabled, we will register this task with `ExecutorAllocationManager`. Then `ExecutorAllocationManager` will request additional executors for these \"unscheduleable tasks\" by increasing the value returned in `ExecutorAllocationManager.maxNumExecutorsNeeded`. This way we are counting these tasks twice, but this makes sense because the current executors don't have any slot for these tasks, so we actually want to get new executors that are able to run these tasks. To avoid a deadlock due to tasks being unscheduleable forever, we store the timestamp when a task was registered as unscheduleable, and in `ExecutorAllocationManager.schedule` we abort the application if there is some task that has been unscheduleable for a configurable age threshold. This way we give an opportunity to dynamic allocation to get more executors that are able to run the tasks, but we don't make the application wait forever.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThis is WIP for discussion, unit tests will be provided later on","created_at":"2017-10-27T22:03:19Z","updated_at":"2018-11-04T07:02:41Z","closed_at":"2018-11-04T07:02:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"34ca54528ccc302ef259c704606322da02b5a1ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19590/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19590/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19590/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7baa51e5cbafc93a0fe56eb11d8c76c69b51c893","head":{"label":"juanrh:hortala-SPARK-22148","ref":"hortala-SPARK-22148","sha":"7baa51e5cbafc93a0fe56eb11d8c76c69b51c893","user":{"login":"juanrh","id":895341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTM0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/895341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanrh","html_url":"https://github.com/juanrh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanrh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanrh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanrh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanrh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanrh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanrh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanrh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanrh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanrh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29204988,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTIwNDk4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"juanrh/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juanrh","id":895341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTM0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/895341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanrh","html_url":"https://github.com/juanrh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanrh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanrh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanrh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanrh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanrh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanrh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanrh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanrh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juanrh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juanrh/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBecuase they are all the same class for an iterator.  So there is no need write class information for every record in the iterator. We only need write the class information once at the serialization beginning, also only need read the class information once for deserialization.\r\n\r\nIn this patch, we separate the serialization of class and object for an iterator serialized by Kryo. This can improve the performance of the serialization and deserialization, and save the space.\r\n\r\nTest case:\r\n```scala\r\n    val conf = new SparkConf().setAppName(\"Test for serialization\")\r\n    val sc = new SparkContext(conf)\r\n\r\n    val random = new Random(1)\r\n    val data = sc.parallelize(1 to 1000000000).map { i =>\r\n      Person(\"id-\" + i, random.nextInt(Integer.MAX_VALUE))\r\n    }.persist(StorageLevel.OFF_HEAP)\r\n\r\n    var start = System.currentTimeMillis()\r\n    data.count()\r\n    println(\"First time: \" + (System.currentTimeMillis() - start))\r\n\r\n    start = System.currentTimeMillis()\r\n    data.count()\r\n    println(\"Second time: \" + (System.currentTimeMillis() - start))\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nTest result:\r\n\r\nThe size of serialized:\r\nbefore: 34.3GB\r\nafter: 17.5GB\r\n\r\n| before(cal+serialization)| before(deserialization)| after(cal+serialization)| after(deserialization) |\r\n| ------| ------ | ------ | ------ | \r\n| 63869| 21882|  45513| 15158|\r\n| 59368| 21507|  51683| 15524|\r\n| 66230| 21481|  62163| 14903|\r\n| 62399| 22529|  52400| 16255|\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUnder the current execution mode of Python UDFs, we don't support Python UDFs as branch values or else value in CaseWhen expression. The execution of batch/vectorized Python UDFs evaluates the UDFs in an operator at once. It breaks the semantics of the conditional expressions and causes failures:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F, Row, types\r\n\r\ndef divideByValue():\r\n    def fn(value): return 10 / int(value)\r\n    return F.udf(fn, types.IntegerType())\r\n\r\ndf = sc.parallelize([Row(x=5), Row(x=0)]).toDF()\r\n\r\nx = F.col('x')\r\ndf2 = df.select(F.when((x > 0), divideByValue()(x)))\r\ndf2.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt might not be easy to let it support conditional execution. It also doesn't make much sense in the context of vectorized Python UDFs.\r\n\r\nTo reduce confusion from end users, this patch disables the usage of Python UDFs in conditional expressions such as CaseWhen, and suggests to implement the condition logic in Python UDFs. It can be very easy to incorporate the condition logic of CaseWhen into the Python UDFs, e.g. for the above example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef divideByValue():\r\n    def fn(value): return 10 /

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen a task finishes with error due to a fetch error, then DAGScheduler unregisters the shuffle blocks hosted by the serving executor (or even all the executors in the failing host, with external shuffle and spark.files.fetchFailure.unRegisterOutputOnHost enabled) in the shuffle block directory stored by MapOutputTracker, that then increments its epoch as a result. This event is only signaled to the other executors when a new task with a new epoch starts in each executor. This means that other executors reading from the failed executors will retry fetching shuffle blocks from them, even though the driver already knows those executors are lost and those blocks are now unavailable at those locations. This impacts job runtime, specially for long shuffles and executor failures at the end of a stage, when the only pending tasks are shuffle reads.\r\nThis could be improved by pushing the epoch update to the executors without having to wait for a new task. In the attached patch I sketch a possible solution that sends the updated epoch from the driver to the executors by piggybacking on the executor heartbeat response. ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator, RetryingBlockFetcher and BlockFetchingListener are modified so blocks locations are checked on each fetch retry. This doesn't introduce additional traffic, as MapOutputTrackerWorker.mapStatuses is shared by all tasks running on the same Executor, and the lookup of the new shuffle blocks directory was going to happen anyway when the new epoch is detected during the start of the next task.\r\nI would like to know the opinion of the community on this approach.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests, tests in Yarn

are two somewhat unrelated things going on in this patch, but\r\nboth are meant to make integration of individual UI pages later on\r\nmuch easier.\r\n\r\nThe first part is some tweaking of the code in the listener so that\r\nit does less updates of the kvstore for data that changes fast; for\r\nexample, it avoids writing changes down to the store for every\r\ntask-related event, since those can arrive very quickly at times.\r\nInstead, for these kinds of events, it chooses to only flush things\r\nif a certain interval has passed. The interval is based on how often\r\nthe current spark-shell code updates the progress bar for jobs, so\r\nthat users can get reasonably accurate data.\r\n\r\nThe code also delays as much as possible hitting the underlying kvstore\r\nwhen replaying apps in the history server. This is to avoid unnecessary\r\nwrites to disk.\r\n\r\nThe second set of changes prepare the history server and SparkUI for\r\nintegrating with the kvstore. A new class, AppStatusStore, is used\r\nfor translating between the stored data and the types used in the\r\nUI / API. The SHS now populates a kvstore with data loaded from\r\nevent logs when an application UI is requested.\r\n\r\nBecause this store can hold references to disk-based resources, the\r\ncode was modified to retrieve data from the store under a read lock.\r\nThis allows the SHS to detect when the store is still being used, and\r\nonly update it (e.g. because an updated event log was detected) when\r\nthere is no other thread using the store.\r\n\r\nThis change ended up creating a lot of churn in the ApplicationCache\r\ncode, which was cleaned up a lot in the process. I also removed some\r\nmetrics which don't make too much sense with the new code.\r\n\r\nTested with existing and added unit tests, and by making sure the SHS\r\nstill works on a real cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-26T22:37:37Z","updated_at":"2017-11-06T18:38:43Z","closed_at":"2017-11-06T14:48:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"289f288e70ece0fb727cf41dc34cbde50c4ff01f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19582/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19582/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19582/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/537c7b4bf27e1392fd4868db688f7d2f48baa3a5","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-20644","ref":"SPARK-20644","sha":"537c7b4bf27e1392fd4868db688f7d2f48baa3a5","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe often see the issue of Spark jobs stuck because the Executor Allocation Manager does not ask for any executor even if there are pending tasks in case dynamic allocation is turned on. Looking at the logic in Executor Allocation Manager, which calculates the running tasks, it can happen that the calculation will be wrong and the number of running tasks can become negative.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit test\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-26T17:33:36Z","updated_at":"2017-10-31T16:52:51Z","closed_at":"2017-10-31T16:52:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"355ee06afbc7a320b6178c221c84397bc7f8a02b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19580/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19580/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19580/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8abaa2cbc4c54dd728b7493ddfedabddd8c8ba7b","head":{"label":"sitalkedia:skedia/fix_stuck_job","ref":"skedia/fix_stuck_job","sha":"8abaa2cbc4c54dd728b7493ddfedabddd8c8ba7b","user":{"login":"sitalkedia","id":11507549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTA3NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11507549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia","html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51496876,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTQ5Njg3Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"sitalkedia/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sitalkedia","id":11507549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTA3NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11507549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia","html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a regression introduced by #14207. After Spark 2.1, we store the inferred schema when creating the table, to avoid inferring schema again at read path. However, there is one special case: overlapped columns between data and partition. For this case, it breaks the assumption of table schema that there is on ovelap between data and partition schema, and partition columns should be at the end. The result is, for Spark 2.1, the table scan has incorrect schema that puts partition columns at the end. For Spark 2.2, we add a check in CatalogTable to validate table schema, which fails at this case.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, a simple and safe approach is to fallback to old behavior when overlapeed columns detected, i.e. store empty schema in metastore.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew regression

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt's possible that users create a `Dataset`, and call `collect` of this `Dataset` in many threads at the same time. Currently `Dataset#collect` just call `encoder.fromRow` to convert spark rows to objects of type T, and this encoder is per-dataset. This means `Dataset#collect` is not thread-safe, because the encoder uses a projection to output the object to a re-usable row.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this problem, by creating a new projection when calling `Dataset#collect`, so that we have the re-usable row for each method call, instead of each Dataset.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nN/A","created_at":"2017-10-25T23:09:45Z","updated_at":"2017-10-27T00:54:02Z","closed_at":"2017-10-27T00:54:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"33fd431f08d3e5dd340a3c2ca534fac25778361a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19577/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19577/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19577/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dfcdb2362f51b2b139340150ea581266cf61d1c3","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:encoder","ref":"encoder","sha":"dfcdb2362f51b2b139340150ea581266cf61d1c3","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPreviously, ORC file format cannot write a correct schema in case of empty dataframe. Instead, it creates an empty ORC file with **empty** schema, `struct<>`. So, Spark users cannot write and read back ORC files with non-empty schema and no rows. This PR uses new Apache ORC 1.4.1 to create an empty ORC file with a correct schema. Also, this PR uses ORC 1.4.1 to infer schema always.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```scala\r\nscala> val emptyDf = Seq((true, 1, \"str\")).toDF(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\").limit(0)\r\nscala> emptyDf.write.format(\"orc\").mode(\"overwrite\").save(\"/tmp/empty\")\r\nscala> spark.read.format(\"orc\").load(\"/tmp/empty\").printSchema\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Unable to infer schema for ORC. It must be specified manually.;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.read.format(\"orc\").load(\"/tmp/empty\").printSchema\r\nroot\r\n |-- a: boolean (nullable = true)\r\n |-- b: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- c: string (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with newly added test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the conversion error when reads data from a PostgreSQL table that contains columns of `uuid[]`, `inet[]` and `cidr[]` data types. \r\n\r\nFor example, create a table with the uuid[] data type, and insert the test data.\r\n```SQL\r\nCREATE TABLE users\r\n(\r\n    id smallint NOT NULL,\r\n    name character varying(50),\r\n    user_ids uuid[],\r\n    PRIMARY KEY (id)\r\n)\r\n\r\nINSERT INTO users (\"id\", \"name\",\"user_ids\") \r\nVALUES (1, 'foo', ARRAY\r\n    ['7be8aaf8-650e-4dbb-8186-0a749840ecf2'\r\n    ,'205f9bfc-018c-4452-a605-609c0cfad228']::UUID[]\r\n)\r\n```\r\nThen it will throw the following exceptions when trying to load the data.\r\n```\r\njava.lang.ClassCastException: [Ljava.util.UUID;

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently we use table properties('totalSize') to judge if to use broadcast join. Table properties are from metastore. However they can be wrong. Hive sometimes fails to update table properties after producing data successfully(e,g, NameNode timeout from https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/branch-1.2/metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/MetaStoreUtils.java#L180). If 'totalSize' in table properties is much smaller than its real size on filesystem(e.g. HDFS), Spark can launch broadcast join by mistake and suffer OOM.\r\nCould we add a defense config and check the size from filesystem(e.g. HDFS) when 'totalSize' is below `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold`\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTests added","created_at":"2017-10-23T13:05:05Z","updated_at":"2018-12-22T23:24:44Z","closed_at":"2018-12-22T23:24:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"188f1261952fa36116d99340e3fc072d616e68c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19560/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19560/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19560/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/78b34bd7b79550b23730e1c9cdf06620e52b66f2","head":{"label":"jinxing64:SPARK-22334","ref":"SPARK-22334","sha":"78b34bd7b79550b23730e1c9cdf06620e52b66f2","user":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":78330400,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3ODMzMDQwMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"jinxing64/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64/spark","description":"Mirror

We need to disable that but we would still need a function signature for roxygen2 to build with.\r\n\r\nWith glm it's pulling in the function definition (ie. \"usage\") from the stats::glm function. Since this is \"compiled in\" when we build the source package into the .Rd file, when it changes at runtime or in CRAN check it won't match the latest signature. The solution is not to pull in from stats::glm since there isn't much value in doing that (none of the param we actually use, the ones we do use we have explicitly documented them)\r\n\r\nAlso with attach we are changing to call dynamically.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually.\r\n- [x] check documentation output - yes\r\n- [x] check help `?attach` `?glm` - yes\r\n- [x] check on other platforms, r-hub, on r-devel

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn Spark 2.2.0, `spark.sql.hive.caseSensitiveInferenceMode` has a critical issue by default. \r\n\r\n- [SPARK-19611](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19611) uses `INFER_AND_SAVE` at 2.2.0 since Spark 2.1.0 breaks some Hive tables backed by case-sensitive data files.\r\n\r\n  > This situation will occur for any Hive table that wasn't created by Spark or that was created prior to Spark 2.1.0. If a user attempts to run a query over such a table containing a case-sensitive field name in the query projection or in the query filter, the query will return 0 results in every case.\r\n\r\n- However, [SPARK-22306](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22306) reports this also corrupts Hive Metastore schema by removing bucketing information (BUCKETING_COLS, SORT_COLS) and changing owner. This is undesirable side-effects. Hive Metastore is a shared resource and Spark should not corrupt it by default. \r\n\r\n- Since Spark 2.3.0 supports Bucketing, BUCKETING_COLS and SORT_COLS look okay at least. However, we need to figure out the issue of changing owners. Also, we cannot backport bucketing patch into `branch-2.2`. We need to verify this option with more tests before releasing 2.3.0.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to recover that option back to `NEVER_INFO` like Spark 2.2.0 by default. Users can take a risk by enabling `INFER_AND_SAVE` by themselves.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the existing tests.","created_at":"2017-10-22T18:07:02Z","updated_at":"2017-11-02T15:40:05Z","closed_at":"2017-11-02T15:40:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"24db757f1757a2c626a7cae620f20084d48d3d1b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19552/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19552/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19552/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a256627dbc2772e69cd0f9f2aa43b384165e3657","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-22329","ref":"SPARK-22329","sha":"a256627dbc2772e69cd0f9f2aa43b384165e3657","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"ca2a780e7c4c4df2488ef933241c6e65264f8d3c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen [SPARK-19261](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19261) implements `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMNS`, ORC data source is omitted due to SPARK-14387, SPARK-16628, and SPARK-18355. Now, those issues are fixed and Spark 2.3 is [using Spark schema to read ORC table instead of ORC file schema](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/e6e36004afc3f9fc8abea98542248e9de11b4435). This PR enables `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMNS` for ORC data source.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the updated and added test

manually tested this patch by:\r\n\r\n1. Confirming that my Spark application failed to launch with the error reported in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22319.\r\n2. Applying this patch and confirming that the app no longer fails to launch, even when I have not manually run `kinit` on the host.\r\n\r\nPresumably we also want integration tests for secure clusters so that we catch this sort of thing.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a very trivial PR, simply marking `strategies` in `SparkPlanner` with the `override` keyword for clarity since it is overriding `strategies` in `QueryPlanner` two levels up in the class hierarchy. I was reading through the code to learn a bit and got stuck on this fact for a little while, so I figured this may be helpful so that another developer new to the project doesn't get stuck where I was.\r\n\r\nI did not make a JIRA ticket for this because it is so trivial, but I'm happy to do so to adhere to the contribution guidelines if required.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. E.g. unit tests, integration tests, manual tests)\r\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screenshot; otherwise, remove this)\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to mark the existing warnings as `DeprecationWarning` and print out warnings for deprecated functions.\r\n\r\nThis could be actually useful for Spark app developers. I use (old) PyCharm and this IDE can detect this specific `DeprecationWarning` in some cases:\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6477701/31762664-df68d9f8-b4f6-11e7-8773-f0468f70a2cc.png\" height=\"45\" />\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6477701/31762662-de4d6868-b4f6-11e7-98dc-3c8446a0c28a.png\" height=\"70\" />\r\n\r\nFor console usage, `DeprecationWarning` is usually disabled (see https://docs.python.org/2/library/warnings.html#warning-categories and https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html#warning-categories):\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> import warnings\r\n>>> filter(lambda f: f[2] == DeprecationWarning, warnings.filters)\r\n[('ignore', <_sre.SRE_Pattern object at 0x10ba58c00>, <type 'exceptions.DeprecationWarning'>, <_sre.SRE_Pattern object at 0x10bb04138>, 0), ('ignore', None, <type 'exceptions.DeprecationWarning'>, None, 0)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nso, it won't actually mess up the terminal much unless it is intended.\r\n\r\nIf this is intendedly enabled, it'd should as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> import warnings\r\n>>> warnings.simplefilter('always', DeprecationWarning)\r\n>>>\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql import functions\r\n>>> functions.approxCountDistinct(\"a\")\r\n.../spark/python/pyspark/sql/functions.py:232: DeprecationWarning: Deprecated in 2.1, use approx_count_distinct instead.\r\n  \"Deprecated in 2.1, use approx_count_distinct instead.\", DeprecationWarning)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese instances were found by:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd python/pyspark\r\ngrep -r \"Deprecated\" .\r\ngrep -r \"deprecated\" .\r\ngrep -r \"deprecate\" .\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested.","created_at":"2017-10-19T09:06:24Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:41:20Z","closed_at":"2017-10-24T03:47:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3ade3f4011b1d010dc191bdb2e2a6f2927d934ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19535/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19535/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19535/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5ac0697bf17be37de7ec3a7c5268c2b208ac49ee","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:deprecated-warning","ref":"deprecated-warning","sha":"5ac0697bf17be37de7ec3a7c5268c2b208ac49ee","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe often see the issue of Spark jobs stuck because the Executor Allocation Manager does not ask for any executor even if there are pending tasks in case dynamic allocation is turned on. Looking at the logic in Executor Allocation Manager, which calculates the running tasks, it can happen that the calculation will be wrong and the number of running tasks can become negative.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe current join estimation logic is only based on basic column statistics (such as ndv, etc). If we want to add estimation for other kinds of statistics (such as histograms), it's not easy to incorporate into the current algorithm:\r\n1. When we have multiple pairs of join keys, the current algorithm computes cardinality in a single formula. But if different join keys have different kinds of stats, the computation logic for each pair of join keys become different, so the previous formula does not apply.\r\n2. Currently it computes cardinality and updates join keys' column stats separately. It's better to do these two steps together, since both computation and update logic are different for different kinds of stats.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nOnly refactor, covered by existing tests.","created_at":"2017-10-19T03:07:57Z","updated_at":"2017-10-31T10:27:05Z","closed_at":"2017-10-31T10:16:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7bfaaee2848320edc36e20fcfe5856a5ddb819a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19531/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19531/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19531/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a2dbb8eefacf560ff5e7090baa3796b2353daed2","head":{"label":"wzhfy:join_est_refactor","ref":"join_est_refactor","sha":"a2dbb8eefacf560ff5e7090baa3796b2353daed2","user":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66051854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjA1MTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"wzhfy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is the fix for the master branch applied to the 1.6 branch.  My (unnamed) company will be using Spark 1.6 probably for another year.   We have been blocked from having Spark 1.6 on our workstations until CVE-2017-7678 is patched, which SPARK-20393 does.  I realize there will not be an official Spark 1.6.4 release, but it still seems wise to keep the code there patched for those who are stuck on that version.  Otherwise I imagine several forks duplicating 1.6 compliance and security fixes.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe patch came with unit tests.  The test build passed.  Manual testing on one of the effected screens showed the newline character removed.  Screen display was the same regardless (html ignores newline characters).  \r\n![screenshot from 2017-10-18 14-18-17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12421739/31739388-50db67c0-b413-11e7-8928-c5c874380835.png)\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n\r\nThe patch itself is from previous pull requests associated to SPARK-20939.  My original \"work\" was actions on what to apply to branch 1.6. and I license the work to the project under the project’s open source

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a new class `OneHotEncoderEstimator` which extends `Estimator`. The `fit` method returns `OneHotEncoderModel`.\r\n\r\nCommon methods between existing `OneHotEncoder` and new `OneHotEncoderEstimator`, such as transforming schema, are extracted and put into `OneHotEncoderCommon` to reduce code duplication.\r\n\r\n### Multi-column support\r\n\r\n`OneHotEncoderEstimator` adds simpler multi-column support because it is new API and can be free from backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n### handleInvalid Param support\r\n\r\n`OneHotEncoderEstimator` supports `handleInvalid` Param. It supports `error` and `keep`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new test suite `OneHotEncoderEstimatorSuite`.","created_at":"2017-10-18T09:04:52Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:35:09Z","closed_at":"2017-12-31T23:32:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f70889b48fcbe487f2ac4383a320c5743256a4f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19527/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19527/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19527/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e94496a5c8b08fdc437e9623dfba2b0d80998263","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-13030","ref":"SPARK-13030","sha":"e94496a5c8b08fdc437e9623dfba2b0d80998263","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror
