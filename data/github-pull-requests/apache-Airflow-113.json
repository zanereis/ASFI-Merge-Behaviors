added two improvements to the `RedshiftDataOperator`:\r\n1. Better error reporting. Before my changes, all you get in case of an error is just a status (`FAILURE`). It's not very helpful. I added the whole response in the exception, so it will be printed in the logs and it will give a possibility to troubleshoot problems easily.\r\n2. I added a `return_sql_result` optional parameter. By default it's `False`, so it's a backward-compatible change. If it's `True` operator will return a result of a SQL query from the `execute` method. It means that this result will be available through xcom variables. It may be handy if you need to get some small portions of data (or metadata) from Redshift. For example, I'm running `show table` query to get a DDL of some table and create a temporary copy of

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/17469\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\nThis PR attempts to correct the issues in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/21404 which was reverted.\r\n\r\nMuch of the logic is the same - however, there is one edge case that we catch - when nodes within an EdgeModifier's streams are in the same TaskGroup. When this happens, we should _not_ be converting the nodes in an EdgeModifier's streams to their respective TaskGroups because that will cause a cycle.\r\n\r\nI'll admit that the logic in `_convert_streams_to_task_groups` is a bit convoluted and can probably be refactored further. The idea here is to try to identify if the nodes within the streams are part of the same TaskGroup. If they are, we choose not to convert them to TaskGroups. Otherwise, we will convert them to TaskGroups.\r\n\r\n**I'm looking for feedback in `_convert_streams_to_task_groups`. I'm hoping there's a better way to write this logic.**\r\n\r\n## Test Cases\r\n\r\nI copied the same unit tests from https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/21404. They are pretty robust. I also ran all the test DAGs from this PR as well and saw that they worked as expected. I added a few test dags of my own to capture the case where a label is created inside a TaskGroup and the XComArg case. In a later commit, I can add these other test dags as well to the unit tests showing that a cycle is no longer detected.\r\n\r\nLabels Test DAGs:

PR include some improvements and clarifications:\r\n- Based on my experience use simple http scheduler healthcheck required  less resources rather run in shell airflow cli.\r\n- Added grace period for healthchecks, which also reduce resource usage during startup airflow services\r\n- Increase healthchecks intervals, for the same reason - reduce resource usage.\r\n- Set port mapping as string\r\n- Added clarification about `_PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS`, users might ignore warning during services startup however they should noticed it when add modification in

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/29323\r\n\r\n### Bug and Fix explained\r\nSo when a DAG file is deleted, the now removed DAGs are deleted during DAG directory refreshing. The DagProcessorManager creates a list of \"alive\" dag files and then should disable DAGs and delete serialized_dag entries.\r\n\r\nThe `remove_deleted_dags` method should delete serialized dags with either no `processor_subdir` or a matching `processor_subdir`. \r\n```python\r\n session.execute(\r\n            cls.__table__.delete().where(\r\n                and_(\r\n                    cls.fileloc_hash.notin_(alive_fileloc_hashes),\r\n                    cls.fileloc.notin_(alive_dag_filelocs),\r\n                    or_(\r\n                        cls.processor_subdir is None,\r\n                        cls.processor_subdir == processor_subdir,\r\n                    ),\r\n                )\r\n            )\r\n        )\r\n\r\n```\r\nHowever, I've found with MySQL and Sqlite, `  cls.processor_subdir is None` does not match serialized dags with null `processor_subdir`. Based on this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5602918/select-null-values-in-sqlalchemy/44679356#44679356, I was able to resolve this issue by using the `_is` method instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was resulting in the webserver still showing deleted DAGs (from a DAG link), and the dataset and dependency graphs still showing deleted DAGs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

corresponding issue: #26854\r\n\r\nI have added the `fail_fast` parameter for DAGs. When this is set, every running task within the DAG will be forcefully failed immediately and any task that hasn't already completed will be set to `SKIPPED`. \r\n\r\nThe way I approached this was, within the `handle_failure` method of the `TaskInstance` class, if a task reaches a FAILED state and its DAG is in `fail_fast` mode, then it fails every task that is currently running within its DAG run. \r\n\r\nI have added unit tests and have also tested several different fail_fast DAGs. I have confirmed that when a task within these DAGs fails, the currently running tasks within them immediately fail and all other non-completed tasks get skipped, thus quickly stopping the DAG.\r\n\r\nOne suggestion of how to approach this was to modify `base_executor` to kill all tasks within a DAG once one task fails. The problem that I found within this approach was that, first of all there are several different executors which all store which tasks are running, queued, or completed differently, making it hard to make a unified function that kills all running tasks on all types of executors. More importantly, through my tests I have found that the executor often doesn't have full information of all the tasks in a dag run when one task fails. What this means is that, if a task fails, the executor may not yet have full information about all the tasks currently running within that DAG, and all tasks currently queued, and thus cannot properly fail the DAG. \r\n\r\nLet me know if there are flaws to my approach or if there are any changes that should be added.\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-07T19:06:28Z","updated_at":"2023-07-31T17:28:30Z","closed_at":"2023-04-23T16:44:23Z","merged_at":"2023-04-23T16:44:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"4c5cebf04555aa7b892a50a85f2f488acc4c057b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172800071,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwMDcx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:new-feature","name":"type:new-feature","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

open-api-schema-validator 0.4.3 made RFC3339  validation of the date-time fields mandatory and this revealed problems in our test URLs - the '+' was not url-encoded and it was replaced with space - thus the dates passed were not valid RFC3339 date-time specifications.\r\n\r\nThis however revealed one more problem. The rfc3339-validator package is automatically installed by the open-api-schema-validator, but when installed, it also adds validation to date-time fields validated by the Params of ours - for example naive date-time parameters are not supported any more (but they were in the past).\r\n\r\nThis might introduce breaking changes for users who use non-valid date-time parameters - however we should consider that as a bugfix, and accidental support, because the date-time schema should expect RFC3339 formatted date time.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

is a new setting/version of git in GitHub Actions that started checking the ownership of the Git repository. Since in case of the provider commands we run them inside docker image as root user (this is in order to isolate the provider package building from the main CI environment), the owner of such directory is different (runner user) than the user that runs the git command (root).\r\n\r\nThis change marks the current git directory for such commands as safe, regardles from the discrepancy.\r\n\r\nThis config is global and run inside the image, so it is safe to leave it after methods complete as containers are torn-down after completing package preparation.\r\n\r\nThis PR also improves diagnostics. Previously the `git remote add` output was redirected to dev null as there was no way it could fail, but this turned to be false - the output of the `git remote add` commnd is now also printed for diagnostics.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#28514 change added capability of getting trace errors for the command by swapping redirection of stderr and stdout, but debug output for github_output file remoined in stderr.\r\n\r\nThis was no problem in most cases as rich did not produce color codes for stderr redirection and github_output was able to parse it properly - and each line in the GITHHUB_OUTPUT was simply duplicated.\r\n\r\nHowever, when number of labels was big, rich split the message and it caused Invalid format message.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR fixes some glitches that I found in the contribution of AIP-50 which slipped into the code at point of final review. I detected these during demo of the feature and hereby what to provide a fix.\r\n\r\nThree glitches corrected with this PR:\r\n\r\n- The DAG embedded javascript demo of the color slides in the example_params_ui_tutorial were broken\r\n- The HTML dict formatting of the box/section \"Generated Configuration JSON\" in the new trigger UI (e.g. in \"example_params_ui_tutorial\" or other DAGs with a submit form was misaligned. setTimeout() event handler generates JavaScript error\r\n- A TypeError was raised in JavaScript on first form submission when no \"Select Recent Configurations\" was rendered on page.\r\n\r\nHow to test that this fix works:\r\n\r\n- Check out this branch, clean your dev env and re-compile www assets\r\n- Start a local instance and open the browser to http://localhost:28080/trigger?dag_id=example_params_ui_tutorial\r\n- See that (assuming you never ran the DAG) no JavaScript error is reported in JavaScript Developer Console\r\n- Click on the gray section bar \"Generated Configuration JSON\" and see that dict formatting is \"nice\" (no mis-aligned text compared to main)\r\n- Click on the gray section bar \"Special advanced stuff with form fields\" and use the sliders to adjust demo of color picker. See that color and text value adjusts when changing sliders and other way around if you change color code the sliders adjust. (was broken on main)\r\n\r\ncloses: #26215\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-04T22:53:07Z","updated_at":"2023-10-28T08:23:45Z","closed_at":"2023-02-11T14:38:34Z","merged_at":"2023-02-11T14:38:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"9c6f83bb6f3e3b57ae0abbe9eb0582fcde265702","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2057471696,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDU3NDcxNjk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/changelog:skip","name":"changelog:skip","color":"a8f731","default":false,"description":"Changes that should be skipped from the changelog (CI, tests, etc..)"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

applied by this PR:\r\n1. Bump version of `jsonschema` to 4+, in this version `jsonschema` drop support `strict-rfc3339` and only use `rfc3339-validator` if it installed. This mostly for avoid to use another rfc3339 validation method.\r\n2. Make `rfc3339-validator` as core dependency\r\n3. Convert valid ISO8601 values to RFC3339\r\n4.

AIP-44 we need to send the TaskInstance object to worker for execution. Currently this object type doesn't  support serialization(only SimpleTaskInstance does). \r\n\r\nThis change is mainly about new way to construct TaskInstance  `from_dict` - which requires changing the constructor into `from_task` and refactoring all usages.\r\n\r\nNote that deserialized TaskInstance will not have ORM state (so will not be able to refresh state automatically from DB etc), but

a generic approach to check for single threaded executors that can support DBs like sqlite.\r\n\r\nAn `is_single_threaded` property was added to the base executor interface (with a default of False)

This keeps the same behaviour as previous but without core aireflow code statically coupling to the above two executors.  \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

the `KubernetesExecutor` supports method `get_task_log()` (in `main` branch). However, the number of lines to read is hard-coded to be 100.\r\n\r\nIt can be imagined that in many cases people may need more logs. And it would be nice to make this number of log lines to read from worker pod configurable. So that users can adjust according to their certain environment.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

defined volumes are missing in the [pod-template-file](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/helm-chart/1.8.0rc1/chart/files/pod-template-file.kubernetes-helm-yaml) which will make pod spawning fail on clusters where readOnlyRootFilesystem is True and a volume for airflow home has been set globally. Workaround would be to set that volume in each system's extraVolumes and extraVolumeMounts but that would greatly reduce the functionality of global volumes and volume mounts.\r\nThis PR fixes that

using Listener API after a couple of Airflow releases for OpenLineage plugin, we’ve found some of the aspects of the API lacking for that purpose.\r\n\r\n1. The API is canonically specified to call plugins when TaskInstanceState changes. This is very similar, but not 100% what we need - which is getting notified before and after task execution. That has some nice properties for Airflow - for example, SqlAlchemy event system can be utilized to notify listeners, instead of 10s of direct calls if needed - but not necessarily for us. What we need is an API that calls it “just before” and “just after” task execution, while providing it as close data as actual Operator execution code has. Since state changes - particularly for TaskInstanceState.RUNNING - aren’t that close (in code) to what we need, but is very close at execution, we need to do additional work, duplicating what Airflow does with\r\n    1. Mapped tasks. On RUNNING, Mapped tasks aren’t yet “mapped”. This means we have to handle them specially, whereas we’d not need to do it if we were called later in the run process.\r\n    2. Jinja templates aren’t yet rendered. This means we have to render them themselves, which is not a lightweight process and can call the Airflow database.   \r\n2. Second issue is connected to being directly called from the SqlAlchemy event system. We’re being called from inside a database connection. Currently, extractors perform a variety of tasks, which include calling external systems or Airflow DB in the meantime for various reasons. This means we can’t just execute code in the meantime - it fails the db transaction - we have to run it in some other thread, while unblocking the current one. This means we either have to block the thread - which right now is being done - or unblock it and risk data races. And when we block it with a timeout we risk even more problems.\r\n3. Another issue is that we’re not always getting actual TaskInstance objects in our plugin. What we’re getting is a detached SqlAlchemy that does not always have actual fields set. The issue https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/21157 explains it in more depth. Basically, if not careful, Airflow changes can impact objects we receive in OL without noticing on the Airflow side.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes all of the above, while preserving overall Pluggy API.","created_at":"2023-02-01T15:36:47Z","updated_at":"2023-02-27T21:38:49Z","closed_at":"2023-02-03T14:40:03Z","merged_at":"2023-02-03T14:40:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"624520db47f736af820b4bc834a5080111adfc96","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

defined volumes are missing in the [pod-template-file](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/helm-chart/1.8.0rc1/chart/files/pod-template-file.kubernetes-helm-yaml) which will make pod spawning fail on clusters where readOnlyRootFilesystem is True and a volume for airflow home has been set globally.

knowledge to know what's terminal in the long list of possible statuses:\r\n\r\n- available\r\n- available, prep-for-resize\r\n- available, resize-cleanup\r\n- cancelling-resize\r\n- creating\r\n- deleting\r\n- final-snapshot\r\n- hardware-failure\r\n- incompatible-hsm\r\n- incompatible-network\r\n- incompatible-parameters\r\n- incompatible-restore\r\n- modifying\r\n- paused\r\n- rebooting\r\n- renaming\r\n- resizing\r\n- rotating-keys\r\n- storage-full\r\n- updating-hsm\r\n\r\nSo I'm taking this poor man's approach that'd at least allow us to get a sense of what happened from looking at the logs.\r\n\r\n(also, since the sensor is very generic, I think it'd be super hard to do because `storage-full` for instance could be terminal in some cases, except if we run a step to free space and are waiting on the cluster leaving that state ? So many possibilities...)","created_at":"2023-01-31T20:18:02Z","updated_at":"2023-02-01T16:53:08Z","closed_at":"2023-02-01T16:52:12Z","merged_at":"2023-02-01T16:52:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"efc8857d55b96f1fdb6cf4fd767276f5c541e038","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eladkal","id":45845474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODQ1NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45845474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal","html_url":"https://github.com/eladkal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"o-nikolas","id":65743084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzQzMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65743084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas","html_url":"https://github.com/o-nikolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

Background:\r\nThe first time `airflow.configuration` is imported triggers all the code that creates and validates the `conf` object to run (since that code lives at the module level in `configuration.py`). At the moment that first import of `airflow.configuration` just _happens_ to be in `airflow.settings` (when settings is imported in `airflow.__init__`). This has a critical side effect that no code in `conf` can use or import any code that uses `airflow.settings` because this would cause an import cycle (since `airflow.settings` is what imported `ariflow.configuration` to then trigger the `conf` object construction). But a TONNE of things in airflow use `airflow.settings`, so it's very difficult to add or change code in `conf` without needing to import something that uses `airflow.settings`.\r\n\r\n#### What this change does:\r\nThis tactical code change intentionally imports `airflow.configuration` in `airflow.__init__` **before** `airflow.setttings` imports it. This allows the construction and validation of the `conf` object to happen **outside the scope of the `airflow.settings` module** which means it's much easier to add/modify code in `conf` without causing import cycles (which I need to do for another code change, which started this whole investigation).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

was looking at this code because we got a throttling error in a system test.\r\nThe error was coming from the list_ operation on the job names.\r\nThis boto call has a cap at 100 results per call, and the function wanted all the jobs, so we were doing repeated calls with the `NextToken` set.\r\nLooking online, it seems boto starts to throw throttling errors around 70/80 chained calls like this with the default config (i.e. around 7-8000 jobs).\r\nThe problem is that sagemaker jobs cannot be \"cleaned\", they stay there forever, so listing all of them is an increasingly longer operation, doomed to fail.\r\n\r\nLooking further, it turned out that we didn't _really_ needed to list all the jobs. It was used for 2 things: checking if the job name already existed (which can be done in a single `describe` call), and get a number to append to the job name if needed.\r\nTo make this a lot cheaper and not O(nb jobs), I propose that we use a random number instead of a monotonically increasing sequence to rename jobs in case of collision.","created_at":"2023-01-30T17:58:56Z","updated_at":"2023-02-27T19:22:18Z","closed_at":"2023-02-27T19:22:18Z","merged_at":"2023-02-27T19:22:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"df4abcbcfed2ddca3ad06d67b1fb721de9e1755d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"o-nikolas","id":65743084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzQzMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65743084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas","html_url":"https://github.com/o-nikolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

recent asset compilation fix #29185 broke --dev-mode flag in Breeze. The start-airflow command checks if the output file is successfully deleted, but in case of dev-mode - it is never deleted because asset compilation runs in background continuously.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to use different output file for --dev-mode asset compilation and to make sure it will also delete the regular output (potentially from the previous run).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

were a few changes to our CI workflows that have not been reflected in the documentation:\r\n\r\n* conditional behaviour for non-main branches (some jobs and tests are skipped when running in v2_* branch)\r\n* Breeze is not \"new\" any more - there is only one Breeze left\r\n* unit and integration tests have been split to separate jobs\r\n* \"summarize warnings\" job has been added to summarize warnings from all tests\r\n* \"testing building airflow packages job has been added\r\n* There are only \"React WWW tests\" now after consolidating UI code into one folder\r\n* a job has been added to test if images build quickly\r\n* a job has been added to test if Windows git cloning works\r\n* a job has been added to test if ARM CI images build properly\r\n* a jonb for testing docker-compose quick start was missing in the documentation\r\n\r\nThis PR synchronizes all the changes and updates CI.rst with more context and explanation for the conditional behaviours and with added missing jobs
