this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-19T16:51:46Z","updated_at":"2017-09-27T21:28:40Z","closed_at":"2017-07-26T01:12:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"13dd8b43dd35d72d76a2cb4c2560787dbec415b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3594/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3594/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3594/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/12a95178163ef3bf56f49f6276194e2ab0068999","head":{"label":"charlesccychen:test-branch","ref":"test-branch","sha":"12a95178163ef3bf56f49f6276194e2ab0068999","user":{"login":"charlesccychen","id":1055135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTUxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1055135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen","html_url":"https://github.com/charlesccychen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61401292,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTQwMTI5Mg==","name":"beam","full_name":"charlesccychen/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"charlesccychen","id":1055135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTUxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1055135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen","html_url":"https://github.com/charlesccychen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charlesccychen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/charlesccychen/beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---","created_at":"2017-07-19T12:46:10Z","updated_at":"2017-07-24T02:54:12Z","closed_at":"2017-07-24T02:54:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"155a4f0e08e8cc3311fc6e7cae7c1e01d9210ecf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3593/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3593/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3593/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/6823936b0aa2d4027bdb35ab649703fb0bff3b7a","head":{"label":"peihe:reshuffle-tests","ref":"reshuffle-tests","sha":"6823936b0aa2d4027bdb35ab649703fb0bff3b7a","user":{"login":"peihe","id":10201797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjAxNzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10201797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe","html_url":"https://github.com/peihe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52831526,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjgzMTUyNg==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"peihe/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"peihe","id":10201797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjAxNzk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10201797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe","html_url":"https://github.com/peihe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peihe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/peihe/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nR: @kennknowles \r\nBesides, I saw that the current `WindowFnTestUtils` has no test. I guess that is because all windows use `WindowFnTestUtils` to test themselves. So I did not add any test. That is said, the methods added in that PR are actually called by the current windows tests but always with a `null` value in  `TimestampedValue`. I was thinking I could wait for that PR https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3286 to be merged. Indeed it defines a `CustomWindowFn` in `WindowTest` that relies on values for window assignment. I could then add a test of this `CustomWindowFn` with the new `WindowFnTestUtils`.\r\n@kennknowles

would open each file while splitting, in createForSubrangeOfFile, in order to fetch the file's codec, sync marker and writer schema. This is extremely slow with a large number of files, and unnecessary - none of this information is needed for splitting, only for reading. This PR moves that code into the reader: now, when we open an AvroReader, we first read the file metadata.\r\n\r\nThis effectively moves the overhead of opening every file from {sequentially during splitting} to {in parallel inside every work item}, which is much better and gets rid of the sequential bottleneck in splitting.\r\n\r\nThere's a few more minor simplifications (e.g. removing unnecessary lazy initialization and such) and immaterial renames to AvroSource in this PR. AvroSource is not a public API surface class (is marked Experimental), so this is fine.\r\n\r\nR: @reuvenlax \r\nCC: @matthewlang

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCurrently quickstart link in README redirect to Java.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-1234] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-1234` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYou can find documentation on how users will invoke this at https://docs.google.com/document/d/153J9jPQhMCNi_eBzJfhAg-NprQ7vbf1jNVRgdqeEE8I/edit?usp=sharing, which will be moved to the online documentation.\r\n\r\nFull design doc for this feature is up at

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-1234] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-1234` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-1234] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-1234` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe default message size that can be sent or received over gRPC is 4MB. For the fn API case we do buffering at a layer above, so setting the message size at the gRPC level to a max value.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-1234] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-1234` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-1234] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-1234` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and\r\neasily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-1234] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-1234` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOne the modes of operation of the impending mergebot - actually, the simplest mode - is to merge commits exactly as they appear in the pull request.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a JIRA issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like [BEAM-1234] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles, where you replace BEAM-1234 with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Run mvn clean verify to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf). (Didn't file an ICLA, because I don't think this is a big enough contribution to warrant one. Let me know if I'm wrong.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis pull request replaces the logic that separates input by newline delimiters with a default set of delimiters, a method for users to define custom delimiters, and logic that splits input by any set of custom delimiters.\r\n\r\nExamples of use are included in a javadocs addition to TextIO.\r\n\r\nPotential solution to

Beam to read from kinesis stream. `KinesisIO` provides two overloaded methods - `withClientProvider` to provide AWS credentials or implement an interface - `KinesisClientProvider`  to pass `AWSKinesisClient` as described on [here](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/javadoc/2.0.0/)\r\n\r\n```\r\nThere's also possibility to start reading using arbitrary point in time - in this case you need to provide Instant object:\r\n p.apply(KinesisIO.read()\r\n     .from(\"streamName\", instant)\r\n     .withClientProvider(new KinesisClientProvider() {\r\n

@lukecwik, can you please take a look?\r\n\r\nWindows OS currently has three problems reading file specs from pipeline options.\r\n1. The scheme parsing fails to recognize local drive as local filesystem.\r\n2. It fails if we add “file:” to start of path (also true for Linux)\r\n3. It doesn’t recognize glob (*) in file matching.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes problem number 1 and 2, not 3. Because of that, more tests run in Windows OS start passing, but the glob tests still fail.\r\n\r\nThe approach is to set LocalFileSystem as default, remove \"file:\", and get rid of any forward-slashes in the beginning of paths for Windows OS, since Windows Path Parser rejects slashes before the drive specification.\r\n\r\nFrom the examples linked in the JIRA issue:\r\ninputFile=c:/Users/lcwik/Desktop/beamRC4Java/word-count-beam/pom.xml (Still works)\r\ninputFile=c:/Users/lcwik/Desktop/beamRC4Java/word-count-beam/pom.x* (Still doesn’t work, because of glob)\r\ninputFile=file:/c:/Users/lcwik/Desktop/beamRC4Java/word-count-beam/pom.xml (Starts working)\r\ninputFile=file:///c:/Users/lcwik/Desktop/beamRC4Java/word-count-beam/pom.xml (Starts

But this may be a scenario that we want to discourage anyway. What do you think?\r\n* I feel that the `'/Do' ` relabeling of the ParDo in line 525 could also be reconsidered to something more intuitive for the users (we've had bugs filed because users can't figure out which step owns their counters).\r\n* Also, the `side_pval.pvalue.producer.full_label.split('/')[-1]` operation I'm adding in line 507 seems a bit sketchy, but I believe it should work in every
