you for contributing to Apache OpenNLP.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with OPENNLP-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically main)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn clean install at the root opennlp folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the LICENSE file, including the main LICENSE file in opennlp folder?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the NOTICE file, including the main NOTICE file found in opennlp folder?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\n\r\nsee https://github.com/apache/opennlp-models/pull/9\r\n\r\nRational is to avoid something like\r\n\r\n```java\r\n try {\r\n                final

(draft) PRs introduces a more aggressive caching strategy in the cached feature generator, which doesn't rely on `==`.\r\n\r\nHowever, the eval results are a bit odd for the Conll02

**but** the results for conll02 for **dutch** are odd (see changes in eval f1 scores).\r\n\r\nThey are sometimes slightly better but at the same time decrease in some scenarios. \r\n\r\nI am actually wondering, why we don't see such changes in f-measure for Spanish. Therefore, I am opening this PR, so you can also investigate what is going on here.\r\n\r\n@mawiesne is also having a look here, but we would appreciate some additional 👁️ 👁️

Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- x] Does your PR title start with OPENNLP-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically main)?\r\n\r\n- x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn clean install at the root opennlp folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the LICENSE file, including the main LICENSE file in opennlp folder?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the NOTICE file, including the main NOTICE file found in opennlp folder?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\n\r\nWe don't need a mock framework for achieving this behaviour. We can just return an anonymous class with the value needed. No need for a 3rd party framework.\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-27T11:40:40Z","updated_at":"2024-06-30T16:18:13Z","closed_at":"2024-06-30T16:17:45Z","merged_at":"2024-06-30T16:17:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"03daaf08af7e7200fa9a2a692b195737d5b26630","assignee":{"login":"rzo1","id":13417392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDE3Mzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13417392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1","html_url":"https://github.com/rzo1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rzo1","id":13417392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDE3Mzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13417392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1","html_url":"https://github.com/rzo1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1651647887,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjUxNjQ3ODg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/labels/dependencies","name":"dependencies","color":"0366d6","default":false,"description":"Pull

2018-10-09)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Support Java 9, 10, and 11.</li>\n<li>Fix an ExceptionInInitializerError when plugin is used on Java 11 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/issues/401\">401</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.0.0</h2>\n<h3>Revamped authentication support</h3>\n<p>Integrates <a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-client/blob/dba55b17d09d4a15aa9d26884b22b230d49fce64/docs/user_manual.md#authentication-to-private-registries\">revamped support for authentication from\ndocker-client</a> into the plugin, making it possible for\nthe plugin to be more flexible in regards to authentication credentials used\nwhen pushing/pulling/building images.</p>\n<p>Previous versions of the plugin had the limitation of using the same\nRegistryAuth header for all images, regardless of what registries they came\nfrom.</p>\n<p>In this version, the docker-maven-plugin will automatically use any\nauthentication present in the docker-cli configuration file at <code>~/.dockercfg</code>\nor <code>~/.docker/config.json</code>.</p>\n<p>Additionally the plugin will enable support for Google Container Registry if it\nis able to successfully load <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials\">Google's &quot;Application Default Credentials&quot;</a>.\nThe plugin will also load Google credentials from the file pointed to by the\nenvironment variable <code>DOCKER_GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS</code> if it is defined. Since GCR\nauthentication requires retrieving short-lived access codes for the given\ncredentials, support for this registry is baked into the underlying\ndocker-client rather than having to first populate the docker config file\nbefore running the plugin.</p>\n<p>Lastly, authentication credentials can be explicitly configured in your pom.xml\nand in your Maven installation's <code>settings.xml</code> file as part of the\n<code>&lt;servers&gt;&lt;/servers&gt;</code> block.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/pull/339\">339</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/commit/c34270f4a96ee17675b196861baa06421e0f0fdf\"><code>c34270f</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release v1.2.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/commit/960ed96fe04e1eb0008f6dcdfa9edab8cf17a522\"><code>960ed96</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/issues/438\">#438</a> from spotify/dxia/network-mode</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/commit/80ad9461ba906d0a7f700c1d2b95fedc8ef1e072\"><code>80ad946</code></a> Support 'networkmode' option when building docker image</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/commit/aa7fab35d6bab8022361577b6395177b21b4f8d0\"><code>aa7fab3</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/commit/6dd542b668591cad8915f47667dcf37352161847\"><code>6dd542b</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release v1.2.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/commit/6db655f5966dcbb826d2aa549f9a25345c5efac6\"><code>6db655f</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/issues/430\">#430</a> from spotify/dxia/upgrade-docker-client</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/commit/0ab7e3c886212c4e78c543f43055f70e60a77058\"><code>0ab7e3c</code></a> Ignore two findbugs violations</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/commit/bbe5ce228e995613ff298e38cc3e35c5cd13ab62\"><code>bbe5ce2</code></a> Upgrade findbugs-maven-plugin from 3.0.0 to 3.0.5</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/commit/c93a56b28c4736dcbb22da96c112653e2dedeb91\"><code>c93a56b</code></a> Temporarily disable checkstyle</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/commit/cd24c738299fb669aad4caed8166749365138f66\"><code>cd24c73</code></a> Upgrade docker-client dep from 8.14.1 to 8.16.0</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/compare/v0.4.13...v1.2.2\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=com.spotify:docker-maven-plugin&package-manager=maven&previous-version=0.4.13&new-version=1.2.2)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

v1.18.0</h2>\n<h2>Announcements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Windows ARM32 support has been dropped at the source code level</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Python version &gt;=3.8 is now required for build.bat/build.sh</strong> (previously &gt;=3.7). <em>Note: If you have Python version &lt;3.8, you can bypass the tools and use CMake directly.</em></li>\n<li><strong>The <a href=\"https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.microsoft.onnxruntime/onnxruntime-mobile\">onnxruntime-mobile</a> Android package and onnxruntime-mobile-c/onnxruntime-mobile-objc iOS cocoapods are being deprecated</strong>. Please use the <a href=\"https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.microsoft.onnxruntime/onnxruntime-android\">onnxruntime-android</a> Android package, and onnxruntime-c/onnxruntime-objc cocoapods, which support ONNX and ORT format models and all operators and data types. <em>Note: If you require a smaller binary size, a custom build is required. See details on creating a custom Android or iOS package on <a href=\"https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/build/custom.html#custom-build-packages\">Custom build | onnxruntime</a>.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Build System &amp; Packages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>CoreML execution provider now depends on coremltools.</li>\n<li>Flatbuffers has been upgraded from 1.12.0 → 23.5.26.</li>\n<li>ONNX has been upgraded from 1.15 → 1.16.</li>\n<li>EMSDK has been upgraded from 3.1.51 → 3.1.57.</li>\n<li>Intel neural_speed library has been upgraded from v0.1.1 → v0.3 with several important bug fixes.</li>\n<li>There is a new onnxruntime_CUDA_MINIMAL CMake option for building ONNX Runtime CUDA execution provider without any operations apart from memcpy ops.</li>\n<li>Added support for Catalyst for macOS build support.</li>\n<li>Added initial support for RISC-V and three new build options for it: <code>--rv64</code>, <code>--riscv_toolchain_root</code>, and <code>--riscv_qemu_path</code>.</li>\n<li>Now you can build TensorRT EP with protobuf-lite instead of the full version of protobuf.</li>\n<li>Some security-related compile/link flags have been moved from the default setting → new build option: <code>--use_binskim_compliant_compile_flags</code>. <em>Note: All our release binaries are built with this flag, but when building ONNX Runtime from source, this flag is default OFF.</em></li>\n<li>Windows ARM64 build now depends on PyTorch CPUINFO library.</li>\n<li>Windows OneCore build now uses “Reverse forwarding” apisets instead of “Direct forwarding”, so onnxruntime.dll in our Nuget packages will depend on kernel32.dll. <em>Note: Windows systems without kernel32.dll need to have reverse forwarders (see <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/apiindex/api-set-loader-operation\">API set loader operation - Win32 apps | Microsoft Learn</a> for more information).</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Core</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added ONNX 1.16 support.</li>\n<li>Added additional optimizations related to Dynamo-exported models.</li>\n<li>Improved testing infrastructure for EPs developed as shared libraries.</li>\n<li>Exposed Reserve() in OrtAllocator to allow custom allocators to work when session.use_device_allocator_for_initializers is specified.</li>\n<li>Improved lock contention due to memory allocations.</li>\n<li>Improved session creation time (graph and graph transformer optimizations).</li>\n<li>Added new SessionOptions config entry to disable specific transformers and rules.</li>\n<li>[C# API] Exposed SessionOptions.DisablePerSessionThreads to allow sharing of threadpool between sessions.</li>\n<li>[Java API] Added CUDA 12 Java support.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved 4bit quant support:\n<ul>\n<li>Added HQQ quantization support to improve accuracy.</li>\n<li>Implemented general GEMM kernel and improved GEMV kernel performance on GPU.</li>\n<li>Improved GEMM kernel quality and performance on x64.</li>\n<li>Implemented general GEMM kernel and improved GEMV performance on ARM64.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Improved MultiheadAttention performance on CPU.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Execution Providers</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>TensorRT</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for TensorRT 10.</li>\n<li>Finalized support for DDS ops.</li>\n<li>Added Python support for user provided CUDA stream.</li>\n<li>Fixed various bugs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>CUDA</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support of multiple CUDA graphs.</li>\n<li>Added a provider option to disable TF32.</li>\n<li>Added Python support for user provided CUDA stream.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

you for contributing to Apache OpenNLP.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with OPENNLP-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically main)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn clean install at the root opennlp folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the LICENSE file, including the main LICENSE file in opennlp folder?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the NOTICE file, including the main NOTICE file found in opennlp folder?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\n\r\nUpdates some missed `PENN` format cases in the evaluation test data. In addition, if `POSTaggerNameFeatureGenerator` is used for NameFinder (i.e. defined via XML), we only get a POSModel and need to guess the format of it before creating the `POSTagger`. Therefore, I updated the mapper with a static method for guessing this type based on a given POSModel. This might be useful for other cases as well.\r\n\r\nSadly, ASF Jenkins is currently broken, so we cannot trigger a manual run, see

adjusts TwoPassDataIndexer to make use of JDK's built-in `CheckedOutputStream` / `CheckedInputStream` for checksum ([CRC32c](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/zip/CRC32C.html)) computations\r\n- removes untested class `HashSumEventStream` which is just a wrapper for calling a slow toString() in Event to get some bytes to use for the computation of a checksum\r\n- provides a HashSumEventStream replacement: `ChecksumEventStream` which makes use of the faster CRC32c checksum computation, avoiding cryptographic hash functions such as MD5\r\n- adds JUnit tests for ChecksumEventStream\r\n\r\nNote(s)\r\n-\r\n1. A _full_ OpenNLP build is consistently faster (about 3-4s) on my local machine (57s vs. 61s => ~ -7%) . \r\n2. The effect should be greater when processing large(r) training corpora. \r\n3. We should see a difference in a bare metal EVAL build run.\r\n\r\nTasks\r\n-\r\nThank you for contributing to Apache OpenNLP.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Interned Strings are stored in the JVM's permanent generation, which has a small fixed size (seems to be about 83 MB on modern 64-bit JVMs: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/vmoptions-jsp.html)\r\n\r\nSo if we have huge `StringLists` or `Dictionaries`, users need to increase `-XX:MaxPermSize=` option to avoid an

PR aims to fix three tests. \r\n\r\nModule: opennlp-tools\r\n```\r\nopennlp.tools.dictionary.DictionaryAsSetCaseInsensitiveTest.testEquals\r\nopennlp.tools.dictionary.DictionaryAsSetCaseInsensitiveTest.testEqualsDifferentCase\r\nopennlp.tools.dictionary.DictionaryAsSetCaseSensitiveTest.testEquals\r\n```\r\n\r\n**REASON AND FIX:**\r\n\r\nThe tests fail because in the `equals` method designed for comparing elements within a Set, the consideration extends to handle the ordering of elements as well.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/opennlp/blob/dab19af803e9139b57b972eb4e1af4c978d2ff3f/opennlp-tools/src/main/java/opennlp/tools/dictionary/Dictionary.java#L356\r\n\r\nBut the `entrySet` here is a HashSet which doesn't maintain a constant order as mentioned in the [Java_17_documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/HashSet.html).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/opennlp/blob/dab19af803e9139b57b972eb4e1af4c978d2ff3f/opennlp-tools/src/main/java/opennlp/tools/dictionary/Dictionary.java#L95\r\n\r\n\r\nThe error message is as follows:\r\n\r\n> org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: <[1a, 1b]> but was: <[1b, 1a]>\r\nat opennlp.tools.dictionary.DictionaryAsSetCaseInsensitiveTest.testEquals(DictionaryAsSetCaseInsensitiveTest.java:121)\r\n\r\n> org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: <[1a, 1b]> but was: <[1B, 1A]>\r\nat opennlp.tools.dictionary.DictionaryAsSetCaseInsensitiveTest.testEqualsDifferentCase(DictionaryAsSetCaseInsensitiveTest.java:142)\r\n\r\n> org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: <[1a, 1b]> but was: <[1b, 1a]>\r\nat opennlp.tools.dictionary.DictionaryAsSetCaseSensitiveTest.testEquals(DictionaryAsSetCaseSensitiveTest.java:121)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe solution involves modifying the assert statements to verify the presence of all elements without taking their order into account. \r\n\r\n**REPRODUCE:**\r\n\r\nThis was found by using the [NonDex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) tool.\r\n\r\nThe following command can be used to replicate the failures and validate the fix:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.7-SNAPSHOT:nondex -Dtest=opennlp.tools.dictionary.DictionaryAsSetCaseInsensitiveTest#testEquals\r\n```\r\n\r\n**ENVIRONMENT:**\r\n\r\n> OS: Mac\r\n> Version: Sonoma 14.0\r\n> Java: openjdk version \"17.0.9\"\r\n> Maven: Apache Maven 3.6.3\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been
