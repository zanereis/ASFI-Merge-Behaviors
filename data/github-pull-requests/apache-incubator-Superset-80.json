change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis is the first portion of a larger bug issue of retaining a query's saved status when refreshing the page in sql lab. In order to create this we needed to create a foreign key in the tab state view that links it to the saved query. \r\n\r\nThis migration does that, and the subsequent logic is here: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/17771\r\n\r\nBenchmark\r\n\r\n```Current version of the DB is c53bae8f08dd\r\n\r\nRunning benchmark will downgrade the Superset DB to bb38f40aa3ff and upgrade to c53bae8f08dd again.

SUMMARY\r\nA first step in the direction of adding support for non-temporal x-axes to ECharts line/area/bar/step/scatter charts. When the feature flag is enabled, a new control \"X-Axis\" shows up which accepts any type of column, be it temporal, numerical or categorical. For new charts the control is mandatory, but old (temporal) charts will still work. Other changes:\r\n- Remove the \"Time-series\" prefix from all ECharts timeseries charts when \r\n- make formula annotations work with numeric x-axes\r\n- clean up some TS types/interfaces that had fallen out of sync with the post processing API in the backend\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOTS\r\nWhen the feature flag is enabled, the chart picker now shows all old ECharts time-series charts without the prefix (the descriptions are also updated to reflect that the chart is now \"generic\"):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/148917030-02acb68d-5169-4ea4-82df-baf39f86e73a.png)\r\n\r\nBar chart v2 (previously Time-series bar chart) now works with non-temporal x-axis:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/148917393-17d190e8-dcd9-439d-aafc-94795fce034a.png)\r\n\r\nAnother example; Area chart v2, with the x-axis labels rotated 45 degrees (previously Time-series area chart):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/148918335-1f26c0e9-3f7e-4262-8526-0eca70630852.png)\r\n\r\n### VIDEO\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/148947353-9a027210-a9e4-42ab-93b5-bf356261f359.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Enable the `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` feature flag\r\n2. Open the chart picker and notice all \"Time-series\" charts have been replaced with a more generic name \"Time-series line chart\" - > \"Line chart\"\r\n3. Drop a categorical column in the \"x axis\" control\r\n4. Notice that a line chart is created with a non-temporal x-axis\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWaterfall charts are useful for understanding how an initial value (like net income) is affected by a series of positive and negative changes.\r\n\r\nFor example, we can see the trend of personal annual income. Here we use the year as the series.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/147865825-75c07e06-9694-4d73-bf9b-0624e0cdff20.png)\r\nMoreover, we can use the value in breakdowns to add additional data to the chart. It adds the contributors to increases or decreases for each series.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/147865827-436421e4-5d88-4c5c-af23-1697cec67e4f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nAdd support for [Azure Data Explorer (Kusto)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-explorer/). My team at @dodopizza has built and maintained the Kusto dialect for SQLAlchemy. It allows us to add a new Kusto engine spec.\r\n\r\nKusto can handle two dialects: SQL and KQL. Currently, we provide full support for the SQL dialect (SELECT queries, no DML) and experimental support for the KQL (work in progress). For more details, you may check [sqlalchemy-kusto](https://github.com/dodopizza/sqlalchemy-kusto) repo.\r\n\r\nWe are using SQL dialect in production at our company and working on full support for KQL dialect.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nTo test manually you may connect to the Kusto database and run some queries in the SQL Lab against it. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, `sqlalchemy-kusto` includes dialect tests.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: [#10646](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/10646)\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAdds authentication while calling superset/warm_up_cache endpoint with config for `CACHE_WARMUP_USER`\r\nChanges warm up url from chart's explore url to superset/warm_up_cache\r\nFixes mypy errors\r\n\r\nThis does not cache thumbnails, which could be beneficial for some users.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nIt was failing to cache data, as auth was missing and chart's explore url won't call data endpoint(/explore_json or /data) as requests library does not render javavscript.\r\nNow it directly calls superset/warm_up_cache which correctly caches data if caching is set up.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nEnable data caching from config\r\nAdd cache warm config in CeleryConfig -> CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE as below\r\n```\r\n'cache-warmup-setting': {\r\n                'task': 'cache-warmup',\r\n                'schedule': timedelta(minutes=1),\r\n                'kwargs': {'strategy_name': 'dummy'},\r\n            },\r\n```  \r\nsetup celery beat and worker.\r\ncheck data getting cached correctly every minute.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval

hierarchical traversability to pie charts and bar charts.\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis is an attempt at bringing https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/14688 and https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1120 up-to-date with the latest Superset mono repo and extending the feature to work both with echarts/pie and nvd3/distbar.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nSee video on https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/14688\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCreate either a bar chart or pie chart.  In the chart editor, select \"ENABLE DRILL DOWN.\"  Add multiple columns to the \"GROUP BY\" field that have a natural hierarchy to them and ensure the order of columns listed reflects the intended hierarchy.  Add an appropriate metric (usually COUNT(id) or similar).  Observe that only the first column in the hierarchy is reflected in the rendered chart.  Observe that clicking one field in the chart adds the selected field to the applied filters and that the second column in the \"GROUP BY\" hierarchy is now displayed.  Observe that selecting a field when the chart is at its deepest level in the hierarchy clears all selected filters and returns the chart to the original state.  Observe that saving the chart and adding it to a dashboard results in identical functionality as described above.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently, the Explore state is being stored in the URL to allow users to preserve their current interactions in case of a refresh and also to transfer context between the dashboard and Explore. The problem with this approach is that when the size of the state is big, it provokes URL length problems with the major browsers.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution in this PR is to store the Explore state on the server-side and keep in the URL only a secure key that gives access to the stored content. To do that, we'll extend the current chart endpoint with an additional path that supports the storage of information in the form of key-value entries. By making this endpoint relative to the main resource we can reuse the security model and access grants.\r\n\r\nThe additional endpoint and the supported operations are:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST api/v1/chart/<id>/form_data\r\n\r\nBODY \r\n{\r\n   // Any type of JSON supported text.\r\n   value: <string>,\r\n}\r\n\r\nRESPONSE\r\n{\r\n   // The key generated on the server-side\r\n   key: <string>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nPUT api/v1/chart/<id>/form_data/<key>\r\n\r\nBODY\r\n{\r\n   // Any type of JSON supported text.\r\n   value: <string>,\r\n}\r\n\r\nRESPONSE\r\n{\r\n   // The result of the operation\r\n   message: <string>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nGET api/v1/chart/<id>/form_data/<key>\r\n\r\nRESPONSE\r\n{\r\n   // Any type of JSON supported text.\r\n   value: <string>,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nDELETE api/v1/chart/<id>/form_data/<key>\r\n\r\nRESPONSE\r\n{\r\n   // The result of the operation\r\n   message: <string>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the endpoints accept an optional query parameter called `dataset_id` that is used for the cases when a chart is not saved yet but we want to preserve the state. In this case, the chart ID shall be set to 0:\r\n```\r\nPOST api/v1/chart/0/form_data?dataset_id=<id>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe keys are generated on the server-side using the https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html#secrets.token_urlsafe function and the value can be any JSON supported text.\r\n\r\nTo store the key-value entries, this PR uses [Flask-Caching](https://flask-caching.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which enables support to different backends like [Redis](https://redis.io/), [Memcached](https://memcached.org/), file system, etc. It also allows the configuration of expiration times for the stored entries in order to discard the ones that are not being used anymore and optimize the required storage space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR also allows a configuration to preserve actively accessed entries by renewing the expiration time every time a value is retrieved.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1 - Execute Python tests\r\n2 - All tests should pass\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nAllow users to force a screenshot (bypass the cache) on reports that send charts.\r\n\r\nWe're not enabling this for dashboards yet, since it still needs backend support.\r\n\r\nFor alerts, this is always on for charts, and off for dashboards (for perf reasons, and also because it's not implemented).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-12-12 at 12-46-09  DEV

What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Create a report, toggle the new checkbox.\r\n2. Check that `force_screenshot` is updated accordingly in the DB, or run celery and check that screenshot URLs have `force=true` or `force=false`.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nAdd a new column `force_screenshot` to the reports/alerts model. For alerts with charts this is always set to true. For reports and alerts with dashboards this is currently set to false, and is made configurable for reports in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/17855.\r\n\r\nWhen the flag is true, when generating a screenshot for the alert/report the cache will be bypassed.\r\n\r\nDepends on https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/17695.\r\n\r\n### MIGRATION\r\n\r\nDB migration adds a new column `force_screenshot`, set to true for existing alerts with  charts, false otherwise.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\n\r\nCurrent: 0.34 s\r\n10+: 0.35 s\r\n100+: 0.39 s\r\n1000+: 0.74 s\r\n10000+: 3.58 s\r\n100000+: 32.59 s\r\n1000000+: 453.84 s\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Create a report and a alert.\r\n2. Run `SELECT force_screenshot FROM report_schedule`, check that it's true for the alert and false for the report.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

modals are too tall, or too far from the top, to show the action buttons at the bottom of the modal. This pins the modal to the top of the viewport, and makes the modal max out at the viewport height. Using flexbox, the modal header/footer take the space they need, and the modal body will scroll if needed.\r\n\r\nThe native filters configuration modal had an `+ add` button that would scroll offscreen because of this change. This PR also addresses that by making it sticky at the bottom. There may be other little modal layout oddities... I'll try to take a QA sweep before calling this one ready to merge.\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the `generator-superset` Yeoman generator template generates plugins that require the old `superset-ui` monorepo. This is a first-pass at fixing the generator by changing the following:\r\n- Makes the plugin standalone by adding scripts for building the package, along with necessary babel and typescript configs\r\n- Removes the option to create a `superset-ui` package - now the generator only supports creating plugins\r\n- Remove the option to create class based components - now only functional components are provided out of the box\r\n- Removes the option to add badges to the README file\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOT\r\nThis plugin has been generated with the updated template:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/146784078-79937045-3a5d-4dfc-95fc-46f05cb1d382.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Go into the `superset-frontend/packages/generator-superset` folder and run `npm i`\r\n2. Go into `~/src` and run `mkdir superset-plugin-chart-hello-world`\r\n3. Run `yo @superset-ui/superset` and answer all questions\r\n4. Run `npm i --force && npm run build && npm run test && npm pack` and see that the new package works and can be packaged for npm\r\n5. Add the plugin to the Superset `MainPreset.js` and see it work\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\nTo extend `superset_config.py`, the Superset Helm chart currently allows users to [add code](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/helm/superset/values.yaml#L113) under `configOverrides` in `values.yaml`. However, it would be better if this code was in a separate `.py` file in the chart directory. This PR enables that through a similar setup. \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCreate a `test.py` in `helm/superset` and add `test: test.py` as an entry under `configOverridesFiles`. Install with\r\n```\r\nhelm install superset helm/superset\r\n```\r\nAfter installing,\r\n```\r\nk get secret/superset-config -o json | jq '.data.\"superset_config.py\"' -r | base64

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nUpdated the progress bar to use the spinner in fetching state when progress is 100. Whenever the users lands in a fetching with a large amount of data it causes a bad user experience since it takes a while for the data to render. With the spinner we provide a better experience and provides UI consistency in our loading states.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1215\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-12-16 at 2 24 29 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27827808/147888909-b00137e7-7c17-4adf-a5c0-b3c5085365fb.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nA dependency of the `node-sass` package (`node-gyp`) was so old it was crashing `npm i`, thus blocking the docs CI workflow. This PR bumps the `node-sass` version to a fairly recent one, along with `gatsby-plugin-sass` which also needed to be bumped. Also bumps the lock file to version 2.\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOT\r\nTo ensure the new build works, running `npm run start` starts the local server properly:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/146549253-f68ec4d2-0b4a-458d-9431-6cac4ef0bc77.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nrun the following in your

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently, numbers and currencies are formatted using the en Locale, i.e. with group separator `,` and decimal separator `.`\r\n\r\nThere have been a couple of issues reports raising the need to customize superset and proposing ways to do so (e.g. #https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/3972 and https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/8913).\r\n\r\nThis (draft) PR suggests to apply the currently active Locale to do number Formatting (though this might not be the best solution, I'm open for feedback...)\r\n\r\n### Open questions\r\nWhile implementing this proposal, I had a number of questions:\r\n1. Should number formats really change when changing the Locale, as just changing the unit without doing currency conversion is plain false (For currencies, adding a special Formatter as proposed in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63319902/customise-the-number-format-in-apache-superset/63385549#63385549 might be the better way to do so...)\r\n2. Should superset copy D3's locale defintions or just retrieve them from CDN (Note that a Locale conversion from superset to D3 would be necessary, as highlighted by @craigappl [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/3972#issuecomment-447307711)\r\n3. There are a couple of other places where numbers are formatted, which are not addressed by this PR (e.g. table chart)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n<img

\"Deutsch\"}, to the list of LANGUAGES in superset_config.py\r\n2. start superset an switch to German (Deutsch)\r\n3. display some charts and see ther number format changed.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR improves the existing color consistency.

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nRecent changes to dashboard updates caused incorrect partial updates to be committed, resulting in malformed json in some db engines (mysql) and breaking dashboards that contained non ascii characters in headers or custom chart titles. This PR ensures that we only commit when all updates are complete.\r\n\r\nThis issue emerged in #17570. I verified that #17766 seemed to fix the problem in a test env, but it turns out this problem is likely db specific, so it did not actually address the root cause.\r\n\r\nThe root cause:\r\n* `DashboardDAO.update` updates all properties naively, including `json_metadata`, which includes `positions`\r\n* `DashboardDAO.update_charts_owners` _commits the changes done in `DashboardDAO.update`_. Something goes wrong when committing a string with emojis, resulting in a truncated `dashboard.json_metadata` for mysql.\r\n* `DashboardDAO.set_dash_metadata` fetches `dashboard.params_dict`, which fails to parse due to malformed json. Error is thrown.\r\n\r\nOther locations where we save json with emojis inadvertently use `json.dumps(json.loads(...))` to encode the emojis in a mysql-friendly way, so we didn't see this before.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nVerified change locally with mysql db.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n@geido @kgabryje @graceguo-supercat @etr2460

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently loading a dashboard with the `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTER_SETS` feature flag enabled triggers a 404 to the `filtersets` dashboard endpoint. This is most likely due to a race condition which is caused by the dashboard state not being available in Redux yet when the filter set request is dispatched. This adds the dashboard id to the `getFilterSets` action to ensure that the caller already has the id available.\r\n\r\n# AFTER\r\nAfter the change the filter set request results in a 200 with the correct dashboard id:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/146336982-a62a0152-6506-49e1-9ec0-fe565e117fce.png)\r\n\r\n# BEFORE\r\nBefore the change, loading a dashboard always triggers a 404 to the filter set endpoint:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/146337083-98c271c0-ce71-4462-930c-9d427efe9366.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen importing a dataset/chart/dashboard/saved query referencing databases that already exist, we shouldn't prompt for the password again.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore, every time we import something that depends on a database with a password we would prompt the user for it.\r\n\r\nAfter, we no longer prompt for the password.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Create a DB connection that has a password.\r\n2. Create a dataset and then a chart; export chart.\r\n3. Delete the chart and import it. It will import without prompting for the password.\r\n4. Delete everything and import the chart. It will prompt for the password before importing.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThere was a bug report about saved queries not persisting if you refresh the browser that they are on. This PR adds a saved_query foreign key to tab state and then uses that to populate the remoteId necessary for the proper buttons to appear in sql lab. \r\n\r\nIt does this by creating a new action linked to saving a query that adds the id into the backend, which then gets referenced in `getInitialState` as well as the action for switching tabs. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48933336/148290008-8e7695e0-a964-49a7-a0a4-1d2bcc914d73.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThe Pivot Table v2 chart is based on a forked and heavily modified library react-pivottable.\r\nThe fork is available here: https://github.com/apache-superset/react-pivottable\r\n\r\nSince the monorepo project is finished and we've migrated our viz plugins to the main repo, it's a good time to do the same to react-pivottable fork.\r\nCurrently very few people are aware of existence of that repo and even fewer contribute to it (to be precise, only I do). Moving that repo to the main codebase would make it easier for community contributors to work on improving and maintaining the Pivot Table chart.\r\nI'm not concerned about keeping our version of react-pivottable in sync with the original - it hasn't been updated for over the year.\r\nAfter this PR is accepted and merged, https://github.com/apache-superset/react-pivottable will be archived.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nEverything should look and work the same as before\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR is a follow-up of PR #17570 in response to the issue that was brought in revert-PR #17753. \r\nThe changes in PR #17570 saved the `positions` in the `json_metadata` of a Dashboard even if that wasn't really necessary. It appears that very large dashboards might encounter an error as the `positions` might become too large AND/OR non-ascii characters might cause the json parsing to fail. \r\n\r\nThis PR forcefully removes the `positions` from the metadata, while making sure that all the related logics remain in place. It also introduces a temporary fix to make sure that Dashboards currently affected by this issue should ignore the `positions` in their metadata entirely. \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open a very large Dashboard\r\n2. Edit and Save the changes\r\n3. Make sure everything works as expected\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue
