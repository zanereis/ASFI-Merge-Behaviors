for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI firstly added more unit tests for the `BITMAT_BIT_POSITION` and `BITMAP_BUCKET_NUMBER` expressions. Secondly, I made a minor improvement in the implementation of the `BITMAP_CONSTRUCT_AGG` and `BUTMAP_OR_AGG` expressions, where I converted `inputAggBufferAttributes` from a method to a value.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe unit tests cover more corner cases. Having `inputAggBufferAttributes` as a value makes it so that the AttributeReferences aren't reinitialized every time `inputAggBufferAttributes` is referred to.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI reran all the tests for Bitmap expressions and they succeeded. The test suites were `BitmapExpressionUtilsSuite` and

PR is based on https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42022 to fix tests, as the PR author is on vacation.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new trait `CTEInChildren` and mix it to some commands that should have `WithCTE` on top of their children (queries) instead of main query. Also I modified  the `CTESubstitution` rule and removed special handling of `Command`s and similar nodes. After the changes, `Command`, `ParsedStatement` and `InsertIntoDir` are handled in the same way as other queries by referring to CTE Defs. Only the difference is in `WithCTE` is not not placed on the top of main query but on top of command queries.\r\n\r\nCloses #41922\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve code maintenance.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds backticks to any identifiers with special characters for `SHOW CREATE TABLE`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout proper backticks to quote the identifiers, if users copy paste the results from running `SHOW CREATE TABLE`,  they will hit analysis exception.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. The identifiers from the result of `SHOW CREATE TABLE` will be quoted if necessary (having special characters).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UT.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe main change of this pr as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Move `test` function from `RemoteSparkSession` to `ConnectFunSuite` due to `ConnectFunSuite` is a more basic trait\r\n2. Add a new `val runtTestCondition` with default value true to `ConnectFunSuite`, the `test` function will skip all test cases in a TestSuite when `runtTestCondition` is false, the subclas can override `runtTestCondition` when  there are execution conditions for the test suite. \r\n3. Overrdie `runtTestCondition` in `RemoteSparkSession` to skip all `RemoteSparkSession-based` tests for Java 21 to maintain test behavior of SPARK-44259\r\n4. Overrdie `runtTestCondition` in `ArrowEncoderSuite` to skip all tests for Java 21 due to it ss also Arrow-based test and can't run with Java 21 now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIgnore Arrow-based test to make Java 21 daily test pass.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/5550318355/jobs/10135311510\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] ArrowEncoderSuite:\r\n[info] -

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTop-k filters on a dense_rank() window function return wrong results, due to a bug in optimization InferWindowGroupLimit, specifically in the code for DenseRankLimitIterator, introduced in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-37099.\r\n\r\nThe bug is in DenseRankLimitIterator, it fails to reset state properly when transitioning from one window partition to the next. reset only resets rank = 0, what it is missing is to reset currentRankRow = null. This means that when processing the second and later window partitions, the rank incorrectly gets incremented based on comparing the ordering of the last row of the previous partition to the first row of the new partition.\r\n\r\nThis means that a dense_rank window func that has more than one window partition and more than one row with dense_rank = 1 in the second or later partitions can give wrong results when optimized.\r\n\r\nRankLimitIterator narrowly avoids this bug by happenstance, the first row in the new partition will try to increment rank, but increment it by the value of count which is 0, so it happens to work by accident. This PR also fixes the reset function in RankLimitIterator to make it more robust.\r\n\r\nExample repro:\r\n```\r\ncreate or replace temp view t1 (p, o) as values (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2);\r\n\r\nselect * from (select *, dense_rank() over (partition by p order by o) as rnk from t1) where rnk = 1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpark result:\r\n```\r\n[1,1,1]\r\n[1,1,1]\r\n[2,1,1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nCorrect result:\r\n```\r\n[1,1,1]\r\n[1,1,1]\r\n[2,1,1]\r\n[2,1,1]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix wrong results bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, fixes wrong results.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd sql tests and unit tests.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the previous tests for the optimization only had a single row per rank, so did not catch the bug as the bug requires multiple rows per rank. This PR strengthens the tests with data that contains multiple rows per rank.\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-16T22:49:48Z","updated_at":"2023-07-19T01:13:04Z","closed_at":"2023-07-19T01:13:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d0bd95fe4e25aa5b1f2779a9304232cacf6a8ebc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42026/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42026/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42026/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b9a0164bc6756f21358e734ff64e0b2211b91e38","head":{"label":"jchen5:dense-rank-limit","ref":"dense-rank-limit","sha":"b9a0164bc6756f21358e734ff64e0b2211b91e38","user":{"login":"jchen5","id":790409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDQwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/790409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5","html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":558995069,"node_id":"R_kgDOIVGWfQ","name":"spark","full_name":"jchen5/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jchen5","id":790409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDQwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/790409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5","html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new trait `CTEInChildren` and mix it to some commands that should have `WithCTE` on top of their children (queries) instead of main query. Also I modified  the `CTESubstitution` rule and removed special handling of `Command`s and similar nodes. After the changes, `Command`, `ParsedStatement` and `InsertIntoDir` are handled in the same way as other queries by referring to CTE Defs. Only the difference is in `WithCTE` is not not placed on the top of main query but on top of command queries.\r\n\r\nCloses #41922\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve code maintenance. Right now the CTE resolution code path is diverged: query with commands go into CTE inline code path where non-command queries go into CTEDef code path. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *InsertSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2023-07-16T12:55:39Z","updated_at":"2023-08-02T06:57:10Z","closed_at":"2023-08-02T06:57:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"50da417accd7a52a0a37d065d86af1c02ef3295d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42022/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42022/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42022/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/58bc2612bc768b7e36c45153dcb9709dc4206d71","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:cte-command-2","ref":"cte-command-2","sha":"58bc2612bc768b7e36c45153dcb9709dc4206d71","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes listListener that's being implemented in a previous [PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41752) that sends listener class payload to client. We will only send ids as references of listener classes to client side instead.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe should only return what users added previously in `listListeners` API. Only sending ids would be much more light-weighted.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tested.\r\nAlso performed manual integration test\r\n```\r\n@ import scala.collection.mutable\r\nimport

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nMaintenance tasks on StateStore was being done by a single background thread, which is prone to straggling. In this change, the single background thread would instead schedule maintenance tasks to a thread pool.\r\nIntroduced  `spark.sql.streaming.stateStore.numStateStoreMaintenanceThreads` config so the thread pool size is configurable.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nUsing a thread pool instead of a single thread for snapshotting and cleanup reduces the effect of stragglers in the background task.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nManual testing, wrote a stateful query, tracked how many maintenance tasks were done and compared this to the baseline.  In the devbox environment, this change performs slightly better. `StateStoreSuite` is enough to test functional correctness and cleanup here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark Connect only allows to cancel all operations in a session by using SparkSession.interruptAll().\r\nIn this PR we are adding a mechanism to interrupt by tag (similar to SparkContext.cancelJobsWithTag), and to interrupt individual operations.\r\n\r\nAlso, add the new tags to SparkListenerConnectOperationStarted.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBetter control of query cancelation in Spark Connect\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. New Apis in Spark Connect scala client:\r\n```\r\nSparkSession.addTag\r\nSparkSession.removeTag\r\nSparkSession.getTags\r\nSparkSession.clearTags\r\nSparkSession.interruptTag\r\nSparkSession.interruptOperation\r\n```\r\nand also `SparkResult.operationId`, to be able to get the id for `SparkSession.interruptOperation`.\r\n\r\nPython client APIs will be added in a followup PR.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`null IN (empty list)` incorrectly evaluates to null, when it should evaluate to false. (The reason it should be false is because a IN (b1, b2) is defined as a = b1 OR a = b2, and an empty IN list is treated as an empty OR which is false. This is specified by ANSI SQL.)\r\n\r\nMany places in Spark execution (In, InSet, InSubquery) and optimization (OptimizeIn, NullPropagation) implemented this wrong behavior. This is a longstanding correctness issue which has existed since null support for IN expressions was first added to Spark.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the optimization rules OptimizeIn and NullPropagation, which followed the preexisting, incorrect execution behavior. The execution fixes will be in the next PR.\r\n\r\nThe behavior is under a flag, which will be available to revert to the legacy behavior if needed. This flag is set to disable the new behavior until all of the fix PRs are complete.\r\n\r\nSee [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k8AY8oyT-GI04SnP7eXttPDnDj-Ek-c3luF2zL6DPNU/edit) for more information.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix wrong SQL semantics\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNot yet, but will fix wrong SQL semantics when enabled\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd unit tests and sql tests.","created_at":"2023-07-14T16:33:06Z","updated_at":"2023-07-20T03:10:02Z","closed_at":"2023-07-20T03:10:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7c3645c13a22bc1d8003897cf257cf70c08fcf79","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42007/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42007/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42007/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/23636378da87c0ee89909299a6f26731e530d64c","head":{"label":"jchen5:null-in-empty-opt","ref":"null-in-empty-opt","sha":"23636378da87c0ee89909299a6f26731e530d64c","user":{"login":"jchen5","id":790409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDQwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/790409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5","html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":558995069,"node_id":"R_kgDOIVGWfQ","name":"spark","full_name":"jchen5/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jchen5","id":790409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDQwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/790409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5","html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the filter condition from `col(\"c\") === 0` to `!col(\"c\")` in `MsSqlServerIntegrationSuite` to avoid `AnalysisException` when ANSI is enabled by default. The root cause is that `AnsiTypeCoercion` does not contain [`BooleanEquality`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/618b52097c07105d734aaf9b2a22b372920b3f31/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/TypeCoercion.scala#L842).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMake `MsSqlServerIntegrationSuite` robust in ANSI mode. This test has nothing to do with whether ANSI is enabled or not.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nN/A.","created_at":"2023-07-14T15:44:28Z","updated_at":"2023-07-17T04:11:13Z","closed_at":"2023-07-17T03:05:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e7f54e767cd52ed5ef75a2c261eb1c3f9b6db274","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42006/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42006/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42006/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fb0f61a2f2d9882d1715e27a6ec323fd319d8c8a","head":{"label":"wangyum:SPARK-44429","ref":"SPARK-44429","sha":"fb0f61a2f2d9882d1715e27a6ec323fd319d8c8a","user":{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":467759455,"node_id":"R_kgDOG-FxXw","name":"spark","full_name":"wangyum/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe input/output Attribute is preferred for validation using the `__CHAR_VARCHAR_TYPE_STRING` type specified in its Metadata.\r\nIf not specified, use the Attribute datatype again.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIf the input/output Attribute specifies a `__CHAR_VARCHAR_TYPE_STRING` tag in its Metadata, then the type specified by `__CHAR_VARCHAR_TYPE_STRING` should be used for validation.\r\nOtherwise, use the Attribute DataType for verification  to avoid the following

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImprove the code comments:\r\n1. Rate micro-batch data source Scaladoc parameters aren't consistent with the options really supported by this data source.\r\n2. The `getCurrentWatermarkMs` has a special semantic for the 1st micro-batch when the watermark is not set yet. IMO, it should return `Option[Long]`, hence `None` instead of `0` for the first micro-batch, but since it's a breaking change, I preferred to add a note on that instead.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. Avoid confusion while using the classes and methods.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe tests weren't added because the change is only at the Scaladoc level.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`SparkSession.sql` in Connect actually only return a unresolved plan, however it may reference temp view, it should hold the analyzed plan in the server side in this case, since the temp view maybe dropped somewhere.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nit is a common pattern:\r\n\r\n1. create temp views;\r\n2. reference temp views in `SparkSession.sql` and get a result dataframe;\r\n3. drop temp views;\r\n4. return the dataframe;\r\n\r\n\r\nfor example:\r\n1, in sql_formatter:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to check the number of argument types in the `InvokeLike` expressions. If the input types are provided, the number of types should be exactly the same as the number of argument expressions.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41954.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. This PR checks the contract described in the comment explicitly:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d9248e83bbb3af49333608bebe7149b1aaeca738/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/objects/objects.scala#L247 \r\n\r\nthat can prevent the errors of expression implementations, and improve code maintainability.\r\n\r\n2. Also it fixes the issue in the `UrlEncode` and `UrlDecode`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the related tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *UrlFunctionsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DataSourceV2FunctionSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk <max.gekk@gmail.com>\r\n(cherry picked

will become a keyword in Scala 3.\r\n[warn]   @BeanProperty var enum: java.time.Month = _\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo this pr add a new Scala checkstyle rule prohibit using `enum` as a variable or function name,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn `injectBloomFilter`, filter creation side size threshold judgment prun column.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRegarding whether to trigger `injectBloomFilter`, it should be consistent with `injectInSubqueryFilter` and not affected by columns other than `filterCreationSideExp`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What Was Changed\r\nWe enable for a custom function pointer to be passed around the private functions that allow for distributed training of a function. \r\n\r\n### Why Do We Need This Change\r\n\r\nBy abstracting the \"run_training_on_pytorch_file\" function to something that can be passed in, it allows for much easier creation of distributors that run on top of torch.distributed. Specifically, it makes it easy to implement distributed training of picklable functions in DeepspeedTorchDistributor. As mentioned, if there are accelerators that come out in the future built on top of torch.distributed, it will be very easy to support them in Spark. One can simply do the following:\r\n1. Inherit from TorchDistributor and define a _run_training_on_pytorch_file function or equivalent for your class\r\n2.  When defining run(...), simply return _run() and pass in your custom _run_training_on_pytorch_file function in as the respective argument\r\n\r\n### Any User-Facing Changes?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How Is This Tested?\r\n\r\nThe existing tests for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImport SparkSession in Python UDF only when useArrow is None. \r\n\r\nWhen useArrow is None, SparkSession is used to check the value of the Spark Conf \"spark.sql.execution.pythonUDF.arrow.enabled\".\r\n\r\nDelaying the import only when useArrow is None enables users to define a Python UDF without a SparkSession when (useArrow is not None).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBetter usability.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual

implements Scala foreachBatch(). The implementation basic and needs some more enhancements. The server side will be shared by Python implementation as well.\r\n\r\nOne notable hack in this PR is that it runs user's `foreachBatch()` with regular(legacy) DataFrame, rather than setting up remote Spark connect session and connect DataFrame. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAdds foreachBatch() support in Scala Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Adds foreachBatch() API\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- A simple unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the parsing of table function arguments to require parentheses around identifier after the TABLE keyword. Instead of `TABLE t`, the syntax should look like `TABLE(t)` instead as specified in the SQL standard.\r\n\r\n* I kept the previous syntax without the parentheses as an optional case in the SQL grammar so that we can catch it in the `AstBuilder` and throw an informative error message telling the user to add parentheses and try the query again.\r\n\r\n* I had to swap the order of parsing table function arguments, so the `table(identifier)` syntax does not accidentally parse as a scalar function call:\r\n  \r\n```\r\nfunctionTableArgument\r\n    : functionTableReferenceArgument\r\n    | functionArgument\r\n    ;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis syntax is written down in the SQL standard. Per the standard, `TABLE identifier` should actually be passed as `TABLE(identifier)`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, SQL syntax changes slightly.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds and updates unit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a new Spark UI page to display session and execution information for Spark Connect. This builds of the work in SPARK-43923 (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41443) that adds the relevant SparkListenerEvents and mirrors the ThriftServerPage in the Spark UI for JDBC/ODBC.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1709\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-27 at 11 29 22 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/65624911/934b7c69-3b44-460b-8fbb-36a9eb3f0798\">\r\n\r\n<img

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR modifies the arguments of the `ScalarUserDefinedFunction` case class to take in `serializedUdfPacket`, `inputTypes` and `outputType` instead of calculating these types internally from `function`, `inputEncoders` and `outputEncoder`. This allows the class to copy over the serialized udf value from the parent instance instead of re-creating it. Through this, we avoid hitting a variant of the issue mentioned in [SPARK-43198](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43198) which seems to cause protobuf cast for instances that are made through a copy operation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBugfix. Consider the following code:\r\n```\r\nclass A(x: Int) { def get = x * 7 }\r\nval myUdf = udf((x: Int) => new A(x).get)\r\nval modifiedUdf = myUdf.withName(\"myUdf\").asNondeterministic()\r\nspark.range(5).select(modifiedUdf(col(\"id\"))).as[Int].collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecuting this code currently results in hitting the following error:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.spark.connect.proto.ScalarScalaUDF cannot be cast to com.google.protobuf.MessageLite\r\n    at com.google.protobuf.GeneratedMessageLite$SerializedForm.readResolve(GeneratedMessageLite.java:1462)\r\n    at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\r\n    at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)\r\n    at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\r\n    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498)\r\n    at java.io.ObjectStreamClass.invokeReadResolve(ObjectStreamClass.java:1274)\r\n    at java.io.ObjectInputStream.readOrdinaryObject(ObjectInputStream.java:2196)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nIf we do not include the `myUdf.withName(\"myUdf\").asNondeterministic()`, the UDF runs as expected.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, fixes the bug mentioned above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a new E2E test in `ReplE2ESuite`.","created_at":"2023-07-12T15:28:46Z","updated_at":"2023-07-13T09:55:28Z","closed_at":"2023-07-13T09:55:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e7346ae5e2c2aad01d135a3ed2a2ab8955944482","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41959/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41959/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41959/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cf855350751991cf5344a5dc1deb96987c802520","head":{"label":"vicennial:SPARK-44388","ref":"SPARK-44388","sha":"cf855350751991cf5344a5dc1deb96987c802520","user":{"login":"vicennial","id":21010250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDEwMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21010250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial","html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":402021456,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDIwMjE0NTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"vicennial/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vicennial","id":21010250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDEwMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21010250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial","html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to check the number of argument types in the `InvokeLike` expressions. If the input types are provided, the number of types should be exactly the same as the number of argument expressions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. This PR checks the contract described in the comment explicitly:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d9248e83bbb3af49333608bebe7149b1aaeca738/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/objects/objects.scala#L247 \r\n\r\nthat can prevent the errors of expression implementations, and improve code maintainability.\r\n\r\n2. Also it fixes the issue in the `UrlEncode` and `UrlDecode`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the related tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *UrlFunctionsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly
