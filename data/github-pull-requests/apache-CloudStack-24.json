Description\r\n\r\nThis change will set the sessionkey under the /client/api path. This commit should prevent duplicate sessionkey cookies from being set on both /client (incorrect) and /client/api (correct). Prior to this commit, the /client version was being set while the /client/api version remained unchanged with an invalid sessionkey. As a result, subsequent requests after the SAML2 authentication would immediately fail with an invalid session and results in the user being logged out. \r\n\r\nThe sessionkey is now set explicitly for the /client/api path which should fix this issue, regardless of the SSO URL and path that's being used.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed.

`uuidgen`)\r\nlocal.storage.uuid=a43943c1-1759-4073-9db1-bc0ea19203aa,f5b1220b-4446-42dc-a872-cffd281f9f8c\r\nlocal.storage.path=/var/lib/libvirt/images,/var/lib/libvirt/images2\r\n(4) restart

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR improves clarity to the user concerning the project list view component. The current behavior disables the project view menu when an Account does not have permission to list projects. However, that can be a bit confusing for users, if they have no permission to list projects, then, the expected behavior would be to hide the component that the user does not have access to (that is what happens with other components). Therefore, this PR aims to hide the project view when the user does not have the permission list projects.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/6060\r\nBash version 3 does not have support for associative arrays. Hence during the packaging phase the metadata.ini file created (on osx) isn't in proper format as the script used to generate it i.e., templateConfig.sh made use of associative arrays - which is supported from bash v4 onward. This eventually leads failure to deploy DB on OSX.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the script to work on systems using bash v3. \r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to refactor the Account class by changing both the account type and the account state to de facto enums to facilitate future ACS development. Moreover, the use of well-documented and clear enum classes is a good practice in Java, and as such, we should try to adopt such good practices to reduce our technical debt.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [X] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [X] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the SSVM scaling issue noticed on VMware.\r\nWhen active cmds i.e., no of entries in cmd_exec_log table is 0 and the SSVM standby capacity - `secstorage.capacity.standby` is higher than the max sessions an SSVM can handle `secstorage.session.max`, then the no of SSVMs get scaled up. However, when there aren't any active commands, a logic is added to scale down the SSVMs.\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/6038\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And

Description\r\n\r\nWhen building ACS, module `engine-schema` downloads the system VMs' checksums from https://download.cloudstack.org/systemvm/X/ through `templateConfig.sh` and puts them into `metadata.ini`. The method that gets the checksums only validates the hypervisor name, which works fine when we have only the major version; however, when we also have minor versions, it ends up adding all checksums of a hypervisor into `metadata.ini`:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nlab@management:~$ cat /usr/share/cloudstack-management/templates/systemvm/metadata.ini\r\n\r\n[ovm3]\r\ntemplatename =

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses an issue when live scaling a VM with the KVM hypervisor. When the VM has the CPU cores or CPU speed increased, the cpu_shares (priority) of the VM is not updated accordingly. To overcome that, it was needed to manually restart the VM or using the command: `virsh schedinfo --domain <vm_internal_name> --live  cpu_shares=<cpu_shares_value>`. This PR changes this to automatically update the cpu_shares when the CPU cores or speed is increased. It is worth mention that the current behavior caused steal time when VMs would compete for the CPU after a dynamic scale process.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n- Host\r\n    - 6 vCPUs X 2.39Ghz\r\n    - 16GB RAM\r\n\r\n- Custom service offering\r\n    - 1 to 6 vCPUs\r\n    - 2.35Ghz\r\n\r\n- VM (deploy config)\r\n    - 1 vCPU\r\n    - 1024MB RAM\r\n\r\nThe cpu_shares of a VM is calculated as follow:\r\n`cpu_shares = number of vCPUs X vCPU frequency in Mhz`\r\n\r\nUsing the command `virsh schedinfo --domain <internal_vm_name>` the cpu_shares displayed was 2350, which is expected. However, when live scaling the VM to 4 vCPUs, which should return 9400 shares, it was the initial 2350 shares. If the VM is restarted, however, the 9400 shares is used, as it should without the need to restart the VM.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nUsing the same configuration and steps I used to describe the bug. Then, when live scaling a VM, it returns the correct cpu_shares without the need to restart it. Therefore, when the VM with the 2350 shares is live scaled to 4 vCPUs, the cpu_shares when using the command mentioned above, returned the correct value of 9400.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I created unit tests for the affected

Description\r\n\r\nWhen an NFS primary storage pool is created, Libvirt mounts the pool with the default NFS configurations (that can be customized by ADMINS via `/etc/nfsmount.conf`)\r\n\r\nThis would be a typical mounted NFS pool:\r\n```\r\n~# mount -v | grep <pool_path>\r\n<pool_addr>:/<pool_path> on /mnt/a58cd909-77b7-3c48-b355-f9aeddf1a215 type nfs4 (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,vers=4.2,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,clientaddr=<clientAddress>,local_lock=none,addr=<pool_addr>)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, in case the pool is umounted (for whatever reason) `kvmheartbeat.sh` remounts with `timeo=133` and `retrans=10`:\r\n```\r\n~# mount -v | grep <pool_path>\r\n<pool_addr>:/<pool_path> on /mnt/a58cd909-77b7-3c48-b355-f9aeddf1a215 type nfs4 (rw,relatime,sync,vers=4.2,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,namlen=255,acregmin=0,acregmax=0,acdirmin=0,acdirmax=0,soft,noac,proto=tcp,timeo=133,retrans=10,sec=sys,clientaddr=<clientAddress>,local_lock=none,a\r\nddr=<pool_addr>)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR aims at removing the hard-coded values to make sure that `kvmheartbeat.sh` \"re-mounts\" the partitions accordingly to the expected parameters.\r\n\r\nNote that if one wants to have a different timeout than the default of 600, it would be possible to achieve it by setting config: `/etc/nfsmount.conf `\r\n```\r\n[ NFSMount_Global_Options ]\r\ntimeo=1800\r\n```\r\nWith this PR, then it would work fine either with the Libvirt mount and `kvmheartbeat.sh` \"re-mount\".\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to
