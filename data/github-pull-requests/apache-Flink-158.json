you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd liunx aarch64 support for tpcds e2e test\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nFetch the dsdgen linux aarch64 binary if the platform is aarch64 when running tpcds e2e test\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tpcds e2e tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

LegacyTypeInformationType<>(\r\n    LogicalTypeRoot.TIMESTAMP_WITHOUT_TIME_ZONE,\r\n    SqlTimeTypeInfo.TIMESTAMP))\r\n,\r\nnew AtomicDataType(\r\n  new LegacyTypeInformationType<>(\r\n    LogicalTypeRoot.TIMESTAMP_WITHOUT_TIME_ZONE,\r\n    new LegacyTimestampTypeInfo(7)))\r\n```\r\nIn such situations, we should return proper converters.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Let DataFormatConverters support any TIMESTAMP_WITHOUT_TIME_ZONE types\r\n- Add tests to verify\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nEnable to control memory usage of RocksDB via Cache and WriteBufferManager.\r\nWe would lazy initialize a `LRUCache` and `WriteBufferManager` (which cost memory from the cache) when first keyed state backend created, and share these objects among other RocksDB instances per slot. By doing this, we could limit the memory usage of block cache and write buffers.\r\nWe would also set flag `setCacheIndexAndFilterBlocks` as true to limit the memory usage of index&filter. Moreover, we would also set flags `setCacheIndexAndFilterBlocksWithHighPriority` and `setPinL0FilterAndIndexBlocksInCache` as true to minimize the performance impact when we try to limit the total memory (please refer to [cache-index-filter-doc](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Block-Cache#caching-index-filter-and-compression-dictionary-blocks) for more details)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Introduce a deque of `stateBackendSharedObjects` within `MemoryManager`, which contains objects shared among RocksDB instances per slot.\r\n  - Introduce `state.backend.rocksdb.per-slot.total.memory`, `state.backend.rocksdb.write-buffer.ratio` and `state.backend.rocksdb.high-pri-pool.ratio` to `RocksDBOptions`.\r\n  - If total memory is limited, RocksDB would share cache and writebuffer manager to limit the total memory usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - Added a new `RocksDBStateBackendBoundedMemoryTest` to verify memory bounded for rocksDB state backend.\r\n  - Extended `RocksDBStateBackendConfigTest` to verify memory control related parameters.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **yes**, memory control would impact the performance of RocksDB\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? docs in

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe `com.esotericsoftware.kryo.Serializer` import in `DummyStreamExecutionEnvironment` fails the `test_table_shaded_dependencies.sh`. As discussed in the JIRA, it's safe to add it to the whilelist of `checkCodeDependencies()` method as it is from flink-core. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Exclude `com.esotericsoftware.kryo` in `checkCodeDependencies()`\r\n- Add note in `DummyStreamExecutionEnvironment` to remove the check back when removing `DummyStreamExecutionEnvironment`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the default implementations of the `close()` method in the `ClusterClient` and the `JobClient`. The reason is that having a default implementation may lead to subclass implementers not even thinking about providing a proper `close()` implementation, which can lead to difficult bugs related to resource leaks.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently we don't ship this config.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Add performance e2e test module and scripts which methoned in .FLINK-14918*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*This change adds performance e2e test module and scripts to run end-2-end performance test and collects metrics *\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*Manually verified that  can run correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)","created_at":"2019-12-04T02:16:54Z","updated_at":"2020-01-13T11:33:27Z","closed_at":"2020-01-13T11:33:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8a304d60ebcc662f8f9230b9336b384652578bf0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278805855,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4ODA1ODU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TestInfrastructure","name":"component=TestInfrastructure","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10409/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10409/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10409/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/4e6b07462d77b1c8b0dec6483efaf5d0e00e4ca6","head":{"label":"Li-Aihua:run_e2e","ref":"run_e2e","sha":"4e6b07462d77b1c8b0dec6483efaf5d0e00e4ca6","user":{"login":"Li-Aihua","id":57649518,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjQ5NTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57649518?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Li-Aihua","html_url":"https://github.com/Li-Aihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Li-Aihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Li-Aihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Li-Aihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Li-Aihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Li-Aihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Li-Aihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Li-Aihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Li-Aihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Li-Aihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":221111634,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjExMTE2MzQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"Li-Aihua/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Li-Aihua","id":57649518,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjQ5NTE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57649518?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Li-Aihua","html_url":"https://github.com/Li-Aihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Li-Aihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Li-Aihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Li-Aihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Li-Aihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Li-Aihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Li-Aihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Li-Aihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Li-Aihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Li-Aihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Li-Aihua/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd an interface `JobListener` that can be registered by users to get notification when specific job status changed.\r\n\r\ncc @kl0u @aljoscha @zjffdu \r\n\r\nHere is one design decision I have to point out and discuss with you. If we pass `JobClient` `onJobSubmitted`, it brings several extra overhead\r\n\r\n1. User should not call `JobClient#close` on the passed `JobClient` since it's handled by `execute` or the caller of `executeAsync`\r\n2. `executeAsync` should return after `onJobSubmitted` called; otherwise if user calls `execute` the passed `JobClient` possibly closed concurrently.\r\n3. User should never invoke blocking method in `onJobSubmitted` since it would block the return of `executeAsync`. However, if user calls `JobClient`'s methods in another thread, the job client again possibly gets closed by `execute`. See my comment below.\r\n\r\n@zjffdu if you're sure the user case is get `JobID` `onJobSubmitted`, we can simply the concurrent/execution model quite a lot.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nDedicate unit tests `JobListenerTest`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes, new user-facing API `JobListener` and its registering & removal methods in env)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWith [FLINK-13184](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-15036), we replaced the `NMClient` with the `NMClientAsync`. As part of this change, container start up errors are now handled by a callback to NMClientAsync.CallbackHandler. The implementation of `NMClientAsync.CallbackHandler#onStartContainerError` will be called by the `NMClientAsync`. Since the implementation does state changing operations, it needs to happen inside of the YarnResourceManager main thread.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Wrap all codes of `onStartContainerError` in `runAsync(() -> {xxxx})`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* The change could be covered by unit test `YarnResourceManagerTest#testOnStartContainerError`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-04T01:07:17Z","updated_at":"2019-12-05T01:36:16Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T21:14:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cb72277a6eaef0b2454939185d42e8ccfc3992be","assignee":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272992926,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkyOTI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/YARN","name":"component=Deployment/YARN","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10407/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10407/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10407/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/0de43b4a967488c35b95ff870d6a9ddcfac0108a","head":{"label":"wangyang0918:FLINK-15036","ref":"FLINK-15036","sha":"0de43b4a967488c35b95ff870d6a9ddcfac0108a","user":{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205999027,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU5OTkwMjc=","name":"flink","full_name":"wangyang0918/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUse the `LogicalType#asSerializableString` as the properties value string instead of using `TypeStringUtil`. This can keep the nullability and precision.\r\n\r\nNOTE: However, this will lead to the default conversion class of `TIMESTAMP` declared in DDL will be `LocalDateTime`. In the previous versions, the default conversion class is `java.sql.Timestamp`. We have to update all the connectors to adapt this changes, otherwise it will fail to create the connector. We should also add this into release note. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n82bae84e63e8e42447e75e097a32cc4f8d4f0618\r\n - Support to parse LegacyTypeInformationType, because user may pass in Types.BIG_DEC into TableSchema\r\n\r\n423400c30bcf6a2c0f97d439db1e25fd76f7e01c\r\n - Use LogicalType.asSerializableString as the data type properties value string\r\n\r\nf1f08640eca5f6980b51ecfecd318f36d3f6773e b3962df2b64140b0be9232449e93a213404e6ebb fb7f5e6fd44afb5c26c72ee579b4eb883b2dccfe d7ecec4f1d9e2857f461f82faee5a902224ccd0a e80446be9909bd9bcf1304aa0050c87c0bb37479 ab3e19f2ceea1cb1e60586b9781254609ab2b192\r\n - update connectors to adapt the properties changes, because the default TIMESTAMP conversion class is LocalDateTime now.\r\n\r\nac84bc121839537b858ed201c464d836f823c209\r\n - Use `data-type` as watermark expression type key too\r\n\r\n038052c833940fbaef3111ed92525216f13edee2\r\n - Support to pass nullability and precision defined in DDL to planner\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests and new added tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-03T14:33:38Z","updated_at":"2019-12-07T12:50:35Z","closed_at":"2019-12-07T12:16:40Z","merged_at":"2019-12-07T12:16:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"2ecf7cacbe742099d78c528de962fccf13c14629","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10403/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10403/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10403/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/528bb017bb79c2b2fdd126caf673678015c2bb49","head":{"label":"wuchong:schema-properties","ref":"schema-properties","sha":"528bb017bb79c2b2fdd126caf673678015c2bb49","user":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63797485,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Mzc5NzQ4NQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"wuchong/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport read/write timestamp in Hive\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Map timestamp type in Hive to `DataTypes.TIMESTAMP(9)`. Since Hive doesn't support timestamp precision, only timestamps of precision 9 is supported by HiveCatalog at the moment.\r\n  - Add shim method to convert timestamp instances between Hive and Flink.\r\n  - New test case for read/write timestamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNew test case.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? docs\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-03T13:04:37Z","updated_at":"2019-12-08T08:33:14Z","closed_at":"2019-12-08T07:05:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8032b005528ea9399ac1af515ce657cd1caf1c7c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10401/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10401/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10401/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/b3aaab0b14a7839f70f73e619e582deeb9225d89","head":{"label":"lirui-apache:FLINK-15020","ref":"FLINK-15020","sha":"b3aaab0b14a7839f70f73e619e582deeb9225d89","user":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65453317,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTQ1MzMxNw==","name":"flink","full_name":"lirui-apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nA `MemoryManager#computeMemorySize(double fraction)` is needed to calculate managed memory bytes from a fraction.\r\nIt can be helpful for operators to get the memory size it can reserve and for further #reserveMemory. (Similar to `#computeNumberOfPages`).\r\n\r\nHere are two cases that may need this method in near future:\r\n1. Python operator memory management\r\n2. Statebackend memory management\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Added MemoryManager#computeMemorySize*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - *Added unit tests for MemoryManager#computeMemorySize*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\nCurrently, BoundedBlockingSubpartition relies on the add of next BufferConsumer to flush and recycle the previous one, which means at least (numSubpartition + 1) buffers is needed to make the bounded blocking ResultPartition work. However, ResultPartitionFactory gives only (numSubpartition) required buffers to BufferPool of bounded blocking ResultPartition which may lead to deadlock problem. This PR tries to fix the problem by increasing the number of required buffers by 1.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - The number of required buffers of the BufferPool of ResultPartition is increased by one to (numSubpartition + 1).\r\n  - A new test case is added to verify the change.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nA new test case ResultPartitionTest#testWriteToBlockingResultPartitionWithMinimumBuffers is added.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUpdate string \"chk-\" to constant\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd a new `executeAsync()` method which returns a future of `JobClient`. This exposes the new executor/job client work on the user API.\r\n\r\nI added such methods in `ExecutionEnvironment` & `StreamExecutionEnvironment` and export as Scala API.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't patch code for make it works in every environment that hijacks `execution` method. The reason is that 1) future work will port (Local|Remote)Environment under new Executor abstraction so then they will work. 2) CollectionEnvironment doesn't support something like `JobClient`. Actually I think such environment can be replaced with LocalEnvironment.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I do only check not null for `ExecutorFactory` in `executeAsync` and throw an exception with description when we cannot find one, i.e., Local, Remote, Collection Environment. It will hints users that these envs don't support such feature(now).\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n`executeAsync()` is a lightweight interface for default parameter. And with this change all codepath previously goes into `execute(jobName)` now also goes into `executeAsync(jobName)`. Thus I think the change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes, we introduces more user APIs)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (JavaDocs, we can add document on site in the future)\r\n\r\ncc @aljoscha @kl0u

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*The blink planner will use default rowCount value (defined in FlinkPreparingTableBase#DEFAULT_ROWCOUNT) when the statistics is unknown, and maybe choose bad plan. It's better let planner choose a stable execution plan (such as using two-phase Aggregate rather than one-phase Aggregate to avoid data skew) if the statistics is unknown. HashJoin will be enhanced in the plan, and the pr will not involve HashJoin*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *add FlinkRelMdTableRealRowCountDetection to tell whether a RelNode has real row count*\r\n  - *Choose two-phase Aggregate when AggregatePhaseStrategy is AUTO and the row count is unknown*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added FlinkRelMdTableRealRowCountDetectionTest that validates the result on different RelNode*\r\n - *Extended AggregateTestBase validates the plan of aggregate with or without row count*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no)**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no)**\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

The fatal error notification added by this patch can restart JVM cleaning up the state letting job state machine make progress.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Catch fatal or OOM error from task cancellation initiation and notify fatal error to taskmanager.\r\n  - Added a unit test for cancelling task by mocking the fatal error.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Instead of catching fatal/OOM errors from each thread start, added a catch at a higher level by internalizing `cancelOrFailAndCancelInvokable`, as it would make sense to notify fatal error no matter where such error comes from during the function. In addition, doing so made unit testing easier by mocking.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - Added a unit test for fatal error on cancelling task.\r\n  - Manually verified that by using an app intentionally leaking threads, job state machine is not stuck by restarting taskmanager JVM where thread limit was hit and everything else was impacted by that. Without the patch, one or more tasks have cancellation completely stuck, leading to stuck job state machine.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  -

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nIn FLINK-11046, We know that ElasticSearch6Connector cause thread blocked when index failed with retry. In either case, elasticsearch rest-high-level-client's bug can deadlock when bulk requests fail.  this can still happen in  7.3.0+ .\r\nsee details：\r\n[BulkProcessor can deadlock when bulk requests fail](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/47599)\r\n[Prevent deadlock by using separate schedulers](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/48697)\r\n We should bump elasticsearch-rest-high-level-client to 7.5.0 in connectors \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-02T20:03:51Z","updated_at":"2020-01-08T12:13:45Z","closed_at":"2020-01-08T12:13:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6ae451840d48cc95ee029a4d4c08eda87067abed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273431901,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDMxOTAx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/ElasticSearch","name":"component=Connectors/ElasticSearch","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10385/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10385/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10385/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/10838338c780f67cdff86390e3caefccb09f9ad8","head":{"label":"suxinglee:FLINK-11046","ref":"FLINK-11046","sha":"10838338c780f67cdff86390e3caefccb09f9ad8","user":{"login":"suxinglee","id":9591097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTEwOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9591097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suxinglee","html_url":"https://github.com/suxinglee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suxinglee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suxinglee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suxinglee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suxinglee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suxinglee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suxinglee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suxinglee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suxinglee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suxinglee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"e62a04ae0eff3a7940e5f8eac3dae563ad2ddc6b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

 What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n Refactors the KeyedStateInputFormat to support arbitrary user function types. It now follows the model of Task -> Operator -> Function where the input format is the task, StateReaderOperator is the low-level operator that can be implemented for any function type. In the future this allows us to support reading other low-level encodings such as windows or stateful functions.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nCovered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n##

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImplement listPartitionsByFilter for HiveCatalog.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Call corresponding IMetaStoreClient API to get partition specs by filter.\r\n  - Add test cases\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNew test cases\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Add funcion to set up environment to run performance e2e tests which methoned in .FLINK-14920*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*This change added script to set up environment to run performance e2e tests*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*Manually verified that  can run correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Add performance e2e test suite for basic operations which methoned in .FLINK-14917*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*This change added test classes and test scenarios for end-to-end-perf*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running two test scenarios,   verifying that jobs can run correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis PR introduce data compression to shuffle which can reduce disk IO and network IO. The results of the tpc-ds benchmark show that for a single query, data compression can reduce at most 40% of the running time.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  -  Copies the block compression utils from flink-table module to flink-runtime module.\r\n  -  Implements a BufferCompressor and a BufferDecompressor which take in Buffer and return Buffer based on the compression utils copied from table module.\r\n  -  Adds a flag to Buffer to identify if it is compressed.\r\n  -  Each ResultPartition contains a BufferCompressor and each SingleInputGate contains a BufferDecompressor.\r\n  -  In BoundedBlockingSubpartition, when writing a buffer out, the buffer will be compressed (call BufferCompressor#compress) if the compression is enabled. \r\n  - When writing a buffer to disk, the compression flag is also written out and when reading the buffer back from disk, the compression flag will be set accordingly.\r\n  -  In PipelinedSubpartition, when polling buffer, the buffer will be compressed if compression is enabled and there's readable data to compress.\r\n  -  In SingleInputGate, if a received Buffer is compressed (identified by the compression flag), then it will be decompressed (by calling BufferDecompressor#decompress).\r\n  -  Adds a compression flag to BufferResponse to let the buffer receiver know if the received buffer is compressed.\r\n  -  Adds a ```boolean isLocal``` parameter to ```ResultSubpartitionView#getNextBuffer``` to identify if we are polling buffer from a local input channel to avoid compression for local channel.\r\n  \r\nNote: the buffer will remain uncompressed is the size of the data grows after compression.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nSeveral new test cases are added to verify the change, including ```BufferCompressionTest```, ```CreditBasedPartitionRequestClientHandlerTest#testReceiveCompressedBuffer```, ```PartitionRequestClientHandlerTest#testReceiveCompressedBuffer```, ```NettyMessageSerializationTest#testEncodeDecode``` compressed buffer, read/write compressed buffer in ```BoundedBlockingSubpartitionWriteReadTest```, ```PipelinedSubpartitionWithReadViewTest#testBufferCompression```, ```SingleInputGateTest#testGetCompressedBuffer```, ```ShuffleCompressionItCase```.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix an error URL in Table API & SQL page, as 'Connect to External Systems' linked to 'System (Built-in) Functions' \r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis adds a similar class as Calcite's `SqlOperandTypeInference` to Flink's type inference.\r\n\r\nFor FLIP-65, we will need to implement those interfaces as the planner needs infer the `DataType`s out of logical types that come from the logical query. This is also beneficial to support the NULL literal in the future.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Introduction of `InputTypeStrategy`\r\n- Update of the `TypeInferenceUtil`\r\n- Integration into `ResolveCallByArgumentsRule` (not used yet)\r\n- Implementation of built-in `InputTypeStrategies`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows: `InputTypeStrategiesTest`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nStreamTableEnvironment.connect throw exception when using \"FileSystem\" connector and \"CSV\" format. The PR fix this issue\r\n\t\r\n## Brief change log\r\nadd \"format.schema\" to the \"supportedProperties\" of \"CsvTableSourceFactoryBase\"\r\norg.apache.flink.table.descriptors.FormatDescriptorValidator\r\norg.apache.flink.table.sources.CsvTableSourceFactoryBase\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-29T15:18:58Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T15:10:39Z","closed_at":"2019-11-30T02:42:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4783b895b7720cea1236bc0ead9fb8376afb0723","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273335481,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzM1NDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/FileSystem","name":"component=Connectors/FileSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10365/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10365/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10365/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/a74d58d044607ca06ef2f76d8603ccb8107b6a78","head":{"label":"caidezhi:FLINK-14994","ref":"FLINK-14994","sha":"a74d58d044607ca06ef2f76d8603ccb8107b6a78","user":{"login":"caidezhi","id":13580821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTgwODIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13580821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi","html_url":"https://github.com/caidezhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205780699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU3ODA2OTk=","name":"flink","full_name":"caidezhi/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"caidezhi","id":13580821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTgwODIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13580821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi","html_url":"https://github.com/caidezhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/caidezhi/flink","description":"Apache

PR extends the `FrontMetricGroup` to pass more reporter-specific parameters (in this PR only the delimiter; the character filter comes next).\r\n\r\nThe `FrontMetricGroup` only purpose is to inject reporter-specific arguments in scope-related calls, so that neither reporters or groups themselves have to handle this.\r\n\r\nCurrently the front group only passes the reporter index which the `AbstractMetricGroup` then uses to query the MetricRegistry for the delimiter to use.\r\nThis is a fairly roundabout way of doing it since the MR already knows at the time of creation of the FMG what the delimiter will be.\r\nIt also unnecessarily couples the MR to the scope generation in the AMG.\r\n\r\nIn the future additional reporter-specific arguments can be added to the FrontMetricGroup (character filters in FLINK-14410, delimiters for logical scopes in FLINK-7957).","created_at":"2019-11-29T15:09:52Z","updated_at":"2020-01-02T14:45:59Z","closed_at":"2019-12-08T10:27:41Z","merged_at":"2019-12-08T10:27:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"7d375cca5e3f95402c00b9ab95f6b76421b5e683","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273342730,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzQyNzMw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Metrics","name":"component=Runtime/Metrics","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10364/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10364/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10364/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/72284c361a6ff957c3f8d831d49dc4c93ac8f282","head":{"label":"zentol:14993","ref":"14993","sha":"72284c361a6ff957c3f8d831d49dc4c93ac8f282","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20647396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0NzM5Ng==","name":"flink","full_name":"zentol/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zentol/flink","description":"Mirror

too indirect and not suitable for some tests; particularly when the partition tracker does _something_ but doesn't interact with the shuffle environment.\r\nThis came up when I added eager return statements to the tracker when the given collection was empty.\r\n\r\nSeveral tests in the `TaskExecutorPartitionLifecycleTest` have been removed completely as they test now irrelevant behavior; the TE doesn't care about the partition type as this is an implementation detail of the tracker. Now that we use a test implementation of the tracker this detail has become irrelevant.\r\nThe core structure of the remaining tests has been retained.\r\n\r\nThe new `TaskExecutorPartitionTrackerImplTest` is a new unit test thats interactions between the tracker and shuffle environment. Specifically it checks under what circumstances partitions are being tracked or released.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-29T13:23:42Z","updated_at":"2019-12-05T10:33:02Z","closed_at":"2019-12-05T10:31:32Z","merged_at":"2019-12-05T10:31:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"b8f3b39abe7213c7523add591e26d74113d2001b","assignee":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273164140,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY0MTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Tests","name":"component=Tests","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10361/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10361/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10361/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/b39ea96555ba032a9a5726a52304993d2cb69b97","head":{"label":"zentol:14795","ref":"14795","sha":"b39ea96555ba032a9a5726a52304993d2cb69b97","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20647396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0NzM5Ng==","name":"flink","full_name":"zentol/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Add performance e2e test suite for basic operations which methoned in .FLINK-14917*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*This change added test classes and test scenarios for end-to-end-perf*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running two test scenarios,   verifying that jobs can run correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a set of performance optimizations for String serialization and de-serialization. While running a set of state-heavy streaming jobs, we noticed that Flink spends quite a lot of CPU time (~30-40%) doing String encoding and decoding in two places: while transferring messages between the nodes, and while loading and writing objects into the state store.\r\n\r\nWe did a simple benchmark of String read/write operations compared to a default JDK's DataOutput.writeUTF ano noted a significant performance difference between Flink implementation and the JDK one.\r\n\r\nPerformance difference was 4x on decoding and 2x on encoding for 16 symbol ascii strings.\r\n```\r\n[info]\tBenchmark\t                      (length)\t(stringType)\tMode\tCnt\tScore\t    Error\tUnits\r\n[info]\tStringDeserializerBenchmark.deserializeDefault\t16\tascii\tavgt\t25\t251.321\t±\t3.251\tns/op\r\n[info]\tStringDeserializerBenchmark.deserializeJDK\t16\tascii\tavgt\t25\t77.147\t±\t1.661\tns/op\r\n\r\n[info]\tStringSerializerBenchmark.serializeDefault\t16\tascii\tavgt\t25\t95.782\t±\t0.261\tns/op\r\n[info]\tStringSerializerBenchmark.serializeJDK\t\t16\tascii\tavgt\t25\t50.786\t±\t1.677\tns/op\r\n```\r\nFor larger strings performance was degrading even more significant, 7x and 4x accordingly:\r\n```\r\n[info]\tBenchmark\t                      (length)\t(stringType)\tMode\tCnt\tScore\t    Error\tUnits\r\n[info]\tStringDeserializerBenchmark.deserializeDefault\t128\tascii\tavgt\t25\t1757.726\t±\t3.312\tns/op\r\n[info]\tStringDeserializerBenchmark.deserializeJDK\t128\tascii\tavgt\t25\t263.445\t±\t6.912\tns/op\r\n\r\n[info]\tStringSerializerBenchmark.serializeDefault\t128\tascii\tavgt\t25\t670.627\t±\t2.807\tns/op\r\n[info]\tStringSerializerBenchmark.serializeJDK\t\t128\tascii\tavgt\t25\t151.789\t±\t7.295\tns/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut JDK DataOutput.writeUTF cannot be directly used as a serializer replacement because of it being incompatible with the current Flink binary format for strings. Also it is not able to write strings longer than 32kb, as it uses 2-byte length encoding. \r\n\r\nBut if you compare the difference in implementation between these two algorithms, the main important difference is intermediate buffering in JDK, compared to a iterative approach in Flink. This buffering allows HotSpot to do two important optimizations: \r\n* be able to unroll the whole encoding/decoding loop\r\n* as there is no data dependencies between characters anymore, CPU can achieve much higher internal parallelism and spend less time being stalled.\r\n\r\nWe made a simple [POC](https://github.com/shuttie/flink-string-serializer) which alters the implementation of `StringValue.writeString` and `StringValue.readString` in a way to introduce additional buffering, which significantly improves both encoding and decoding throughput on almost all the workloads.\r\n\r\nThere is also a property-based validation test suite which ensures that old and new serialization code produce exactly the same byte sequences, and doing a round-trip from old to new, new to old, and new to new produce the same results. We ran this suite with random data for ~1h and found no differences.\r\n\r\n## Benchmark results\r\nFull raw benchmark results are located [here](https://github.com/shuttie/flink-string-serializer/blob/master/README.txt). We did a series of benchmarks of three string encoding/decoding impmentations:\r\n* Flink's current `StringValue.writeString` and `StringValue.readString`\r\n* `StringValue.writeString` and `StringValue.readString` implementations from this PR\r\n* baseline binary-incompatible implementation of `DataInput.readUTF` and `DataOutput.writeUTF`\r\n\r\nFor a workload generator we used these parameters:\r\n* string types: 7-bit us-ascii, russian symbols (which are usually encoded as a 14-bit varlen numbers), chinese symbols (which are usually within 21-bit varlen number range) \r\n* string lengths: 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 characters.\r\n\r\n### Ascii strings\r\n```\r\n[info]\tBenchmark\t                      (length)\t(stringType)\tMode\tCnt\tScore\t    Error\tUnits\r\n[info]\tStringDeserializerBenchmark.deserializeDefault\t1\tascii\tavgt\t25\t46.603\t±\t0.750\tns/op\r\n[info]\tStringDeserializerBenchmark.deserializeImproved\t1\tascii\tavgt\t25\t51.074\t±\t0.720\tns/op\r\n[info]\tStringDeserializerBenchmark.deserializeJDK\t1\tascii\tavgt\t25\t63.402\t±\t1.631\tns/op\r\n[info]\tStringSerializerBenchmark.serializeDefault\t1\tascii\tavgt\t25\t31.595\t±\t0.489\tns/op\r\n[info]\tStringSerializerBenchmark.serializeImproved\t1\tascii\tavgt\t25\t33.454\t±\t0.151\tns/op\r\n[info]\tStringSerializerBenchmark.serializeJDK\t\t1\tascii\tavgt\t25\t34.721\t±\t0.128\tns/op\r\n\r\n[info]\tStringDeserializerBenchmark.deserializeDefault\t16\tascii\tavgt\t25\t251.321\t±\t3.251\tns/op\r\n[info]\tStringDeserializerBenchmark.deserializeImproved\t16\tascii\tavgt\t25\t55.385\t±\t1.176\tns/op\r\n[info]\tStringDeserializerBenchmark.deserializeJDK\t16\tascii\tavgt\t25\t77.147\t±\t1.661\tns/op\r\n[info]\tStringSerializerBenchmark.serializeDefault\t16\tascii\tavgt\t25\t95.782\t±\t0.261\tns/op\r\n[info]\tStringSerializerBenchmark.serializeImproved\t16\tascii\tavgt\t25\t51.806\t±\t0.180\tns/op\r\n[info]\tStringSerializerBenchmark.serializeJDK\t\t16\tascii\tavgt\t25\t50.786\t±\t1.677\tns/op\r\n\r\n[info]\tStringDeserializerBenchmark.deserializeDefault\t128\tascii\tavgt\t25\t1757.726 ±\t3.312\tns/op\r\n[info]\tStringDeserializerBenchmark.deserializeImproved\t128\tascii\tavgt\t25\t140.374\t±\t1.006\tns/op\r\n[info]\tStringDeserializerBenchmark.deserializeJDK\t128\tascii\tavgt\t25\t263.445\t±\t6.912\tns/op\r\n[info]\tStringSerializerBenchmark.serializeDefault\t128\tascii\tavgt\t25\t670.627\t±\t2.807\tns/op\r\n[info]\tStringSerializerBenchmark.serializeImproved\t128\tascii\tavgt\t25\t161.481\t±\t2.798\tns/op\r\n[info]\tStringSerializerBenchmark.serializeJDK\t\t128\tascii\tavgt\t25\t151.789\t±\t7.295\tns/op\r\n```\r\nSo for ascii strings:\r\n* ~~on 1-char strings the new implementation is a bit slower than the old one~~.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Improve efficiency by bitwise operation.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *To improve performance, I replaced \" / \" with \" >> \", and replaced \" * \" with \" << \".*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code optimization without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\npropose a new functionality of KafkaTableSource which can consume multiple topics at the same time.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nDesign plan\r\n\r\n    Add a new constructor in KafkaTableSource which accepts topics with List type as one parameter.\r\nModify the existed one which only accepts one topic as string type to call the proposed one to finish the instantiation. That is to say, wrap this topic in a list and pass it to the multi-topics-consuming constructor.\r\nModify the overridden method createKafkaConsumer in KafkaTableSource to pass topics as List instead of String.\r\nReplace the field topic with topics as List type in  KafkaTableSourceBase and modify every place using topic with topics. So we just need to modify the constructor KafkaTableSourceBase, method getDataStream, and equals and hashCode.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nTest plan\r\n\r\n    There is less to do as KafkaTableSource is based on FlinkKafkaConsumer which already supports consuming multiple topics and is tested well. Of course, we can easily add further more tests if needed.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-29T03:12:18Z","updated_at":"2023-10-11T19:02:29Z","closed_at":"2023-10-11T19:02:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5a5362f425ae73f7451657a45f67871e90742e58","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273182709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgyNzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Kafka","name":"component=Connectors/Kafka","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10354/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10354/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10354/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/39f094776ea236e08b18c471c36fc784d8e85bbc","head":{"label":"fangpengcheng95:Flink-Connectors","ref":"Flink-Connectors","sha":"39f094776ea236e08b18c471c36fc784d8e85bbc","user":{"login":"fangpengcheng95","id":35449692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDQ5Njky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35449692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95","html_url":"https://github.com/fangpengcheng95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":224122270,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjQxMjIyNzA=","name":"flink-1","full_name":"fangpengcheng95/flink-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fangpengcheng95","id":35449692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDQ5Njky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35449692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95","html_url":"https://github.com/fangpengcheng95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fangpengcheng95/flink-1","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nremove surplus semicolon in Utils\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-29T02:11:34Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T15:09:36Z","closed_at":"2019-11-29T08:49:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d440eb89d9d5c606ff0de912b81553781ae77cc5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10353/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10353/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10353/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/cf2b40b6d31449d3ec41b2b94a4685d64adf9777","head":{"label":"fangpengcheng95:doc_fix","ref":"doc_fix","sha":"cf2b40b6d31449d3ec41b2b94a4685d64adf9777","user":{"login":"fangpengcheng95","id":35449692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDQ5Njky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35449692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95","html_url":"https://github.com/fangpengcheng95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":224122270,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjQxMjIyNzA=","name":"flink-1","full_name":"fangpengcheng95/flink-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fangpengcheng95","id":35449692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDQ5Njky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35449692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95","html_url":"https://github.com/fangpengcheng95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fangpengcheng95/flink-1","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-28T17:08:53Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T15:09:18Z","closed_at":"2019-11-28T21:05:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10352/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10352/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10352/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/07ab4e89c7c296b49e8c2a242be539b0ee9176d0","head":{"label":"GJL:FLINK-14651-loop-split-heavy","ref":"FLINK-14651-loop-split-heavy","sha":"07ab4e89c7c296b49e8c2a242be539b0ee9176d0","user":{"login":"GJL","id":1681921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODE5MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1681921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL","html_url":"https://github.com/GJL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62889945,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Mjg4OTk0NQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"GJL/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GJL","id":1681921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODE5MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1681921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL","html_url":"https://github.com/GJL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GJL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/GJL/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe State TTL RocksDb/file backend tests now contains thread safety issue during the call of MonotonicTTLTimeProvider.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* Synchronize all mailbox actions, so there is no need to acquire checkpoint lock in any code that is executed by the main task thread. This will further allow to drop getCheckpointLock() method from StreamTask\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - introduce `ExecutionDecorator` field in `StreamTask`, `MailboxProcessor`, `MailboxExecutor`\r\n  - use `SynchronizedExecutionDecorator` as a value for now\r\n  - later (another PR) only `SourceStreamTask` will use it. All other tasks will use a decorator which just executes the action directly\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is covered by a new `StreamTaskExecutionDecorationTest`, as well as existing tests: `SourceStreamTaskTest`, `StreamTaskTest`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **no**\r\n  -- code available through `@PublicEvolving` is modified: `AbstractStreamOperator.getContainingTask.getCheckpointLock` is dropped\r\n  - The serializers: **no**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **yes** (coarser lock granularity for SourceStreamTask)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: **no**\r\n  - The S3 file system

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\npropose a new functionality of KafkaTableSource which can consume multiple topics at the same time. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nDesign plan\r\n\r\n    Add a new constructor in KafkaTableSource which accepts topics with List type as one parameter.\r\n    Modify the existed one which only accepts one topic as string type to call the proposed one to finish the instantiation. That is to say, wrap this topic in a list and pass it to the multi-topics-consuming constructor.\r\n    Modify the overridden method createKafkaConsumer in KafkaTableSource to pass topics as List instead of String.\r\n    Replace the field topic with topics as List type in  KafkaTableSourceBase and modify every place using topic with topics. So we just need to modify the constructor KafkaTableSourceBase, method getDataStream, and equals and hashCode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nTest plan\r\n\r\n    There is less to do as KafkaTableSource is based on FlinkKafkaConsumer which already supports consuming multiple topics and is tested well. Of course, we can easily add further more tests if needed.\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-28T02:12:44Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T15:09:24Z","closed_at":"2019-11-29T01:47:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a5dffda2ce55ad64dc970fdfbceb1cb5dbe37a5a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273182709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgyNzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Kafka","name":"component=Connectors/Kafka","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10343/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10343/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10343/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/31a5d3deff6c5d1c8eff5ac6367523a3716d7f5b","head":{"label":"fangpengcheng95:master","ref":"master","sha":"31a5d3deff6c5d1c8eff5ac6367523a3716d7f5b","user":{"login":"fangpengcheng95","id":35449692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDQ5Njky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35449692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95","html_url":"https://github.com/fangpengcheng95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":224122270,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjQxMjIyNzA=","name":"flink-1","full_name":"fangpengcheng95/flink-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fangpengcheng95","id":35449692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDQ5Njky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35449692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95","html_url":"https://github.com/fangpengcheng95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fangpengcheng95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fangpengcheng95/flink-1","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis implements the data type extractor mentioned in FLIP-65. It is similar to Flink's core type information extractor but also adds a lot of SQL specific features and improves the overall user experience. In particular, it allows to annotate types, fields, and classes for parameterizing the extraction process. It is unified across Java and Scala.\r\n\r\nThe following description is copied from `DataTypeHint`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n * A hint that influences the reflection-based extraction of a {@link DataType}.\r\n *\r\n * <p>Data type hints can parameterize or replace the default extraction logic of individual function parameters\r\n * and return types, structured classes, or fields of structured classes. An implementer can choose to\r\n * what extent the default extraction logic should be modified.\r\n *\r\n * <p>The following examples show how to explicitly specify data types, how to parameterize the extraction\r\n * logic, or how to accept any data type as an input data type:\r\n *\r\n * <p>{@code @DataTypeHint(\"INT\")} defines an INT data type with a default conversion class.\r\n *\r\n * <p>{@code @DataTypeHint(value = \"TIMESTAMP(3)\", bridgedTo = java.sql.Timestamp.class)} defines a TIMESTAMP\r\n * data type of millisecond precision with an explicit conversion class.\r\n *\r\n * <p>{@code @DataTypeHint(value = \"RAW\", rawSerializer = MyCustomSerializer.class)} defines a RAW data type\r\n * with a custom serializer class.\r\n *\r\n * <p>{@code @DataTypeHint(version = V1, allowRawGlobally = TRUE)} parameterizes the extraction by requesting\r\n * a extraction logic version of 1 and allowing the RAW data type in this structured type (and possibly\r\n * nested fields).\r\n *\r\n * <p>{@code @DataTypeHint(bridgedTo = MyPojo.class, allowRawGlobally = TRUE)} defines that a type should be\r\n * extracted from the given conversion class but with parameterized extraction for allowing RAW types.\r\n *\r\n * <p>{@code @DataTypeHint(inputGroup = ANY)} defines that the input validation should accept any\r\n * data type.\r\n *\r\n * <p>Note: All hint parameters are optional. Hint parameters defined on top of a structured type are\r\n * inherited by all (deeply) nested fields unless annotated differently. For example, all occurrences of\r\n * {@link java.math.BigDecimal} will be extracted as {@code DECIMAL(12, 2)} if the enclosing structured\r\n * class is annotated with {@code @DataTypeHint(defaultDecimalPrecision = 12, defaultDecimalScale = 2)}. Individual\r\n * field annotations allow to deviate from those default values.\r\n */\r\n ```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Data type hint annotation added\r\n- Data type extractor added\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows: `DataTypeExtractorTest` and `DataTypeExtractorScalaTest`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is to change `StreamingJobGraphGenerator#setManagedMemoryFractionForOperator` to use `BigDecimal#divide(otherValue, scale, RoundMode.ROUND_DOWN)` to calculate managed memory fractions. In this way, the sum of the fractions will not exceed 1.0. \r\nOtherwise fractions summed up to be more than 1.0 may result in the last operator to fail to allocate managed memory it is supposed to be able to acquire.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Changed `StreamingJobGraphGenerator#setManagedMemoryFractionForOperator` to use `BigDecimal#divide(otherValue, scale, RoundMode.ROUND_DOWN)` to calculate managed memory fractions*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *The case StreamingJobGraphGeneratorTest#testManagedMemoryFractionForSpecifiedResourceSpec is adjusted to verify this change*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

(**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / **not documented**) - we do not want to make it too visible for the users yet. In the first version we primarily want to use it to support Hive's primary

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/flink/pull/8967 changed the Cassandra connector to catch `Exception` and release the semaphore correctly, however this is not general enough as e.g. `Error` can still lead to deadlock. Change code to catch all `Throwable` instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Release Semaphore correctly on all Throwable in send()\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - Added unit test that validates semaphore released if `Error` in send(); test fails before change.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nscala pattern matching can't handle \"NaN\",\"NegativeInfinity \" etc.\r\nin Flink planner module( GenerateUtils, CodeGenerator), some code logic fall into this issue.\r\nthe PR target to fix this. \r\n## Brief change log\r\nfix pattern matching issue in below classes:\r\norg.apache.flink.table.planner.codegen.GenerateUtils\r\norg.apache.flink.table.codegen.CodeGenerator\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is  covered by UT\r\norg.apache.flink.table.planner.codegen.GenerateUtilsTest\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: ( no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

no)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-27T09:24:45Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T01:45:56Z","closed_at":"2019-12-08T02:19:48Z","merged_at":"2019-12-08T02:19:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"3e28aedbaa85710aab34c0abb3a3973d73f7f805","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1341819565,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzQxODE5NTY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/LegacyPlanner","name":"component=TableSQL/LegacyPlanner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10333/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10333/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10333/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d80866c7bac11496c3547c3b38d2ca4100b55cb2","head":{"label":"caidezhi:FLINK-14970","ref":"FLINK-14970","sha":"d80866c7bac11496c3547c3b38d2ca4100b55cb2","user":{"login":"caidezhi","id":13580821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTgwODIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13580821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi","html_url":"https://github.com/caidezhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205780699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU3ODA2OTk=","name":"flink","full_name":"caidezhi/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"caidezhi","id":13580821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTgwODIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13580821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi","html_url":"https://github.com/caidezhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caidezhi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/caidezhi/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* This PR aims to separating checkpoint triggering into several asynchronous stages.\r\n* This is the heart part of threading model refactoring.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Unify all error handling of checkpoint failure.\r\n* Change the semantic from queued to suspended if there are too many in-flight checkpoints.\r\n* Separate the triggering from synchronous to asynchronous.\r\n  * The last commit is a bit large although I have done some preparations in the prior and this PR :(\r\n  * Introduces an `isTriggering` variable to avoid competition between in-flight checkpoint trigger and the later one. Because we have to keep the order of triggering and avoid concurrent competition.\r\n  * Introduces a `triggerRequestQueue` which is used to queue the trigger request which can't be triggered at that moment.\r\n  * There are only two exits of triggering, `onTriggerSuccess` and `OnTriggerFailure`. Either of them must be called at the end of triggering lifecycle. In there, we maintain the status of `isTriggering`.\r\n  * Do not invoke `CheckpointFailureManager#handleJobLevelCheckpointException` when trigger failure. It's useless for now. And it's also a blocking operation to get the current checkpoint id.\r\n  * There are lots of test cases need to change because `triggerCheckpoint` becomes an asynchronous operation. We need to manually trigger the asynchronous trigger stages.\r\n  * `triggerCheckpoint` will not throw exception directly even it fails at the very beginning. All error handling outside checkpoint coordinator should be through return value of `triggerCheckpoint`. In this way, we don't need \"try catch\" everywhere.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* There are a lot of existing test cases and this change also added tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: it should be no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is part fo FLIP-56. It extends `TaskExecutor` to support dynamic slot allocation.\r\nWith this PR, the `TaskExecutor` now supports both previous static slot allocation and the new dynamic allocation.\r\n- For dynamic slot allocation, a special `SlotID` (with negative slot index) needs to be provided, as well as a `ResourceProfile` to describe the requested slot resources.\r\n- For static slot allocation, a normal `SlotID` (with slot index in the range of `[0, slotNumber)`) needs to be provided. In such cases, the provided `ResourceProfile` will be ignored, and the default slot resource profile derived from configuration will be used.\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on #10146.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- 75d805dfaecb953e72cf84a4439e549a26118539..b083c68650acd6b097dc7049276df080196db26f: Commits of previous PRs.\r\n- aaf47129e5cc2adfd03c0c96749745b22937ee57: Hotfix of refactoring `TaskSlotTable` and `TaskSlot`.\r\n- 0fec80f46457a9f7bd4fdd783c68d4acfd1d65d6: Dynamically create a slot on allocation and destroy a slot on free.\r\n- 0fe0b6618d55bb1d111ed22f7692806bdb07075d: Support allocate slots without pre-defined slot id.\r\n- 8c661dbf866f0153c2c41b370c766e627817a0a6: Introduce `ResourceProfileBudgetManager.` for managing resource reserving and releasing of slots.\r\n- 8d126889bb9986eb575656e2be028c5357e3f1e2: Use `ResourceProfileBudgetManager.` to bookkeep allocated / available resources on the TM side.\r\n- a005c509ee928ea0e30d47a5a94946bd59622166: Generate slot report with TM available resources.\r\n- c54d7b94b9ca46e6b8dc2a072919ab0b1deed022: Task executor supports allocating slots with dynamic resources.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded unit test cases in `TaskSlotTableTest` and `TaskExecutorTest`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes WMI_WRONG_MAP_ITERATOR warnings reported by FindBugs.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nuse an iterator on the entrySet of the map, to avoid the Map.get(key) lookup.\r\nrelated class :\r\norg.apache.flink.formats.parquet.ParquetMapInputFormat\r\norg.apache.flink.graph.library.CommunityDetection\r\norg.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.fs.bucketing.BucketingSink (already marked as \"Deprecated\")\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?
