Description ##\r\nTo address PR comments in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14629\r\n1. Check train_data and val_data only supports dataloader, give proper error msg\r\n2. exposed batch_axis and set default 0\r\n3.  updated initialization logic, so fine-tuning use case (net partially initialized) will not get forced re-init.\r\n4. explained auto mode in checkpoint and early stopping, added docstring, warning and logging message when auto mode is used and np.greater/np.less is determined in auto mode.\r\n5. log learning rate every epoch\r\n6. update logic to save checkpoint based on epoch_period(default 1) and batch_period (default None)\r\n7. update checkpoint handler to save the following: symbol (1 time after first batch, if net is hybridizable), params and states per epcoh or batch, only keep a maximum number of checkpoints(default 5)\r\n8. added feature to resume training from checkpoints\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\nAdd cpu deformable_im2col implementation, also fix some errors in doc string.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nThe whole cpu part is implemented, and the code style is fixed to pass lint check.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-05T08:18:39Z","updated_at":"2019-05-24T02:00:45Z","closed_at":"2019-05-24T02:00:34Z","merged_at":"2019-05-24T02:00:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"eade26f651fd35da162a740f3e0f477e6239e47f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nAddress flaky test reports: #14835\r\n\r\nI cannot reproduce the error after thousands of running, so the only thing that is clear: non-zero exitcode with no error logs may happen when triggering OOM in spawned process.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses Cholesky factorization in cpu mode instead to trigger error in real execution.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nmulticlass-mcc metric enhancements\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Rename metric from \"PCC\" to \"MMCC\" because though the math is derived\r\n   from Pearson CC, it's utility is as a multiclass extension of Mathews CC.\r\n- [x] Harden mx.metric.MMCC.update to more variations of input format, similar to\r\n   mx.metric.Accuracy.update.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\nThe name change from `mx.metric.PCC()` to `mx.metric.MMCC()` for this metric has not yet been included in any releases or tagged branches, and for anyone following master the code update would be trivial.\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-03T23:01:49Z","updated_at":"2019-08-29T17:13:46Z","closed_at":"2019-08-29T17:13:46Z","merged_at":"2019-08-29T17:13:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"196d1f4b034e00a49e0798bc64a3d680e8a50f6c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

is a re-creation of https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14028. I've accidentally deleted my fork of `incubator-mxnet`.\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\n\r\nEases the pain of linking with OpenBLAS using cmake.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support to use the provided `OpenBLASConfig.cmake`.\r\n\r\n### Justification for the change\r\n\r\nThe standard way of linking with dependencies in CMake is via the `find_package()` mechanism ([docs](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html)). This mechanism provides 2 ways of finding the dependencies:\r\n- Config mode (uses a file named `OpenBLASConfig.cmake` (or `openblas-config.cmake`), which are provided by the dependency itself)\r\n- Module mode (uses a file named `FindOpenBLAS.cmake`, which is provided by either cmake or the project compiling the dependency, mxnet in this case)\r\n\r\nThe preferred way to find a dependency is if they provide their \"Config\" file, since the authors of the dependency are the ones who know best about the structure of their code and how they should be linked.\r\n\r\nWhen I tried to compile MXNet on Windows it didn't work well. My setup was:\r\n\r\n- Visual studio 2017.\r\n- OpenBLAS package from the SourceForge binaries package, as specified in the [documentation to build MXNet on Windows from source](http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/versions/master/install/windows_setup.html#build-from-source).\r\n\r\nIt failed because this binary package is compiled with a Visual Studio version prior to 2015. So I would get the error `unresolved external symbol __imp____iob_func`. The reasons are explained here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30412951/unresolved-external-symbol-imp-fprintf-and-imp-iob-func-sdl2\r\n\r\nThen I tried to use the [conda-forge package](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/openblas). This almost worked.\r\n\r\nOn further inspection of the [FindOpenBLAS.cmake](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/cmake/Modules/FindOpenBLAS.cmake) and the conda-forge package, I noticed that MXNet didn't use the provided \"cmake Config mode\" files (`OpenBLASConfig.cmake`). It tried to find the library all by itself, which is an \"anti-pattern\" when using cmake. So I thought that this could be an opportunity to be able to contribute to the project by improving this module.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add , tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\nI have tested this by compiling it on Windows and Linux.\r\n\r\nTo provide OpenBLAS I have tried:\r\n\r\nOn Linux:\r\n- compiled OpenBLAS from source with cmake and installed it\r\n- compiled OpenBLAS from source with make and installed it\r\n\r\nOn Windows:\r\n- used the compiled OpenBLAS package from conda-forge: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/openblas\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\nThe previous implementation of LayerNorm is incorrect because it wrongly calculated the size of the reduction workspace.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Fix LayerNorm bug, test\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n```\r\nMXNET_TEST_COUNT=1000000 nosetests

Description ##\r\nfix https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14833 \r\nAs we changed unknown shape in mxnet from 0 to -1, some operators infer shape logic could be wrong. \r\nMXNet unit tests are not testing for this corner case, but Keras-MXNet relies heavily on parietal shape infer, so many unit tests are failing.\r\n1. changed `CHECK_GE` and `CHECK_LE` to compare `ndim()` with signed int as LHS could be -1 now.\r\n2. For some operators. when a tensor shape is entirely unknown, we should return directly. But we need to use `ndim_is_known` instead of `shape_is_known`. Because we can still continue to infer shape if tensor shape if partially unknown.  Using `shape_is_known` will cause a direct return unless the tensor shape is fully known. \r\n\r\n3. For binary ops, if LHS and RHS both have fully unknown shapes, we should return directly.  `dot` ops is missing this logic.\r\n\r\n4. added unit tests\r\n\r\nThis fixes failing keras-mxnet unit tests.\r\n\r\nThanks to @reminisce for helping me debug and figure out the changes needed!\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-03T06:00:58Z","updated_at":"2019-05-21T18:40:48Z","closed_at":"2019-05-21T18:40:48Z","merged_at":"2019-05-21T18:40:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"5854b98c0a2c3755af2a8df3235af0266f7bfcd5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nUpdate TensorRT tutorial to build-from-source.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-02T17:51:22Z","updated_at":"2019-11-27T17:51:01Z","closed_at":"2019-11-27T17:51:01Z","merged_at":"2019-11-27T17:51:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"7713a43353b06b91ae7d5d508868b42ce557e487","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

(i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\nThe Jetson instructions didn't work for me on the Nano, so I worked through a bunch of the errors and came up with these fixes.\r\n\r\nThe goal was to get around the really long compile time locally on the device and to use cross-compilation. \r\nI also thought it would be nice to use the Java API for inference-only applications.\r\n\r\nSo this PR gets you MXNet v1.4.1:\r\n* [Pre-compiled binary for Jetson arch](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mxnet-public/install/jetson/1.4.1/libmxnet.so)\r\n* [A Python wheel for Jetson arch](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mxnet-public/install/jetson/1.4.1/mxnet-1.4.1-py3-none-any.whl)\r\n* Instructions on how to roll your own via Docker or manually\r\n\r\n## Gotchas \r\n* There's no mention of the `MSHADOW_USE_PASCAL` setting in the CI cross-compile route. This probably needs to be addressed, but I'm not sure of the impact. This PR ignores it just as the current setup that uses Docker/CI does.\r\n\r\n## Java Support Excluded (updated)\r\nThanks @lanking520 and @zachgk for helping on the Java stuff. And @larroy for general Jetson help.\r\n\r\nI used a workaround to get v1.4.1 for Java, but it doesn't work on the Nano due to some hard-coded build flags that are for Intel chipsets. Removing the flag manually resulted in other errors asking for configuration. I don't know enough about cross-compiling to sort out these issues. Combine that with it being really hard to reproduce for v1.4.1, I'm letting this go for this PR. Maybe someone else can look at getting the Java API to work with 1.5.0 on the Nano.\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-01T19:11:15Z","updated_at":"2019-07-01T23:23:40Z","closed_at":"2019-07-01T23:23:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1acbba7459880d91d0446256fe5bbb5b1f922df8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-30T18:51:26Z","updated_at":"2019-05-02T20:36:05Z","closed_at":"2019-05-02T20:36:05Z","merged_at":"2019-05-02T20:36:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"33e8845cc20b482376d04acf07250f7da9096d1a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThe [Clojure BERT example](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/contrib/clojure-package/examples/bert-qa)'s `infer` function accepts a CPU/GPU context, which the command line\r\nversion of this example exposes as a `:cpu`/`:gpu` keyword. Previously, these options were ignored and the context was always overridden to the default context (CPU). This PR allows users (both REPL and shell) to pass in a GPU context.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] ~~The PR title

Description ##\r\nRegarding #12681 we should now write running_mean and running_var in the docblocks. The current code is using running_mean and running_var in Gluon BatchNorm and SyncBatchNorm object constructor, but the current docblock is using moving_mean and moving_var, so the docblock should be changed to be consistent with the code to avoid user confusion.\r\n\r\nAlthough we should use moving_xxx for BatchNorm according the original BatchNorm paper and our backend, we should not break our old Gluon API in minor release. I have put this into MXNet 2.0 roadmap https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/9686#issuecomment-487217996, and we will make a complete fix down the line.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n###

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis refactor improves the code in the backward pass. Breaks a long function into smaller functions with more semantic variables that indicate what's happening and the intention. This makes the code hopefully bit easier to maintain.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-29T19:03:26Z","updated_at":"2019-09-08T03:58:47Z","closed_at":"2019-09-08T03:58:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1e4fc84085dd4d8b82ce293d322842a0829635f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"gigasquid","id":340299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDI5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid","html_url":"https://github.com/gigasquid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"rahul003","id":3457240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTcyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3457240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003","html_url":"https://github.com/rahul003","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"reques

items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nNumpy-compatible version of dot with existing kernels and new kernels.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] numpy.dot case 1: vector dot\r\n- [x] numpy.dot case 2: 2-D matrix multiplication\r\n- [x] numpy.dot

Description ##\r\nThis PR brings below changes to ImageRecordIter:\r\n\r\n* Add new parameter `dtype`, making ImageRecordIter(dtype='uint8') equivalent to  ImageRecordUInt8Iter.\r\n* Add new optional parameter `ctx`, which indicates the device context used for. When `ctx='cpu'` is specified,  a CPU backend optimized data loader will be used.\r\n* Add new CPU backend optimized implementation. In this implementation, data_loader is working as a engine operator. Overall throughput get improved, and allow profiling data_loader overhead with built-in profiler.\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv @xinyu-intel @anirudh2290 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nThis PR enables below fusion pattern for MKLDNN backend:\r\n\r\nFP32:\r\nconv+sigmoid\r\nconv+tanh\r\nconv+softrelu\r\nconv+clip(0, n)  #(when n=6, it's mxnet version of relu6)\r\n\r\nINT8:\r\nconv+clip(0, n)  #(when n=6, it's mxnet version of relu6)\r\n\r\nMinor change:\r\n* Fix a bug of partitioning mobilenetV2. The bug is, when loop is detected, build subgraph pass will try to break the loop and try again. During the retry, selector may contain internal state from previous selection, causing unexpected result. The fix is to add `reset` API for selector to clean up internal state.\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv @reminisce @anirudh2290\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to

work\r\n4. enhance the checks in SupportMKLDNNSoftmax\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-26T17:31:12Z","updated_at":"2019-06-21T22:11:33Z","closed_at":"2019-04-29T23:04:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"84238661f41f163a8ce2e89881e69d90f236ef61","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gigasquid","id":340299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDI5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid","html_url":"https://github.com/gigasquid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-

nightly tests are failing because no one is publishing this stash: http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/NightlyTestsForBinaries/detail/master/292/pipeline\r\n\r\nFrom \"Build / CPU: USE_INT64_TENSOR_SIZE\", it publishes `ubuntu_cpu_int64`, when it should be `cpu_int64`\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\n\r\nThe PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14570 has introduced a bug where the \"stash name\" is not matching:\r\n\r\n- It is **packed** as `ubuntu_cpu_int64`\r\n- It is **unpacked** as `cpu_int64`\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-26T12:04:54Z","updated_at":"2019-04-26T21:39:52Z","closed_at":"2019-04-26T15:18:46Z","merged_at":"2019-04-26T15:18:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"680badef6e8f66624bff11a4e5121001f81169e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review

reverts commit c437d5b789c9d9892522a9c32ef6e6f20785a3a2.\r\n\r\nThe current design is problematic, leading the issue #14730, and the new .so file is not necessary.\r\nBecause the release 1.5 is very near and I talked with @triplekings and @eric-haibin-lin offline, \r\nwe prefer to revert this change for r1.5 and @triplekings will re-org the code to move the API to contrib folder after the release.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-26T01:07:24Z","updated_at":"2019-04-30T15:14:08Z","closed_at":"2019-04-30T13:37:09Z","merged_at":"2019-04-30T13:37:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"1238aa09f068e3e6c6be436b995019712cca2e4a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc

from PR #14750\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\n\r\nSplit random functions in their own generated namespace.\r\n\r\n* `ndarray_random_api`\r\n* `symbol_random_api`\r\n\r\nIt renames the following functions to be as close as possible to the scala names:\r\n* `-random-randint` into `randint` \r\n* `sample-randint` into `randint-like`for instance and put them under `ndarray-random-api` namespace.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n* Unify random and sample functions (mu vs loc and sigma)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds large tensor test cases for 2 more ops mentioned in the title. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-25T08:48:16Z","updated_at":"2019-05-09T04:50:12Z","closed_at":"2019-05-09T04:50:12Z","merged_at":"2019-05-09T04:50:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"8dddac0ccd8a07ee428b63e163bf059048a93fe4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThe range is actually including 1 due to division by 255 (not 256)\r\n\r\nFixes #14786\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThe tests (and probably users too) were already using the implemented behaviour not the documented one. So this just fixes the docu","created_at":"2019-04-25T07:33:03Z","updated_at":"2019-06-09T05:12:06Z","closed_at":"2019-06-09T05:12:06Z","merged_at":"2019-06-09T05:12:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"b64e00a26dd6e00a3c057880ec41b0f46827fcfb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":708228884,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDgyMjg4ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Gluon","name":"Gluon","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv @xinyu-intel @junrushao1994 \r\nWhen gluon model hybridize with `static_shape=True, static_alloc=True`, cached_op with static mode will be used. For this situation, we should try to cache operator state for better performance. This PR is to enable this feature to speed up gluon inference speed, especially for small batch sizes.\r\n\r\nBelow data is collected on SKX-8180 28 cores, **SKX GLUON INT8 OPT** shows the performance

Description ##\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14736\r\nImage_classification.py was not working as data preparation script was moved under specific super_resolution example. \r\nIntroduced in this PR: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14179\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-23T23:25:32Z","updated_at":"2019-04-29T06:41:34Z","closed_at":"2019-04-27T01:39:01Z","merged_at":"2019-04-27T01:39:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"40e3d7c8e8be9ce0c506ebd709fda8a2b0b8a113","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR now removes all usages of NDArrayCollector throughout the code and deprecates it as of the 1.5.0 release.\r\n\r\nIt also updates the ResourceScope to recursively move NDArrays to outer scope when in hierarchical structure of Traversables (list, set, map, etc.) and Products (tuples). It adds a method to check if the ResourceScope contains a value and fixes a bug where moveToOuterScope would move a value to the outer scope despite it not being in the inner scope in the first place.\r\n\r\nThis contains additions originally part of #14666 that were split out.\r\n\r\n@lanking520 @andrewfayres @nswamy \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge,

Description ##\r\nFix the bug that reduction operators would not produce the correct value for integer type inputs due to bug in MXNET_ACC_TYPE_SWITCH.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Fix ACC_TYPE_SWITCH macro\r\n- [x] Extra test for integer norm\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n@reminisce

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis adds a fine tuning example for BERT based off of the following Gluon NLP example\r\n\r\n[https://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/examples/sentence_embedding/bert.html](https://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/examples/sentence_embedding/bert.html)\r\n\r\nThere is a PR in the GluonNLP repo for the export script https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/pull/672\r\n\r\nThe original BERT infer example directory has been changed from `bert-qa` to `bert` to accomodate both the QA example and this one.\r\n\r\nA walkthrough in the form of a Jupyter notebook has been provided for the sentence pair classification based off of the Gluon NLP one. A markdown version of the notebook has also been provided for those who don't have the `lein-jupyter` plugin.\r\n\r\nExample results for sentence pair classification after 3 epochs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSpeedometer: epoch  2  count  7  metric  [accuracy 0.69921875]\r\nSpeedometer: epoch  2  count  8  metric  [accuracy 0.7013889]\r\nSpeedometer: epoch  2  count  9  metric  [accuracy 0.690625]\r\nSpeedometer: epoch  2  count  10  metric  [accuracy 0.69034094]\r\nSpeedometer: epoch  2  count  11  metric  [accuracy 0.6953125]\r\nSpeedometer: epoch  2  count  12  metric  [accuracy 0.7019231]\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is comparable to the sentence embedding results in the gluon nlp notebook\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Epoch 2 Batch 4/18] loss=0.6563, lr=0.0000050, acc=0.638\r\n[Epoch 2 Batch 8/18] loss=0.5937, lr=0.0000050, acc=0.676\r\n[Epoch 2 Batch 12/18] loss=0.5657, lr=0.0000050, acc=0.690\r\n[Epoch 2 Batch 16/18] loss=0.6428, lr=0.0000050, acc=0.674\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Move BERT QA infer example within a broader BERT example\r\n- Add BERT Sentence Pair Classification Example along with notebook\r\n- Tweak the Callback Speedometer so that the results will be printed out in the notebook instead of having to look at the console for the logging.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nCurrently the fit api [provide user with default event handlers](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/fit-api/python/mxnet/gluon/contrib/estimator/estimator.py#L236)(metric, validation, logging) if none is specified. \r\nIt could be troublesome for users if they want to use a different logging handler but have to write the code for metric and validation handler again.\r\nWe can provide default handlers one by one, but default handlers use metrics prepared by `estimator.prepare_loss_and_metrics()`, if user used another set of metrics for user defined handlers ([example](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14765/files#diff-2fbf07e4152ad556d0023ed58c33646fR346) in test case). The metrics may not be updated correctly. We need to give a warning and add relevant checks if a mix of default and user defined handlers are used.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n1. provide default handlers one by one\r\n2. check whether default handler and user created handler are using the same set of metrics\r\n3. added unit test, update unit test helper function name\r\n4. further combined nightly test into one runtime function and run under nightly for binaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-1396](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-1396) created\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n1. provide default handlers one by one\r\n2. check whether default handler and user created handler are using the same set of metrics\r\n3. added unit test, update unit test helper function name\r\n4. further combined nightly test into one runtime function and run under nightly for binaries.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nSoftmax operator was recently changed to cast the accumulator type to higher precision data type(in #14098) than the input type regardless of the whether the `dtype` of the output is passed to the operator or not. This not only breaks backward compatibility but also the  increases loss when training a rnn language model with float32 input data type. Details are https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14722. \r\n\r\nThis PR changes the accumulator type only if the `dtype` has been passed and uses the `dtype` passed for accumulation.

refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds necessary infrastructural components to support numpy operators in imperative programming and Gluon APIs.\r\n1. Namespace `mxnet.numpy` is used for registering numpy ops used in imperative programming as how people use the official NumPy package.\r\n2. Namepsaces `mxnet.ndarray.numpy` and `mxnet.symbol.numpy` are for registering numpy ops used in Gluon APIs dispatched by `F`. Users, for example, can use `np.sum` in Gluon as `F.np.sum`.\r\n3. A new `ndarray` class that is visible to users with the same convenience fluent methods as in official `numpy.ndarray`. Currently, it only supports data layout of c-contiguous. Strides and other storage types will be supported in the future.\r\n4. A new `_NumpySymbol` class that is transparent to users. This type of objects are created automatically by the underlying mechanism in Gluon `HybridBlock` for building computational graphs after `hybridize()` is called. It provides the same set of convenience fluent methods as `ndarray` and users should not interact with it directly.\r\n5. All numpy ops generate tensors of type `ndarray`, instead of the classic `NDArray`. This includes both imperative_invoke and CachedOp. In the situations where CachedOp is used, the output tensors' types are determined by the immediate operators that create them. If an output is generated by a numpy op, it is of type `ndarray`; if generated by a legacy op, it is of type `NDArray`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge,

refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-22T05:22:59Z","updated_at":"2019-04-25T22:39:49Z","closed_at":"2019-04-25T22:39:49Z","merged_at":"2019-04-25T22:39:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"97e09f23cfdc1f5a3f794e4a5f539b502b4e7731","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":206159502,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDYxNTk1MDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":707583550,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1ODM1NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Build","name":"Build","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

the forking process tries to access the same context, causing initialization error.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds checking on exitcode of forking process and removes this test in gpu tests.\r\n\r\nBTW, right now the correct way to fork mxnet is to do it when the CUDA context is not created, otherwise CUDA error is very likely to happen, maybe we should add some warning in docs?\r\n\r\n## Checklist

Description ##\r\n\r\nIf I have a pre-qauntized model from another framework, e.g Tensorflow or Pyrtorch and want to use Mxnet as inference engine, I would like to be able to set the int8 weights,

Currently `F.contrib.requantize(....)` and `F.contrib.dequantize(....)` fail when `F` is a symbol, i.e, after calling `hybradize()` on the network. For more detailed error example please look at the [jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-1397). In this CR I am enabaling `requantize` and `dequantize` to be called from symbolic API.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n-

for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nchange mxnet_option behavior\r\n \r\nIn the past, when the condition in mxnet_option was false, the option would be deleted completely instead of set to `OFF`. This is not the expected behavior. Now, change it to set to `OFF` when the condition is false.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\nThis patch is to fix the build error of  using \"size_t\" within for loop on Windows Platform, since MSVC only support OpenMP 2.0  standard,  which will cause the \"error C3016: 'i' : index variable in OpenMP 'for' statement must have signed integral type\".\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable

Description ##\r\nFix for https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14340\r\nThere was caching in backward operator in legacy_op_util , due to this caching inputs to backward was not properly initialized and resulted in wrong results when backward was called 2nd time with retain-graph=True. Fix is to remove the caching so that inputs can be initialized properly.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- There was caching in backward operator in legacy_op_util , due to this caching inputs to backward was not properly initialized and resulted in wrong results when backward was called 2nd time with retain-graph=True\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThis PR allows users to convert numpy's NDArray without copying content data. This is achieved by converting numpy's NDArray to `DLManagedTensor`, which is introduced in https://github.com/dmlc/dlpack/pull/38. We expect that this would help users reduce major performance bottleneck when this conversion is conducted frequently.\r\n\r\nSee also: #14244.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Rewrite `NDArray::FromDLPack` to make it resource safe.\r\n- [x] Add DLManagedTensor and its deleter via ctypes that allows C++ side deletes it.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nNothing.\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-18T08:00:19Z","updated_at":"2019-07-23T10:47:32Z","closed_at":"2019-04-28T23:12:01Z","merged_at":"2019-04-28T23:12:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"c18381d336e1d2f950c6d11841db15c94062cce4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nThis PR is to add licences for all static-dependencies. These licenese are not applicable to user who chose to build from source with all depdendencies dynamically-linked. But static-linking are required to place it under the generated package (e.g pip wheel, maven jars).\r\n@zachgk @szha \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge,

features ###\r\n- Single layer/Multiple layer and unidirectional/bidirectional inference by mkldnn lstm and vrnn with tanh and relu)\r\n\r\n### Unit-test changes ###\r\n- Using existing test case in test_operator.py to check consistency with original RNN Cell implementation.\r\n\r\n### Performance ###\r\nWe have tested performance of FusedRNN  (USE_MKLDNN = 0 and 1) on our local Skylake-8180 with 1 Sockets and 28 cores. Use MKL as blas lib in this performance test.\r\nTest input size is from DS2 default parameters(seq_length = 300, batch_size = 20, input_size = 800, hidden_size = 800). with MKLDNN commit

Description ##\r\nBecause of https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/8968, mxnet will random crash after USE_GPERFTOOLS = 1. Some end-user may get trouble if gperf-tools is  pre-installed. So before fix this, we'd better to disable it by default.\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @szha\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [
