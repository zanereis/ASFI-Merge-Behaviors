deterministic.**https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getDeclaredMethods--  \r\nAnnotationComparator uses getDeclaredMethods() to get a Method[], and the comparator will compare the Method[] using its elements.   \r\nWe want member1 and member2 to compare the same type of element during the comparison. We do not want to use a \"name\" to compare with a \"number\".\r\nSo, we sorted the array to get the element location fixed. The Method[] will only be used in this comparator and not used anywhere else. The developer says in their comments that this function is rarely used, therefore the sorting efficiency can be ignored. All in all, it is safe to make this change to make the Method[] deterministic.\r\n```\r\n    private static class AnnotationComparator implements Comparator<Annotation>\r\n    {\r\n\r\n        //

This PR allows OWB to skip rather than fail with an error if `@New` is not available on the classpath.","created_at":"2023-01-20T11:29:48Z","updated_at":"2023-01-20T14:18:52Z","closed_at":"2023-01-20T14:18:52Z","merged_at":"2023-01-20T14:18:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"b080f05df5a9001247ce578389ba99aac7ef361c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwebbeans/pulls/46/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwebbeans/pulls/46/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwebbeans/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwebbeans/issues/46/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwebbeans/statuses/2b8731a32741c3cbeb4740364da954b3830fc55d","head":{"label":"jgallimore:jg-experimental","ref":"jg-experimental","sha":"2b8731a32741c3cbeb4740364da954b3830fc55d","user":{"login":"jgallimore","id":548624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODYyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/548624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgallimore","html_url":"https://github.com/jgallimore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgallimore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgallimore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgallimore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgallimore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgallimore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgallimore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgallimore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgallimore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgallimore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":155295307,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTUyOTUzMDc=","name":"openwebbeans","full_name":"jgallimore/openwebbeans","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jgallimore","id":548624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODYyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/548624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgallimore","html_url":"https://github.com/jgallimore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgallimore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgallimore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgallimore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgallimore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgallimore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgallimore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgallimore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgallimore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgallimore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jgallimore/openwebbeans","description":"Mirror

am from the Software Testing research group at the University of Illinois. We want to inform that the tests org.apache.webbeans.test.annotation.binding.BeanCacheKeyUnitTest.testEquals2Annotations and\r\norg.apache.webbeans.test.annotation.binding.BeanCacheKeyUnitTest.testEquals2AnnotationsUnorderedParam are non deterministic. The non determinism has been discovered using the NonDex tool for catching non-deterministic/flaky tests (https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex).\r\n\r\nYou may reproduce the non deterministic behavior using the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repo and cd into it.\r\n2. `mvn install -am -pl webbeans-impl -DskipTests`\r\n3. `mvn -pl webbeans-impl test -Dtest=org.apache.webbeans.test.annotation.binding.BeanCacheKeyUnitTest#testEquals2Annotations `\r\n4. Confirm that the test passes as is.\r\n5. `mvn -pl webbeans-impl edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:1.1.2:nondex -Dtest=rg.apache.webbeans.test.annotation.binding.BeanCacheKeyUnitTest#testEquals2Annotations` \r\n6. This will run the NonDex tool on the test. You will find the test fails.\r\n\r\nProposed fix:\r\nAs you have indicated in line 298 of BeanCacheKey.java, the order of list members are actually non determininstic because the nature of getDeclaredMethods(). I wrote a simple comparator that simply compares the describing string of the Method object, and sort the array based on that to make the order determininstic.","created_at":"2022-10-28T04:27:33Z","updated_at":"2022-11-18T16:16:47Z","closed_at":"2022-11-18T16:16:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d79318fdccd3b32e7ab6f30869c5228d5a41757b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwebbeans/pulls/45/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwebbeans/pulls/45/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwebbeans/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwebbeans/issues/45/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwebbeans/statuses/858f9d74d73a432edac08a61b566fc887e2068ca","head":{"label":"ycliu28:flaky-test","ref":"flaky-test","sha":"858f9d74d73a432edac08a61b566fc887e2068ca","user":{"login":"ycliu28","id":28588062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTg4MDYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28588062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycliu28","html_url":"https://github.com/ycliu28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycliu28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycliu28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycliu28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycliu28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycliu28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycliu28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycliu28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycliu28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycliu28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":558686765,"node_id":"R_kgDOIUziLQ","name":"openwebbeans","full_name":"ycliu28/openwebbeans","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ycliu28","id":28588062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTg4MDYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28588062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycliu28","html_url":"https://github.com/ycliu28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycliu28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycliu28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycliu28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycliu28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycliu28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycliu28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycliu28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycliu28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ycliu28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ycliu28/openwebbeans","description":"Apache
