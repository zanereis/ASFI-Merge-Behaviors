supports resolving schemaLocations relative to a jar URI, which only looks for the schemaLocation in that same jar. Such jar URI's usually look like this:\r\n\r\n  jar:file:/path/to/some.jar!/path/to/schema.dfdl.xsd\r\n\r\nTo resolve a path relative to this, we split this into its components: a jar part and the resource path part inside that jar and resolve the schemaLocation relative to the path part.\r\n\r\nAlthough Java does not support loading resources within nested jars, tools like Spring Boot have added such support. This can result in jar URIs that look like this:\r\n\r\n  jar:file:/path/to/outer.jar!/path/to/inner.jar!/path/to/schema.dfdl.xsd\r\n\r\nThis breaks our current code because we expect there to only be two components, but we end up with three because of the multiple exclamation points.\r\n\r\nTo fix this and to support nested jars, this changes the logic to only split on the last exclamation point. Everything before that is considered the jar component and everything after is considered the path component in that jar, which could be a nested jar. We then resolve relative paths to this path component as usual and look for the result to be in that same jar component.\r\n\r\nDAFFODIL-2892","created_at":"2024-04-22T15:16:37Z","updated_at":"2024-04-23T14:57:16Z","closed_at":"2024-04-23T14:57:12Z","merged_at":"2024-04-23T14:57:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"a853a2fc6d06ad393071b3df48bbfc8d9a01ebec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/pulls/1223/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/pulls/1223/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/1223/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/statuses/71602c0128c9ac4bf7fea0960e68afa884dcadd2","head":{"label":"stevedlawrence:daffodil-2892-nested-jars","ref":"daffodil-2892-nested-jars","sha":"71602c0128c9ac4bf7fea0960e68afa884dcadd2","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108402545,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDg0MDI1NDU=","name":"daffodil","full_name":"stevedlawrence/daffodil","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence/daffodil","description":"Apache

we need to add an implied sequence for a choice branch (like when the branch is an array), we wrap the branch Term in a ChoiceBranchImpliedSequence, which is essentially a Sequence that passes logic through to the underlying Term. This allows us to use existing sequence logic such as creating repetition parsers for arrays.\r\n\r\nHowever, when we create this ChoiceBranchImpliedSequence we set its xml parameter to the xml of the Term it wraps. And because it extends Sequence, it does all the normal sequence logic of parsing that xml, even though much of it is never used because most logic passes through to the underlying Term.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, this works fine (although its wasted effort) since all that extra work is simply ignored. But, if that XML contains any expressions, things can quickly go off the rails as it tries to compile expressions with the context of this implied sequence.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, instead of passing in the XML of the underlying Term, we just pass in an empty sequence XML. This means there is no longer any real work for the ChoiceBranchImpliedSequence to do, except for be a tool to create the necessary repetition parsers to wrap around the Term.

if a required array in an unseparated sequence is missing from an infoset then we create an unparse error. However, if that required but missing array is followed by another array in the infoset then we abort. This is incorrect--we should create an unparse error just like other cases.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, this modifies the unseparated sequence unparser logic so that we first check if this event is even for this array. If it is, then it must be an start event and we perform the normal logic. If it isn't, then it means we have zero occurrences of this array and the event must have been the start event for a following element or the end event for a parent element. Either way, we check if zero occurrences is valid for this array and create an unparse error if not.

common source of differences in our release artifacts are embedded timestamps. The latest version of sbt-native-packager, used to create these artifacts now supports the SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH environment variable which provides control over these embedded timestamps.\r\n\r\nWhen building the release candidate, we now set the SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH to the UNIX timestamp of when the commit being built was merged (i.e. the git \"committer\" time), allowing for reproducible builds. There are some caveats:\r\n\r\n* The MSI installer includes one UUID and timestamp that cannot be changed. Fortunately, msidiff shows this is the only difference so is straightforward to verify\r\n* The RPM created by the release candidate script embeds a GPG signature which has a timestamp of when the signature was created, which cannot be changed. To verify RPM reproducibility, the signature must removed with rpmsign --delsign\r\n* Zip files still include a timestamp in an extended header.

[!NOTE]  \r\n> This might want to wait until 3.8.0 or a later release where we can fix all the prefix length issues \r\n\r\nIf parsing a prefix length fails, we just pretend the value was zero and rely on callers to check the processor status and ignore the zero value if it failed. However, even if the parse fails we still do the negative prefix length SDE checks. And if the prefix has an adjustment due to the prefixIncludesPrefixLength property, that zero is a adjusted to become negative and causes an SDE instead of a PE.\r\n\r\nReally, we shouldn't do these SDE checks at all if we failed to parse a prefix length since the zero is meaningless and should be ignored.

commit fixes the remaining issues open about Daffodil's Layers extension/plugins. Partial progress was in commit ff9ba4. This finishes that work.\r\n\r\n- DAFFODIL-2845 - Layer Improvements (umbrella ticket)\r\n- DAFFODIL-2844 - LayerNotEnoughDataException ...\r\n- DAFFODIL-2825 - Define Supported Layering API\r\n- DAFFODIL-2841 - Layers do not support created SDE or PE/UE Errors\r\n- DAFFODIL-2843 - How to create PE/UE from a layer\r\n\r\nThe layer API is all defined in Java clases and interfaces now.  One of the built-in layers (Gzip) is written in Java now.\r\n\r\nThere is only one layer property now: dfdlx:layer which takes a QName of the layer class.\r\n\r\nLayer classes are derived from\r\n\r\n    org.apache.daffodil.runtime1.layers.api.Layer\r\n\r\nA layer a name and target namespace, and hence a QName is required to identify it. This namespace is OWNED by the layer. All DFDL variables defined in that namespace are either used to pass parameters to the layer code, or receive results (such as a checksum) back from the layer code. This is enforced. A layer that has no DFDL variables does not have to define a DFDL schema that defines the layer's target namespace, but any layer that uses DFDL variables *must* define a schema with the layer's namespace as its target namespace, with the variables declared in it (using dfdl:defineVariable).\r\n\r\nThere is also an abstract base class for defining checksum layers called,\r\n\r\n    org.apache.daffodil.runtime1.layers.api.ChecksumLayer\r\n\r\nAll the layer properties about layer length kinds etc. are gone.\r\n\r\ndfdlx:layerLengthKind='boundaryMark' and dfdlx:boundaryMark properties are replaced by a layer named 'boundaryMark'.\r\n\r\ndfdlx:layerLengthKind='explicit' and dfdlx:layerLength properties are replaced by a layer named 'fixedLength'.\r\n\r\ndfdlx:layerLengthKind='implicit' is replaced by just not using one of the two above layers.\r\n\r\ndfdlx:layerTransform is replaced by just dfdlx:layer and is now a QName.  Layers no longer have both transformers and length-limiters mixed together.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to do explicit layer limiting, that differ in an important way.\r\n\r\nIf you use 'implicit' layer length (no restriction layer), and constrain the layer length by a surrounding element of specified length, then the layer length is controlled when parsing, but NOT controlled when unparsing.\r\n\r\nIf you use the layer \"fixedLength\", that dictates the parse and unparse length to be the value of the layerLength variable. Similarly if you use a checksum layer built with the ChecksumLayer base class, the length is controlled for both parsing and unparsing as it works like the fixedLength layer.\r\n\r\nLayer Variables:\r\n\r\nEach variable is either a parameter passed to a special setter named setLayerVariableParameters, or is a return variable which is populated from a special getter. The special setter args and getters taken together must use up all the DFDL variables defined in the layer's namespace. (See the javadoc for the Layer base class.)\r\n\r\nA special getter example might be:\r\n\r\n   int getLayerVariableResult_checksum() { .... }\r\n\r\nThis corresponds to, and returns the value that populates, the DFDL variable named 'checksum' in the layer's namespace. That DFDL variable must have a DFDL type corresponding to the int type (xs:unsignedShort or xs:int).\r\n\r\nLayers could have multiple result variables, but we have no actual examples of more than one value being returned.  (Returning multiple variables is tested. We just have no real use cases for it at this time.)\r\n\r\nLayer Exception Handling:\r\n\r\nAdded setProcessingErrorException(...) method to Layer\r\n\r\nThis allows the layer to specify that if the layer throws specific exceptions or runtime exceptions that they are converted into processing errors. This eliminates most need for layers to contain try-catches.\r\n\r\nAdditional Fixes in this Commit:\r\n\r\nFixed gzip layer which was not constructing on Java 17 or 21 due to static initializer differences of some sort.\r\n\r\nRemoved restriction that a layer can only have a single term inside it.\r\n\r\nAdded close() to InputSourceDataInputStream, as we weren't closing these. They now implement java.io.Closeable so can use try-with-resources for auto closing in Java.\r\n\r\nThere are a large number of simplifications in the \"layering\" of the various layer-related implementation classes.\r\n\r\nLayerRegistry is gone, merged into LayerFactory, which is gone, merged into LayerDriver.\r\n\r\nIn the examples/tests for layering: Changed check digit bad digit style to construct an always-invalid element instead of an assertion failure.\r\n\r\nAbout Testing:\r\n\r\nThe testing is quite extensive now. There are tests for every way that a user can goof up the definition of a layer class, and there are tests for processingError, runtimeSchemaDefinitionError, and throwing an Exception from every place a user-defined Layer could cause these. Parse errors cause backtracking in all sensible cases. Nothing aborts.\r\n\r\nProtecting every place that layer code is called from any sort of error/throw requires quite a number of try/catch blocks. This may have performance implications.\r\n\r\nAdd some fuzz testing around gzip layer\r\n\r\nGZip layer converts IOExceptions to PE explicitly.\r\n\r\nFuzz tests show that gzip does a good job converting various bad data issues into IOException, so\r\nreally that's the only one the GzipLayer has to deal with.\r\n\r\nChanged boundaryMarkLayer and gzip layer and AIS (test) layer to use setProcessingErrorException to handle IOExceptions.\r\n\r\n(and the test SimpleBombOutLayer.scala used to drive negative tests.)\r\n\r\nAdded bug-related comments to other files about bugs discovered while fuzz-testing of other non-daffodil layer schemas.\r\n\r\nDEPRECATION/COMPATABILITY\r\n\r\nThis new Layer API is 100% incompatible with schemas or layer code from Daffodil 3.6.0 and all prior versions of Daffodil. The layer feature was just an experimental feature in Daffodil, so we reserved the right to change it.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is our hope that the new Layer API introduced by this commit will prove to be stable and supportable indefinitely.\r\n\r\nDAFFODIL-2845, DAFFODIL-2844, DAFFODIL-2825, DAFFODIL-2841,

PR is a bit of a monster with over 100 files touched. \r\n\r\nChanges are extensive enough since the prior \"3rd cut\" PR, that I decided to create a new PR, leaving that other one for reference for now. \r\n\r\nIt is now I believe/hope in fairly complete and clean shape, and rebased onto the latest.\r\n\r\nExtensive testing has been added. I'm curious what codecov says about the layer stuff now. \r\n\r\nThe rest of below is from the commit message\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the remaining issues open about Daffodil's Layers extension/plugins. Partial progress was in commit ff9ba4. This finishes that work.\r\n\r\n- DAFFODIL-2845 - Layer Improvements (umbrella ticket)\r\n- DAFFODIL-2844 - LayerNotEnoughDataException ...\r\n- DAFFODIL-2825 - Define Supported Layering API\r\n- DAFFODIL-2841 - Layers do not support created SDE or PE/UE Errors\r\n- DAFFODIL-2843 - How to create PE/UE from a layer\r\n\r\nThe layer API is all defined in Java clases and interfaces now.  One of the built-in layers (Gzip) is written in Java now.\r\n\r\nThere is only one layer property now: dfdlx:layer which takes a QName of the layer class.\r\n\r\nLayer classes are derived from\r\n\r\n    org.apache.daffodil.runtime1.layers.api.Layer\r\n\r\nA layer a name and target namespace, and hence a QName is required to identify it. This namespace is OWNED by the layer. All DFDL variables defined in that namespace are either used to pass parameters to the layer code, or receive results (such as a checksum) back from the layer code. This is enforced. A layer that has no DFDL variables does not have to define a DFDL schema that defines the layer's target namespace, but any layer that uses DFDL variables *must* define a schema with the layer's namespace as its target namespace, with the variables declared in it (using dfdl:defineVariable).\r\n\r\nThere is also an abstract base class for defining checksum layers called,\r\n\r\n    org.apache.daffodil.runtime1.layers.api.ChecksumLayer\r\n\r\nAll the layer properties about layer length kinds etc. are gone.\r\n\r\ndfdlx:layerLengthKind='boundaryMark' and dfdlx:boundaryMark properties are replaced by a layer named 'boundaryMark'.\r\n\r\ndfdlx:layerLengthKind='explicit' and dfdlx:layerLength properties are replaced by a layer named 'fixedLength'.\r\n\r\ndfdlx:layerLengthKind='implicit' is replaced by just not using one of the two above layers.\r\n\r\ndfdlx:layerTransform is replaced by just dfdlx:layer and is now a QName.  Layers no longer have both transformers and length-limiters mixed together.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to do explicit layer limiting, that differ in an important way.\r\n\r\nIf you use 'implicit' layer length (no restriction layer), and constrain the layer length by a surrounding element of specified length, then the layer length is controlled when parsing, but NOT controlled when unparsing.\r\n\r\nIf you use the layer \"fixedLength\", that dictates the parse and unparse length to be the value of the layerLength variable. Similarly if you use a checksum layer built with the ChecksumLayer base class, the length is controlled for both parsing and unparsing as it works like the fixedLength layer.\r\n\r\nLayer Variables:\r\n\r\nEach variable is either a parameter passed to a special setter named setLayerVariableParameters, or is a return variable which is populated from a special getter. The special setter args and getters taken together must use up all the DFDL variables defined in the layer's namespace. (See the javadoc for the Layer base class.)\r\n\r\nA special getter example might be:\r\n\r\n   int getLayerVariableResult_checksum() { .... }\r\n\r\nThis corresponds to, and returns the value that populates, the DFDL variable named 'checksum' in the layer's namespace. That DFDL variable must have a DFDL type corresponding to the int type (xs:unsignedShort or xs:int).\r\n\r\nLayers could have multiple result variables, but we have no actual examples of more than one value being returned.  (Returning multiple variables is tested. We just have no real use cases for it at this time.)\r\n\r\nAdditional Fixes in this Commit:\r\n\r\nFixed gzip layer which was not constructing on Java 17 or 21 due to static initializer differences of some sort.\r\n\r\nRemoved restriction that a layer can only have a single term inside it.\r\n\r\nAdded close() to InputSourceDataInputStream, as we weren't closing these.\r\n\r\nThere are a large number of simplifications in the \"layering\" of the various layer-related implementation classes.\r\n\r\nLayerRegistry is gone, merged into LayerFactory, which is gone, merged into LayerDriver.\r\n\r\nIn the examples/tests for layering: Changed check digit bad digit style to construct an always-invalid element instead of an assertion failure.\r\n\r\nAbout Testing:\r\n\r\nThe testing is quite extensive now. There are tests for every way that a user can goof up the definition of a layer class, and there are tests for processingError, runtimeSchemaDefinitionError, and throwing an Exception from every place a user-defined Layer could cause these. Parse errors cause backtracking in all sensible cases. Nothing aborts.\r\n\r\nProtecting every place that layer code is called from any sort of error/throw requires quite a number of try/catch blocks. This may have performance implications.\r\n\r\nDEPRECATION/COMPATABILITY\r\n\r\nThis new Layer API is 100% incompatible with schemas or layer code from Daffodil 3.6.0 and all prior versions of Daffodil. The layer feature was just an experimental feature in Daffodil, so we reserved the right to change it.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is our hope that the new Layer API introduced by this commit will prove to be stable and supportable indefinitely.\r\n\r\nDAFFODIL-2845, DAFFODIL-2844, DAFFODIL-2825, DAFFODIL-2841,

new tunable call invalidRestrictionPolicy is added to control how Daffodil handles restrictions that are not allowed by DFDL. This has values of \"error\", \"ignore\", \"validate, which tell Daffodil to SDE (current behavior), allow but do not use the restriction for validation, or allow and use it for validation, respecitvely.\r\n\r\nThis tunable currently only affects the xs:pattern restriction on non-string types. This allows extra validation capabilities using just XML Schema that would otherwise require a different validation mechanism like schematron.\r\n\r\nNote that Daffodil's pattern validation implementation already works for non-string types, so relatively few changes are needed to support the \"validation\" option. The only real change is to move the logic related to this new tunable into the Restriction class, since the patternValues variable in that class is what the SimpleTypeRuntimeData uses for validation.\r\n\r\nDAFFODIL-2877","created_at":"2024-03-15T12:33:43Z","updated_at":"2024-03-18T17:29:38Z","closed_at":"2024-03-18T17:29:35Z","merged_at":"2024-03-18T17:29:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"77d61900715034c9b09c73e93e9bedfc16d81438","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/pulls/1185/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/pulls/1185/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/1185/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/statuses/0d06d680bc62dc2eda6e7c21c0f8b25ad8b6b1e2","head":{"label":"stevedlawrence:daffodil-2877-invalid-restriction-policy","ref":"daffodil-2877-invalid-restriction-policy","sha":"0d06d680bc62dc2eda6e7c21c0f8b25ad8b6b1e2","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108402545,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDg0MDI1NDU=","name":"daffodil","full_name":"stevedlawrence/daffodil","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence/daffodil","description":"Apache

allows use of the deprecated separatorPolicy property and internally maps it to the new separatorSuppressionPolicy property. Unfortunately, according to the OGF Errata document our mapping is wrong, which means suppressedAtEndLax behaves like trailingEmptyStrict and suppressedAtEndStrict behaves like trailingEmpty. This is reversed from how it should be. This fixes that mapping so they have the correct behavior.\r\n\r\nDeprecation/Compatibility:\r\n\r\nThe deprecated separatorPolicy property values of \"suppressedAtEndLax\" and \"suppressedAtEndStrict\" had incorrect behaviors, with each property behaving like the other. Schemas using one value should be updated to use the other. Alternatively, schemas should be updated to use the new separatorSuppressionPolicy property with the following mappings from the deprecated property:\r\n\r\n* required -> never\r\n* suppressed ->

and optional elements are both implemented in the infoset exactly the same as DIElements, the only real difference is optional elements might not appear in the infoset. Arrays on the other hand are implemented differently as a DIArray. Because of this, it adds complexity if we allow expression path steps that can ambiguously reference either an array or an optional. We currently allow this, but this complexity leads to bugs and thrown exceptions.\r\n\r\nIn fact, in most cases ambiguously referencing an array or an optional doesn't even work since arrays need a predicate and optionals do not allow predicates. The only case it could potentially work is as the last step as an argument to a function like fn:count. The added complexity is not worth supporting this edge case.\r\n\r\nInstead of allowing this, we should instead only allow ambiguous paths steps to scalar and optional elements. This modifies the path step logic to enforce this. A step must now unambiguously reference an array or it must reference scalars/optionals.\r\n\r\nNote that this slightly affects the behavior of the fn:count() function. This function must still reference an array or optional as before, but it can now reference a scalar only if it is an ambiguous path that could also reference an optional. If the argument unambiguously references a scalar, it is an SDE as it was before. It can also no longer ambiguously reference an array or optional, but that was previously broken.\r\n\r\nDAFFODIL-2879","created_at":"2024-03-12T18:55:36Z","updated_at":"2024-03-14T12:20:08Z","closed_at":"2024-03-14T12:20:05Z","merged_at":"2024-03-14T12:20:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"3f897fe62b7946870290d7414ee27d5b733426b1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/pulls/1180/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/pulls/1180/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/1180/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/statuses/e08ee67ad169bff8360b51b0810b78f07b1329e5","head":{"label":"stevedlawrence:daffodil-2879-array-optional-ambiguous-path-step","ref":"daffodil-2879-array-optional-ambiguous-path-step","sha":"e08ee67ad169bff8360b51b0810b78f07b1329e5","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108402545,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDg0MDI1NDU=","name":"daffodil","full_name":"stevedlawrence/daffodil","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence/daffodil","description":"Apache

API is all defined in Java clases and interfaces now.\r\n\r\nReworked to use DFDL variables for all\r\ncommunications into the layer code.\r\n\r\nSplit layers so that layer limiting is its own layer (for boundary mark and there is also a fixedLength layer).\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to do explicit layer limiting, that differ in an important way.\r\n\r\nIf you use 'implicit' layer length (no restriction layer), and constraint the layer length by a surrounding element of specified length, then the layer length is controlled when parsing, but NOT controlled when unparsing.\r\n\r\nIf you use the layer \"fixedLength\", that dictates the parse and unparse length to be the value of the layerLength variable. Similarly if you use a checksum layer built with the ChecksumLayer base class, the length is controlled for both parsing and unparsing.\r\n\r\nDAFFODIL-2845","created_at":"2024-02-27T23:53:34Z","updated_at":"2024-03-02T00:44:00Z","closed_at":"2024-03-02T00:44:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7fb6b373b5942d10574b7e268aedcf69597367fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/pulls/1170/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/pulls/1170/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/1170/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/statuses/1b9e865a7831bb9b0492d9b10f83e15d168a3ef3","head":{"label":"mbeckerle:daf-2845-layers","ref":"daf-2845-layers","sha":"1b9e865a7831bb9b0492d9b10f83e15d168a3ef3","user":{"login":"mbeckerle","id":1524099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1524099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle","html_url":"https://github.com/mbeckerle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108433914,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDg0MzM5MTQ=","name":"daffodil","full_name":"mbeckerle/daffodil","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mbeckerle","id":1524099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1524099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle","html_url":"https://github.com/mbeckerle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbeckerle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mbeckerle/daffodil","description":"Mirror

ExpectIt fails to find a match in CLI tests, it adds the input buffer that scanned in the exception object it throws.

XMLTextInfosetOutputter and JSONInfosetOutputter do not use any buffering when writing data. Modifying these to wrap a BufferedWriter around the existing OutputStreamWriter gives significant performance improvements. Using a BufferedWriter also allows us to use its built-in newLine() function for pretty printing.\r\n\r\nThis also modifies the \"Standard\" XML escape style in the xml infoset outputter so that it first checks if there are any characters that need to be escaped, similar to what we do for CDATA escape style. In most cases, there will not be any characters that need escaping, so we can avoid Scala XML's escape utility, which has noticeable overhead, even if nothing needs escaping.\r\n\r\nWith these changes tested on a large file with lots of strings, this saw total parse + infoset output time drop from about 125 seconds to 93 seconds, about a 25% decrease. Note that parsing with the null infoset outputter takes about 78 seconds, so the xml infoset outputter overhead went from about 37% of the total parse time down to about 20%.\r\n\r\nDAFFODIL-2872","created_at":"2024-02-15T20:29:10Z","updated_at":"2024-02-19T23:08:21Z","closed_at":"2024-02-19T23:08:18Z","merged_at":"2024-02-19T23:08:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"37fa52e2efed11d4fa272a2f61c47e42302cc6ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/pulls/1159/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/pulls/1159/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/1159/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/statuses/8c9d43db019f49e4a05dacc28f21eefd24e62885","head":{"label":"stevedlawrence:daffodil-2872-infoset-outputter-performance","ref":"daffodil-2872-infoset-outputter-performance","sha":"8c9d43db019f49e4a05dacc28f21eefd24e62885","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108402545,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDg0MDI1NDU=","name":"daffodil","full_name":"stevedlawrence/daffodil","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence/daffodil","description":"Apache

the <a href=\"https://docs.codecov.com/docs/the-codecov-cli\">CLI</a> as the underlying upload. The CLI has helped to power new features including local upload, the global upload token, and new upcoming features.</p>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The Codecov Action runs as a <code>node20</code> action due to <code>node16</code> deprecation. See <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2023-09-22-github-actions-transitioning-from-node-16-to-node-20/\">this post from GitHub</a> on how to migrate.</li>\n<li>Tokenless uploading is unsupported. However, PRs made from forks to the upstream public repos will support tokenless (e.g. contributors to OS projects do not need the upstream repo's Codecov token). This <a href=\"https://docs.codecov.com/docs/adding-the-codecov-token#github-actions\">doc</a> shows instructions on how to add the Codecov token.</li>\n<li>OS platforms have been added, though some may not be automatically detected. To see a list of platforms, see our <a href=\"https://cli.codecov.io\">CLI download page</a></li>\n<li>Various arguments to the Action have been changed. Please be aware that the arguments match with the CLI's needs</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>v3</code> versions and below will not have access to CLI features (e.g. global upload token, ATS).</p>\n<h2>What's

[codecov/codecov-action](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action) from 3.1.4 to 4.0.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action/releases\">codecov/codecov-action's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v4.0.0</h2>\n<p>v4 of the Codecov Action uses the <a href=\"https://docs.codecov.com/docs/the-codecov-cli\">CLI</a> as the underlying upload. The CLI has helped to power new features including local upload, the global upload token, and new upcoming features.</p>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The Codecov Action runs as a <code>node20</code> action due to <code>node16</code> deprecation. See <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2023-09-22-github-actions-transitioning-from-node-16-to-node-20/\">this post from GitHub</a> on how to migrate.</li>\n<li>Tokenless uploading is unsupported. However, PRs made from forks to the upstream public repos will support tokenless (e.g. contributors to OS projects do not need the upstream repo's Codecov token). This <a href=\"https://docs.codecov.com/docs/adding-the-codecov-token#github-actions\">doc</a> shows instructions on how to add the Codecov token.</li>\n<li>OS platforms have been added, though some may not be automatically detected. To see a list of platforms, see our <a href=\"https://cli.codecov.io\">CLI download page</a></li>\n<li>Various arguments to the Action have been changed. Please be aware that the arguments match with the CLI's needs</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>v3</code> versions and below will not have access to CLI features (e.g. global upload token, ATS).</p>\n<h2>What's

[!NOTE]\r\n> This is an alternative approach to #1138, which does feel like a bit of a hack and does not support other padding styles. Like that one, I've marked this as an RFC/Draft since it uses behavior not specified by the DFDL specification and gives meaning to something ICU normally ignores.\r\n>\r\n> In the previous PR, there was some discussion about making the negative pattern mean something more. Although DAFFODIL-2870 suggests we shouldn't do that, I think this use is small enough that it is potentially acceptable. It also doesn't require changes to Daffodil parsing/unparsing (with possible performance implications) or extension properties mentioned in the other PR (e.g. `dfdlx:textNumberPositivePatttern`/`dfdlx:textNumberNegativePattern`/`dfdlx:icuPadPosition`). We definitely do need to be careful about what, if any, meaning we extract from normally ignored parts of the negative pattern, but the pad position seems like a reasonable exception to me considering possible ambiguities with the positive pattern.  \r\n\r\nICU only uses the positive pattern of the textNumberPattern property to determine pad character and position, completely ignoring the negative pattern. If the positive pattern has no affix associated with the pad character, then there is an ambiguity if the pad character should appear before or after the negative affix when unparsing negative numbers. In this case, ICU defaults to before the affix, with no way to change it via the pattern. This effectively means it is not possible for ICU number padding to appear after a negative affix if there is no positive affix.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this ambiguity and allow configuring where pad characters appear, we inspect the negative pattern. If both negative and positive patterns define padding on the same affix, and the positive pattern has an empty string for that affix, then we use the pad position from the negative pattern. In all other cases, the pad character in the negative pattern is ignored following usual ICU behavior.\r\n\r\nFor example, a textNumberPattern of \"*0####0;-*00\" formats a negative number with zero

[!NOTE]\r\n> I've marked this as a RFC/Draft--although I think this changes the behavior to what a user would expect with this specific type of textNumberPattern, it is behavior that is not specified by the DFDL specification\r\n\r\nIf textNumberPattern specifies a pad character before the number pattern and without a positive prefix, then ICU defaults to a pad position of PAD_BEFORE_PREFIX with no way to change it with just the pattern. This is reasonable for most cases, like when the pad character is a space. However, if the pad character in textNumberPattern is '0', then negative numbers are padded with a '0' before the negative sign. For example, a pattern of \"*0####0\" unparses -123 to \"0-123\". This is very unlikely to be what the user wants with this pattern.\r\n\r\nSo in this very specific case, we change the pad position to PAD_AFTER_PREFIX so the zero pad character appears after the

current algorithm to remove right padding of left justified strings first reverses the String, removes leading pad characters using dropWhile, and then reverses the result. The two reverses are linear in the length of the String, and requires allocating multiple String instances and copying characters from one to the other. And this is done regardless of how many, if any, pad chars exist in the String. This logic is very clear, but is fairly inefficient, enough to show up while profiling.\r\n\r\nTo improve performance, this rewrites the algorithm to scan through the String in reverse to find the index of the last pad character and then uses the substring() function to create a new String with those pad characters removed. This is now linear in the number of pad characters in a String instead of the full length of the string. Additionally, the use of substring() avoids character copies, since it just allocates a new String using the same underlying String value but with different indices.\r\n\r\nI have not looked into detail how scala implements dropWhile() for Strings (skimming the code, it looks like it will allocate a new String and copy characters), but for consistency and maximum performance, this also updates the algorithm that removes left padding of right justified strings to use similar logic as the new right padding algorithm. By using substring() we should avoid possible copies.\r\n\r\nIn one test with lots of left justified strings, many of which are padded, this saw about a 15% improvement in parse times (excluding infoset creating using the null infoset outputter), and padding removal no longer shows up while profiling.\r\n\r\nDAFFODIL-2868","created_at":"2024-01-08T20:53:50Z","updated_at":"2024-01-09T14:43:44Z","closed_at":"2024-01-09T14:43:40Z","merged_at":"2024-01-09T14:43:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"f4996f0fe86643e9282d37a06263c3cc5a82de81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/pulls/1134/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/pulls/1134/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/1134/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/statuses/4f28f2ba214f5fd20abccbc7c7da3331ece48bd3","head":{"label":"stevedlawrence:daffodil-2868-performance-padding","ref":"daffodil-2868-performance-padding","sha":"4f28f2ba214f5fd20abccbc7c7da3331ece48bd3","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108402545,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDg0MDI1NDU=","name":"daffodil","full_name":"stevedlawrence/daffodil","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence/daffodil","description":"Apache

parsing text floats, ICU sometimes returns a BigInteger, such as the case when parsing the maximum single precision floating-point value (i.e. 3.40282347E+38).\r\n\r\nThe current logic for checking if these parsed BigIntegers are in range of a float is to convert it to a double and then compare that against the maximum value of a float (promoted to a double). However, converting a BigInteger to a double can lead to changes in precision, making this comparison inaccurate. Looking at bit representations makes this more clear:\r\n\r\nFloat.MaxValue.doubleValue converted to bits is:\r\n\r\n    0 10001111110 1111111111111111111111100000000000000000000000000000\r\n\r\nBut BigInteger(Float.MaxValue).doubleValue converted to bits is:\r\n\r\n    0 10001111110 1111111111111111111111100101010011011010111111111000\r\n\r\nThe rules for converting a float to a double are different than converting a BigInteger to a double, which leads to changes in precision and a double value that is slightly bigger than the actual float max value, leading to out of range errors.\r\n\r\nBecause converting a BigInteger to a double is unreliable, this adds a new case for BigInteger, which converts it to a BigDecimal and compares that against the max value, which avoids precision issues. Note that this also changes the min/maxBD values to be created from a string rather than a double, since converting a double to a BigDecimal also has related precision issues.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when unparsing text floats, ICU does not have a way to unparse single precision floats. Instead, it converts the float to a double and then unparses that. However, this leads to text numbers with extra precision that implies more accuracy than exists for floats, and leads to errors with some round trip tests. To fix this, this converts the float to a BigDecimal using the String constructor (which maintains prcision), and then has ICU format the BigDecimal. This is more expensive, but leads to more correct text floats.\r\n\r\nDAFFODIL-2867","created_at":"2024-01-03T17:44:35Z","updated_at":"2024-01-04T14:20:50Z","closed_at":"2024-01-04T14:20:47Z","merged_at":"2024-01-04T14:20:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"20d6ea3479c85e431faa260424ecb5e2675d7d8c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/pulls/1133/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/pulls/1133/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/issues/1133/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/daffodil/statuses/62673746e9c3e26c8ba58095b557363175fd4f42","head":{"label":"stevedlawrence:daffodil-2867-float-comparison","ref":"daffodil-2867-float-comparison","sha":"62673746e9c3e26c8ba58095b557363175fd4f42","user":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108402545,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDg0MDI1NDU=","name":"daffodil","full_name":"stevedlawrence/daffodil","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stevedlawrence","id":3180601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODA2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3180601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence","html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevedlawrence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stevedlawrence/daffodil","description":"Apache

the basis that a little support is better than none, allow codegen-c to generate C code for a limited subset of dfdl:assert expressions.  The use case is to allow generated code to validate or reject messages using dfdl:assert expressions as well as ranges and enumerations.  The dfdl:assert support is limited to replacing \"../foo/x\" and \".\"  with the appropriate pointers and replacing DFDL named operators (\"eq\") with C-compatible operators (\"==\") using find and replace operators.  In the long term, a better approach would be to add methods to the compiled expression classes to generate C code directly from the compiled expressions with fuller understanding of what the parts of the expressions represent.\r\n\r\nDAFFODIL-2865\r\n\r\nerrors.[ch]: Add new ERR_DFDL_ASSERT error code for assertion expressions which fail.\r\n\r\nvalidators.[ch]: Add new validate_dfdl_assert function for checking assertion expressions.  Handle both recoverableError and processingError failure types appropriately.\r\n\r\nDaffodilCCodeGenerator.scala: Call AssertStatementGenerateCode to generate C code for assertion expressions in both empty sequences and simple elements.\r\n\r\nAssertStatementGenerateCode.scala: Generate C code for two types of assertion expressions: \"{ ../../foo/x eq 2 }\" as used in empty sequences and \"{ . eq 2 }\" as used in simple elements.  Anything else likely won't produce valid C code at this time.\r\n\r\nCodeGeneratorState.scala: Make the cExpression function find and replace even more DFDL named operators with C-compatible operators.\r\n\r\nNestedUnion/generated_code.c: Regenerate to show new C code for assertion expressions in simple elements.\r\n\r\ndata/nested.struct.{diag{1,2},err{1,2}}.dat: Add new data files which
