Description\r\nDruid has Kafka and kinesis ingestions. RocketMQ is a message queue which is similar to Kafka. We have created SeekableStreamSupervisor interface to server this type of message queue. I implement a RocketMQ ingestion follow this model. Message offset in specify broker and queue is in order, so I use broker+queueID as partition. I've test it on my MAC and it works for creating/suspending/resuming supervisor and publishing segments. I'll add unit tests and document for it later. \r\nIt's type is rocketmq and IOconfig will like this:\r\n```\r\n    \"ioConfig\": {\r\n      \"topic\": \"some-topic\",\r\n      \"consumerProperties\": {\r\n        \"nameserver.url\": \"name server address\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"stream\": \"some-topic\"\r\n       ...\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

attempt at making travis be a bit more selective about what it runs, since every change takes like.. over a day of compute time. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new script, `check-test-suite.py`, which is used in `.travis.yml` jobs to check whether or not a given job should run. It does this based on an admittedly primitive git diff file path prefix matching against stuff hard coded into the script, initially dividing into 3 categories: 'docs', 'web-console' and like, everything else. We do some similar stuff for code coverage diff checking enforcement for java projects, so a follow-up improvement could provide finer granularity for the 'everything else' bucket.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there is a better way to configure this than hard coding stuff into the script as well, but, its a start and should let us at least cut down a tiny amount of the global warming we are surely causing with all of this CI.\r\n\r\nI think the only thing that is questionable is considering changes to `.travis.yml` skippable, which will result in newly added configurations of existing tests not getting triggered I think, but maybe that isn't a common situation? Also, I have the license checks and packaging checks running always, because they seem like useful sanity checks to make sure all license stuff is cool and that a distribution can be built from source.","created_at":"2021-05-12T06:29:19Z","updated_at":"2021-12-07T19:35:44Z","closed_at":"2021-05-21T08:33:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cea1adb556c75a7625d487afde18efb3b28fbcd9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":303259531,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDMyNTk1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Testing","name":"Area

Description\r\nThis PR fixes array handling with JDBC connections, which was missing the translation of these array types into the JDBC metadata, as well as the implicit array to JSON string conversion we were doing is not suitable for this use, since avatica translates them into `java.sql.Array`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also splits up the SQL array functions (prefixed `ARRAY_`) from multi value string functions (prefix `MV_`) to allow for subtly different return type reporting and handling (the primary difference being that `MV_` functions which return arrays will typically report their output type as `VARCHAR` instead of an `ARRAY`). I've also homogenized the type signatures of these functions to make sure all of the `ARRAY_` and `MV_` functions are consistent within the family (some of the ARRAY_ methods were missing handling actual ARRAY typed inputs heh).\r\n\r\nTo go along with this split, I also split the multi-value string and array unit tests into their own test files, since `CalciteQueryTest` is a monster, as well as adding a few additional tests, which also uncovered a bug in string array to numeric array conversion with null values.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

(https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3677) and audit logs auto cleanup (https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/11084). This PR adds a similar auto cleanup but for the compaction configurations (which are stored in the druid config table) to auto clean up compaction configs belonging to datasource that is no longer active -- meaning that the datasource has no used/unused segments.\r\n\r\nThis is useful when Druid user has a high churn of task / datasource in a short amount of time causing the metadata store size to grow uncontrollably. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR fixes a bug in the data loader flow when connecting Kinesis.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the `Endpoint` field looks like it is filled in with the default value but it also is `required` so it requires input.\r\nThe issue is fixed as a one line change in `ingestion-spec.tsx` per the docs the `endpoint` field is not required.\r\n\r\nIn addition to fixing this issue:\r\n\r\n- AutoForm has been upgraded so that `defaultValue` is ignored when `required` is evaluated to true\r\n- Tests have been greatly expanded\r\n- I scanned the code for more instances of this issue and found one in the `TIMESTAMP_SPEC_FIELDS`\r\n- Added the ability to Alt+Shift+Click a tile in the ingestion screen to go to its connection step even if the extension is not loaded.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

feature to automatically remove datasource metadata based on retention period\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe currently already have tasklog auto cleanup (https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3677) and audit logs auto cleanup (https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/11084). This PR adds a similar auto cleanup based on duration (time to retained) but for the datasource metadata table to auto clean up datasource that is no longer active -- meaning that the datasource does not have active supervisor running (Note: datasource metadata only exists for datasource created from supervisor).\r\n\r\nThis is useful when Druid user has a high churn of task / datasource in a short amount of time causing the metadata store size to grow uncontrollably. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

#7030 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nImplements an indexing service extension for reading from Apache Pulsar.\r\n\r\nAddtionally includes an implementation of `AvroBytesDecoder` that takes advantage of passing through `PulsarRecordEntity` to extract schema information such that messages can be automatically decoded into Avro `GenericRecord` types.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `PulsarSchemaRegistryAvroBytesDecoder`\r\n * `PulsarSupervisor`\r\n * `PulsarIndexTask`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency

Description\r\n\r\nDruid has Kafka and kinesis ingestions. Pulsar is a message queue which is similar to Kafka. We have created SeekableStreamSupervisor interface to server this type of message queue. I implement a Pulsar ingestion follow this model. This ingestion use Pulsar message ID as sequence number and use exclusive consume mode which can ordered consume message from Pulsar. I've test it on my MAC and it works for creating/suspending/resuming supervisor and publishing segments. I'll add unit tests and document for it later. \r\nIt's type is pulsar and IOconfig will like this:\r\n```\r\n    \"ioConfig\": {\r\n      \"topic\": \"persistent://public/default/some-topic\",\r\n      \"consumerProperties\": {\r\n        \"pulsar.url\": \"pulsar://pulsar-address\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"stream\": \"persistent://public/default/some-topic\"\r\n       ...\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

5191680.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/2df42143aec6c50e9ac31d89cd75749d10d37a3d/core/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/java/util/emitter/core/BaseHttpEmittingConfig.java#L63\r\n\r\nI checked the history of code, `BaseHttpEmittingConfig` class was first shipped by com.metamx:emitter. In the [earliest package](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/metamx/emitter/)(0.3.0) I could find , the default value of max batch size is defined as 5 * 1024 * 1024. From this clue, we can infer that the value in code is right.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the default value in the doc to keep it accordance with the code and also uses the standard binary prefix `MiB` instead of the decimal format `MB` to make the description accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been

Description\r\nThis PR adds some improvements and fixes to the query processing system, mostly related to expression planning and execution. `ExpressionPlan` has been reworked to now produce the `ColumnCapabilities` directly instead of `ExpressionVirtualColumn` doing this from the plan, which keeps everything a bit tighter together and much actual logic out of being in `ExpressionVirtualColumn`. The `ExpressionPlanner` was relatively well covered by tests prior to this PR, but it was almost entirely indirect coverage from the set of queries we were running, and had no direct tests. I've changed this added quite a few tests to model various scenarios that can occur when planning expressions against an underlying `ColumnInspector` so hopefully things will be better defined.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason for reworking this stuff is so that single input strings can correctly report themselves as dictionary encoded to allow for deferring expression evaluation until the time `lookupName` is called, an optimization that had not yet made its way to the vectorized expression processing, but is available now through `SingleStringDeferredEvaluationExpressionDimensionVectorSelector`. This deferred evaluation offers quite a performance improvement, allowing using the native string grouping strategy and lazily executing expression on value lookup, instead of eagerly evaluating them and using the dictionary building grouping strategy.\r\n\r\nGiven the queries:\r\n```\r\n      // 28: group by single input string low cardinality expr with expr agg\r\n      \"SELECT CONCAT(string2, '-', 'foo'), SUM(long1 * long4) FROM foo GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2\",\r\n      // 28: group by single input string high cardinality expr with expr agg\r\n      \"SELECT CONCAT(string3, '-', 'foo'), SUM(long1 * long4) FROM foo GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nnon-vectorized:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score    Error  Units\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       28           5000000        false  avgt    5  686.636 ± 22.514  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       29           5000000        false  avgt    5  852.508 ± 28.924  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\neager vector object selector/dictionary building grouping strategy (unoptimized previous behavior which ended up being slower than the optimized non-vectorized engine) :\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score     Error  Units\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       28           5000000        force  avgt    5  976.128 ±  78.928  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       29           5000000        force  avgt    5  960.815 ± 272.107  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nnew lazy evaluated expression grouping optimization for parity with non-vectorized engine using `Expr.eval`:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score     Error  Units\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       28           5000000        force  avgt    5  158.428 ±  6.382  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       29           5000000        force  avgt    5  194.414 ± 20.348  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nnew lazy evaluated expression grouping optimization for parity with non-vectorized engine using `ExprVectorProcessor.evalVector` with a vector size of 1:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score    Error  Units\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       28           5000000        force  avgt    5  155.643 ± 11.507  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       29           5000000        force  avgt    5  164.360 ±  8.924  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last one measured slightly better than using `Expr.eval`, so this PR went with using `ExprVectorProcessor` even though the vector size is only ever 1. I suspect this will often be the case since the vectorized expression processors are stronger typed and so can eliminate most branching required to process individual rows since it knows the types of everything ahead of time.\r\n\r\nThis optimization can only be used by single input strings, because it can delegate dictionary ids to use for grouping to the underlying column. String expressions with multiple input columns will still use the default vector object selector path.\r\n\r\nVector selector construction in `ColumnProcessors` has been adjusted to push the decision on whether or not to use dictionary encoded selectors or object selectors into the processor factory, and group by engine now takes a less aggressive stance that any dictionary encoded column should use a dictionary encoded selector, which means single input string expressions will now use the `SingleStringDeferredEvaluationExpressionDimensionVectorSelector` and group on the underlying dictionary ids, while aggregators or filters on virtual columns will still use the object selector, which should still be more performant in non-grouping cases where evaluation cannot be deferred.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes an unrelated issue with vector query engines not having access to virtual column capabilities when trying to determine when if they can vectorize, and solves it by introducing a `VirtualizedColumnInspector` which wraps another `ColumnInspector` and is now used in these engines instead of the direct segment adapter, fixing the issue described in this comment https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/11188#discussion_r624833355\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes a regression I believed was caused by #10135, which refactored the `AVG` and `COUNT` `SqlAggregator` implementations to directly construct the `FilteredAggregatorFactory` instead of [using `Aggregation.create(...).filter(...)`](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10135/files#diff-8816fcddac6763b07323c31d729ba5c3991c1fb902b74999b3f3385e407431a5L120), which caused any virtual columns which were created by the filter to no longer be associated with the `Aggregation` and so [not retained when the final query was constructed](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/sql/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/sql/calcite/rel/DruidQuery.java#L639), effectively making these aggregators process nil inputs instead of the correct values.\r\n\r\nWhile looking into this issue, I noticed that `FilteredAggregatorFactory.requiredFields` did not include the required columns of the `DimFilter`, but only of the delegate `AggregatorFactory`. This seemed a mistake to me so I have adjusted this so that it will now return the correct set of columns, and am using this, along with a new method on `VirtualColumnRegistry` which can filter a list of columns to only include columns which are virtual so that we can continue to populate the `Aggregation` virtual columns list.\r\n\r\n~~I think we can rework `Aggregation` to not require having this list of `VirtualColumn` at all and instead just check the registry against `requiredFields` when constructing the query, but it was a more disruptive change than I wanted to tie up in this fix, so I will save it for a follow-up.~~\r\n\r\nSince this manual tracking of virtual columns is error prone, I have reworked `Aggregation` to no longer track `VirtualColumn` at all, and instead added a new `getRequiredColumns` method which is a composite `AggregatorFactory.requiredFields` for all agg factories and `PostAggregator.dependentFields`. This new `Aggregation.getRequiredColumns` method is intended to bebe used as input to the new `VirtualColumnRegistry.findVirtualColumns` method to help filter the final set of virtual columns to include on the query.\r\n\r\nI have also reworked various `SqlAggregator` implementations to just find fields directly from the registry instead of using the list supplied by the `Aggregation`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests

#10542\r\n\r\n#10669 introduced the travis build that does data ingestion and querying on a zookeeper-less cluster using kubernetes druid extention. this patch adds another build that stress tests the

java client dependency version is also updated to pull changes related to leader election improvements so that graceful coordinator/overlord shutdown immediately gives up leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis

on the concept from #11172 and adds a way to feed HLL sketches\r\nwith UTF-8 bytes.\r\n\r\nThis must be an option rather than always-on, because prior to this\r\npatch, HLL sketches used UTF-16LE encoding when hashing strings. To\r\nremain compatible with sketch images created prior to this patch -- which\r\nmatters during rolling updates and when reading sketches that have been\r\nwritten to segments -- we must keep UTF-16LE as the default.\r\n\r\nNot currently documented, because I'm not yet sure how best to expose\r\nthis functionality to users. I think the first place would be in the SQL\r\nlayer: we could have it automatically select UTF-8 or UTF-16LE when\r\nbuilding sketches at query time. We need to be careful about this, though,\r\nbecause UTF-8 isn't always faster. Sometimes, like for the results of\r\nexpressions, UTF-16LE is faster. I expect we will sort this out in\r\nfuture patches.\r\n\r\nTo enable experimentation, I added a currently-undocumented SQL\r\naggregator, `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_DS_HLL_UTF8`. Hopefully\r\nwe will be able to fold this in to `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_DS_HLL`\r\nin a way that is safe for users.\r\n\r\n**Benchmarks**\r\n\r\nThese are benchmarks of various approx count distinct functions on a 5,000,000 row segment.

This PR adds a similar auto cleanup based on duration (time to retained) but for the supervisor table to auto clean up terminated supervisors\r\n\r\nThis is useful when Druid user has a high churn of task / datasource in a short amount of time causing the metadata store size to grow uncontrollably. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x]

Tasks, both auto and manual, try to acquire locks on the Datasource Intervals which they need to compact. If a higher priority ingestion task is in progress for an overlapping interval, the compaction task waits until it can acquire a lock. This can lead to the following potential issues:\r\n- Due to poor configuration of `skipOffsetFromLatest`, compaction can get stuck for long periods of time.\r\n- Once the lock is released by the ingestion task, it is possible that some new segments are published (and/or removed). This invalidates the segment spec in the compaction task, causing it to fail. Such failures are unnecessary and often difficult to debug.\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\nRather than waiting on already locked intervals, we can proceed to the compaction of other intervals (these would be older intervals, if the compaction policy is Newest First). When the locked intervals are freed up, subsequent compaction runs can submit compaction tasks for them.\r\n\r\nIn every compaction run (invocation of`CompactSegments.run()`)\r\n- the Coordinator makes a call to the Overlord API `/lockedIntervals`\r\n- the Overlord returns a list of intervals locked by each currently running task, using the \r\n  in-memory state of the `TaskLockbox`\r\n - the Coordinator then skips the locked intervals while submitting compaction tasks\r\n - For simplicity, Segment Locks are treated the same as Time Chunk Locks i.e. if a Segment in an interval\r\n is locked by a higher priority, the whole interval is skipped while submitting compaction tasks\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Changes:\r\n * Add Overlord REST endpoint `/druid/indexer/v1/lockedIntervals`\r\n * Use the above API in `CompactSegments.run()` to skip locked intervals\r\n * Add config `druid.coordinator.compaction.skipLockedIntervals` with default value as true\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nMost internal APIs used in Druid's ingestion should be idempotent to handle transient errors. This PR fixes the idempotence of two APIs used in native batch ingestion.\r\n\r\nThe first API is the segment allocation API used in dynamic partitioning. Currently, transient network errors or task failures can lead to non-contiguous segment partitionIds allocated by this API. This can be a problem because `PartitionHolder` of those segments of non-contiguous partitionIds will be never complete in the broker timeline. As a result, everything will look fine, that means, the task will succeed, segments will be published into the metadata store, historicals will load and announce them, but you will never be able to query them.\r\n\r\nTo fix the segment allocation API, I had to add a new API that accepts extra parameters such as `sequenceName` to guarantee the idempotence. This will break the rolling upgrade that replaces idle nodes with a newer version one at a time. To resolve this issue, I added a taskContext, `useLineageBasedSegmentAllocation`, to control which protocol to use for segment allocation in dynamic partitioning. This option is true by default and must be set to false during rolling upgrade. The in-place rolling upgrade is not a consideration because batch ingestion doesn't support it.\r\n\r\nThe second API is the task report API used in all native batch ingestion types. This API can handle retries triggered by transient network errors, but cannot handle duplicate reports by task retries. As a result, if there is a task that failed after sending its report, the supervisor task will count both the report of the failed task and that of the retry task. Because of this bug, the parallel task can incorrectly estimate the cardinality of partition column and the distribution of partition column in hash and range partitioning, respectively.\r\n\r\nFinally, to test the fix, I added random task failures and API call retries (emulating transient network failures) in `AbstractParallelIndexSupervisorTaskTest`. All unit tests extending this class, such as `CompactionTaskParallelRunTest`, `HashPartitionMultiPhaseParallelIndexingTest`, `SinglePhaseParallelIndexingTest`, and `RangePartitionMultiPhaseParallelIndexingTest`, now run with potential transient task failures and API call retries.\r\n\r\nUpgrade path to 0.22:\r\n\r\n- If you upgrade data nodes first as recommended in https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/operations/rolling-updates.html#rolling-restart-restore-based, there are nothing to do. All batch tasks with dynamic partitioning should succeed during the replacing rolling upgrade.\r\n- If you upgrade overlord before middleManagers, you must set `druid.indexer.task.default.context = { \"useLineageBasedSegmentAllocation\": false }` during the upgrade, and restore it to `{ \"useLineageBasedSegmentAllocation\": true }` after the upgrade is finished.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SinglePhaseParallelIndexTaskRunner`\r\n * `TaskMonitor`\r\n * `AbstractParallelIndexSupervisorTaskTest`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

#11145 (maybe others since this has been an issue for quite a while now, but I couldn't find any while searching)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR modifies the Druid SQL planner to no longer skip empty buckets when it generates a timeseries query with 'all' granularity, which should produce query result behavior that is more SQL compatible. \r\n\r\nIn SQL when running a query with only aggregators, such as `SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(x) FROM y WHERE z = 'someval'`, then the aggregation is done as if there is a single universal grouping key, and so this example query should return something even if there are no values which match `'someval'`, and should produce `[0, null]` in this case. \r\n\r\nWe plan queries like this example into a Druid native timeseries query, and prior to this patch would always set `skipEmptyBuckets` query context parameter to 'true', because a timeseries query with a granularity other than 'ALL' is equivalent to grouping by a time floor expression, so empty results should be removed in this case. But when using 'ALL' granularity, such as we do in the example query when there is no time floor expression to be grouping on, this setting isn't appropriate, because it makes druid return empty results, instead of the initialized aggregators for the universal group like it correctly should.\r\n\r\nI ran into this issue again when trying to write test for #11157 to test that something like `SELECT ARRAY_AGG(x) FROM y WHERE z = 'missing value'` produces a single `[null]` result, but then remembered that I couldn't write that test because of this issue 😅 .\r\n\r\nThe actual changes are small, ~5 lines in `DruidQuery` when constructing a timeseries query to check if 'ALL' granularity before setting 'skipEmptyBuckets' context parameter, everything else is test changes.\r\n\r\nI went through and added tests for I think almost all of our SQL aggregator functions to capture their current outputs in both default mode and SQL compatible null handling mode for this empty timeseries result case, and got a bit carried away refactoring these tests to be simplified and extend `BaseCalciteQueryTest` which is why the PR is sort of large (but is a nice improvement for all of these SQL tests).\r\n\r\nI'm not actually sure all of these aggregator functions behave correctly, notably some of the quantiles sketches which return `Double.NaN` in both modes, and some other sketches which return an empty sketch in both modes, but I'll save changing the behavior of any of these aggregators for another day.\r\n\r\nSince this changes the default behavior of query results in that SQL queries which plan to timeseries queries with ALL granularity will now always produce a single result row instead of nothing. The old behavior can be retained by explicitly setting `skipEmptyBuckets` to true, which will overrule the planner behavior.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n*

Description\r\nThis PR adjusts the heap based topN algorithm to only use known the \"known\" cardinality path only when the dictionary contains unique values. The known cardinality path to aggregate values uses an array based approach, where an array of aggregator arrays the size of the value cardinality is created, and the dictionaryId is expected to index to an array position with the aggregators for that value, as an optimization to avoid a map lookup. \r\n\r\nHowever, when a selector is aggregated which does not have unique dictionaryIds, but does know its cardinality, such as a selector from an `IndexedTable` from a join result which uses the row number as the dictionaryId instead, it means that each dictionaryId will be 'new', and thus have a null array entry and still incur the map interaction this path is trying to avoid.\r\n\r\nInstead, these selectors will now just use the map directly by using the cardinality \"unknown\" path instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-30T12:55:13Z","updated_at":"2021-08-12T09:14:54Z","closed_at":"2021-06-10T23:32:22Z","merged_at":"2021-06-10T23:32:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"6b272c857f14a79eceefd1ee24957332a49abef5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

#8970 (well it was already fixed somewhere along the way, but fixes another issue discovered in the comments)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue when using expression virtual columns that reference string values on realtime query segments, where an automatic transform to handle possible multi-valued string inputs forces array output from the selector, which the aggregators are not prepared to handle. See https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8970#issuecomment-829762963 for details.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a modification that fixes the side-effect of these transformations, to allow array typed `ExprEval` to provide scalar values if and only if the array has a single element. Otherwise it will retain its current behavior where methods like `getLong` and `getDouble` return default zero values. This changes makes array expression results mirror the the behavior of scalar expression results, where scalar expressions are currently allowed to present themselves as single element arrays (which exists to handle cases where array functions are used and the input value is a string column is multi-valued in one segment, but single valued in another).\r\n\r\nThis PR does not address an issue that could occur if legitimate multi-valued rows are processed that are not manipulated with explicit array functions and so are implicitly transformed. Since arrays larger than 1 will still return `0` for primitive value getters, expressions against these values should explicitly decide how to handle actual array inputs and combine them back into a scalar value that the primitive numeric aggregators can understand. Making this a failure condition seemed a bit drastic, but it might be worth considering.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-30T05:11:44Z","updated_at":"2021-08-12T08:49:53Z","closed_at":"2021-05-17T18:59:13Z","merged_at":"2021-05-17T18:59:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"6d08a7051e2d0bf50cfea3fc6d1ed7ebde864a05","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Description\r\nThis PR adds vectorization support for the Druid native expression logical operators, `!`, `&&`, `||`, as well as boolean functions `isnull`, `notnull`, and `nvl`.\r\n\r\nThe `&&`, `||`, and `nvl` implementations are not quite as optimal as they could be, since they will evaluate all arguments up front, but I will fix this up in another branch I have as a follow-up (split from this one because it was starting to get big). The follow-up will add vectorized conditional expressions, and introduces a filtered vector binding that uses vector matches to allow processing only a subset of input rows. This filtered binding will allow slightly modifying these implementations so that `||` only needs to evaluate the rhs rows for which the lhs is false or null, `&&` where lhs is true or null, and `nvl` only when lhs is null.\r\n\r\nIn the process of doing this PR and writing tests, I came to the conclusion that our logical operators behave very strangely all the time, and I think quite wrong in SQL compatible null handling mode since null was always treated as \"false\" instead of \"unknown\", so I've proposed changing the behavior in this PR.\r\n\r\nThe first change is around output. Previously the logical operators would pass values through. For Druid numeric values, any value greater than 0 is `true`, so passing through values would result in some strange but technically correct outputs. The new behavior homogenizes output to always be `LONG` boolean values, e.g. `1` or `0` for boolean operations involving any types. \r\n\r\nPrevious behavior:\r\n* `100 && 11` -> `11` \r\n* `0.7 || 0.3` -> `0.7`\r\n* `100 && 0` -> `0`\r\n* `'troo' && 'true'` -> `'troo'`\r\n* `'troo' || 'true'` -> `'true'`\r\n\r\nNew behavior:\r\n* `100 && 11` -> `1`\r\n* `0.7 || 0.3` -> `1`\r\n* `100 && 0` -> `0`\r\n* `'troo' && 'true'` -> `0`\r\n* `'troo' || 'true'` -> `1`\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe implicit conversion of `STRING`, `DOUBLE`, and `LONG` values to booleans remains in effect:\r\n* `LONG` or `DOUBLE` - any value greater than 0 is considered `true`, else `false`\r\n* `STRING` - the value `'true'` (case insensitive) is considered `true`, everything else is `false`. \r\n\r\nand has been documented.\r\n\r\nThe second change is that now the logical operators in SQL compatible mode will treat `null` as \"unknown\" when `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull` is set as `false` (SQL compatible null handling mode).\r\n\r\nFor the \"or\" operator:\r\n* `true || null`, `null || true` -> `1`\r\n* `false || null`, `null || false`, `null || null`-> `null`\r\n\r\nFor the \"and\" operator:\r\n* `true && null`, `null && true`, `null && null` -> `null`\r\n* `false && null`, `null && false` -> `0`\r\n\r\n\r\nSince this new behavior changes query results, subtly in the case of default mode since the results will be different (but equivalent in terms of true or false result), and fairly significantly in SQL compatible mode since it will now respect `null` values and treat them differently than always false, this PR also adds a new configuration, `druid.expressions.useStrictBooleans`, which defaults to false to use the legacy behavior, but I encourage everyone to switch to the new behavior in this PR to get better performance and SQL compatible behavior. I don't really love this flag existing, but don't see a way around it unless we are ok with changing query results to use the new behavior only. `&&` and `||` will only be vectorized when `druid.expressions.useStrictBooleans=true`.\r\n\r\nbenchmarks:\r\n```\r\n      // 30: logical and operator\r\n      \"SELECT CAST(long1 as BOOLEAN) AND CAST (long2 as BOOLEAN), COUNT(*) FROM foo GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2\",\r\n      // 31: isnull, notnull\r\n      \"SELECT long5 IS NULL, long3 IS NOT NULL, count(*) FROM foo GROUP BY 1,2 ORDER BY 3\"\r\n```\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score    Error  Units\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       30           5000000        false  avgt    5  761.667 ± 35.745  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       30           5000000        force  avgt    5  152.102 ±  9.390  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       31           5000000        false  avgt    5  431.104 ± 32.951  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       31           5000000        force  avgt    5  100.884 ±  8.919  ms/op\r\n```\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug:\r\nAfter setting `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=false`, it was discovered that for columns of type `Long` the sql `is null` selector returns `null` if the input is `null` but that behavior is incorrect for the `is null` function.\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue I have set the `bindings` variable to `null` so that if the selector is `is null`and the value is `null` then it will be evaluated to `true` as expected from this selector. This solution lets the expression handle the behavior for `null` by sending the value of `bindings` to be evaluated in the `eval` function. \r\n\r\nIf the previous input value was also `null` then the computation will be skipped and the cached value for `lastOutput` will be returned to improve performance.\r\n\r\nI have also added a test to the `CalciteQuery` suite to ensure that this case is handled correctly.\r\n\r\n#### Other options considered:\r\nWe can hardcode this special case into `SingleLongInputCachingExpressionColumnValueSelector.java` by checking if the expression `is null` and then returning `true` within that function. This is not the best solution and changing the logic within this function might affect other areas of the code that we don’t know about.\r\nWe could use a different selector for `is null` expressions but this seemed more complicated to implement and is not done for any of the other data types.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * New unit test `testLongPredicateIsNull`\r\n * Extra logic for returning `true` instead of `null` in `SingleLongInputCachingExpressionColumnValueSelector.java`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

This PR adds a similar auto cleanup based on duration (time to retained) but for the rules table to auto clean up rules of inactive datasource (datasource with no used and unused segments)\r\n\r\nThis is useful when Druid user has a high churn of task / datasource in a short amount of time causing the metadata store size to grow uncontrollably. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

the total number of results is not known due to auto limit\r\n- Automatically increase the auto limit by 10x every time you reach the last loaded page\r\n- Don't auto run the query when fresh opening the query view (prevents you from running a stale query)\r\n- Page in the query output get reset to 0 if number of query result changes (vs leaving you in an empty page)\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-23T18:20:58Z","updated_at":"2021-08-12T08:36:50Z","closed_at":"2021-04-27T17:26:01Z","merged_at":"2021-04-27T17:26:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"1b07d554a845edf20845e5f383d219d02950bcb7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Description\r\nThis PR adds `ARRAY_AGG` to SQL, building it on top of the expression aggregator provided in #11104.\r\n\r\n| function | description |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n|`ARRAY_AGG(expr, [size])`|Collects all values of `expr` into an ARRAY, including null values, with `size` in bytes limit on aggregation size (default of 1024 bytes). Use of `ORDER BY` within the `ARRAY_AGG` expression is not currently supported, and the ordering of results within the output array may vary depending on processing order.|\r\n|`ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT expr, [size])`|Collects all distinct values of `expr` into an ARRAY, including null values, with `size` in bytes limit on aggregation size (default of 1024 bytes) per aggregate. Use of `ORDER BY` within the `ARRAY_AGG` expression is not currently supported, and the ordering of results within the output array may vary depending on processing order.|\r\n\r\n Since this is an expression aggregator, it is unlikely to be the most optimal way to provide this functionality, But, it importantly makes it so that we _can_ offer this functionality relatively easily, since arrays are more or less only supported in the expression system at this point, so it is still an improvement.\r\n\r\nUntil we update Apache Calcite to a newer version, we are unable to support the `ORDER BY` that some other databases which offer `ARRAY_AGG` have, due to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-4335. Upgrading Calcite to any newer version is tricky because of requirements of a newer Guava dependency.\r\n\r\nWe also will accept a non-standard 2 argument form of `ARRAY_AGG` as specified above, so that we can specify the maximum buffer aggregator size in bytes, which will be necessary until we have growable buffer aggregators.\r\n\r\nI added a lot of SQL query tests to try and stress some areas of array handling in addition to testing this aggregator itself, including expected failure tests such as trying to group on the output of an array agg output of a subquery or join.\r\n\r\nIt was admittedly rather pleasing to see stuff like\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT dim2, COUNT(*)\r\nFROM foo\r\nWHERE ARRAY_CONTAINS((SELECT ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT dim1) FROM foo WHERE dim1 is not null), dim1)\r\nGROUP BY 1\r\n```\r\nable to just work out of the box after I added the aggregator function, so I consider array support overall to be progressing pretty smoothly.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-23T09:32:41Z","updated_at":"2021-08-12T08:40:18Z","closed_at":"2021-05-04T05:17:10Z","merged_at":"2021-05-04T05:17:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"554f1ffeee94fab1ca0fa641a51f584766e504f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

#10207.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis extension was implementing `AggregatorFactory.getCombiningFactory` in the base class `TimestampAggregatorFactory` which would create a new `TimestampAggregatorFactory`, instead of a `TimestampMaxAggregatorFactory` or `TimestampMinAggregatorFactory`. This meant the combining factory would create a type that was no longer round trip serializable, causing the issue reported in #10207.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by making `TimestampAggregatorFactory` abstract, and implementing this method directly in the min and max agg factories. I also cleaned up equals/hashcode which were missing the format arguments, added `@Nullable` annotations to things which looked like they could be null (I decided this includes `fieldName` since `timestampSpec` uses the default time column if it is null), switched to using `CacheKeyBuilder` (and added format since was missing from cache key).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths,

sure updating auto compaction config is protected against race condition\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe auto compaction config (`coordinator.compaction.config`) contains all the compaction configs for multiple datasources within the same payload. When we do update on auto coordinator config, we first do a read to get the current value and apply the change. The read and write does not have any lock to prevent concurrent update. \r\nFor example, let’s say we currently have current value for compaction config: {datasource x} and we have concurrent deleteCompactionConfig and addOrUpdateCompactionConfig calls happening at the same time in the following order:\r\ndeleteCompactionConfig call to delete x -> deleteCompactionConfig read current which is {x} from JacksonConfigManager-> addOrUpdateCompactionConfig calls to add y -> addOrUpdateCompactionConfig got current which is {x} from JacksonConfigManager-> deleteCompactionConfig write {} to database -> addOrUpdateCompactionConfig write {x, y} to database. Final result is compaction config for x and y in the database. This is incorrect as both calls (call to deleteCompactionConfig and addOrUpdateCompactionConfig) would have returned success and user would expect x to be deleted.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the update to `coordinator.compaction.config` to pass the current config value (which is used to build the new config value) to the MetadataStorageConnector and to use MetadataStorageConnector.compareAndSwap method instead.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-21T22:13:18Z","updated_at":"2021-08-12T08:47:00Z","closed_at":"2021-05-10T20:58:09Z","merged_at":"2021-05-10T20:58:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"3a660bc6ee4fd3320240805e0727ed248002522d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2835139332,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODM1MTM5MzMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Compaction","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nTSLint is deprecated and they recommend switching to ESLint which now has great support for TypeScript and more feature-rich lint plugins for React, React+hooks, etc.\r\n\r\nI used the `tslint-to-eslint-config` automated tool to translate the base config from `awesome-code-style` + local extensions and then reorganized it as additions/overrides to the \"recommended\" configs provided by ESLint, typescript-eslint, etc.\r\n\r\nFinally, I enabled a few more rules that didn't require significant manual changes, favoring those that included fixers.\r\n\r\nOnce these rules are lifted into `awesome-code-style`, there will be a follow-up PR to use the base config it provides instead of specifying everything locally.\r\n\r\n#### Note on Prettier\r\n\r\nIn the previous TSLint config, it used a plugin that treated Prettier as a lint rule. A similar plugin exists for ESLint, but doing this is [actively discouraged by Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/integrating-with-linters.html). Instead, they recommend keeping the two separate, which avoids red squiggly noise in IDEs and is faster (so they say).\r\n\r\nBut note that this requires a couple of changes:\r\n- Explicitly checking formatting during `npm test` &mdash; added the `prettify-check` script to deal with this\r\n- Enabling format-on-save in your IDE &mdash; e.g., in WebStorm, you can run Prettier on format and on save:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"734\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132233/115590688-7e1fc880-a28e-11eb-90ce-c7d67ec819e4.png\">\r\n\r\nIf we want the old behavior back, it would be trivial to add `eslint-plugin-prettier` to the setup, but I think we should give this a fair shake.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-21T16:48:01Z","updated_at":"2021-08-12T08:35:37Z","closed_at":"2021-04-23T02:33:04Z","merged_at":"2021-04-23T02:33:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"9745d9e1c3f9e7664e289a82acffc1130db4a11e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1251906357,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjUxOTA2MzU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Web%20Console","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/pull/11058 added a new rule to handle empty tables, but Druid still uses `BindableConvention` for certain queries that read empty tables. The queries used in unit tests that are changed in this PR are such queries. The bug is in the `traitSet` of `DruidQueryRel` being set to a single trait of `Convention.NONE` when a `DruidQueryRel` is created from a `LogicalValues`. However, `LogicalValues` sometimes have extra traits set such as `RelCollation`. This makes `VolcanoPlanner` think the `DruidQueryRel` is not related to the `LogicalValues` even though `DruidQueryRel` is created from it.\r\n\r\nThere is another method that changes `traitSet` when creating `DruidQueryRel` from `LogicalTableScan` which doesn't seem necessary as well. I will do some testing to make sure that it's not necessary and make another PR to fix it.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Release Notes***\r\n\r\nAdds new Dynamic Coordinator Config `maxNonPrimaryReplicantsToLoad` with default value of `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. This configuration can be used to set a hard upper limit on the number of non-primary replicants that will be loaded in a single Druid Coordinator execution cycle. The default value will mimic the behavior that exists today.\r\n\r\nExample usage: If you set this configuration to 1000, the Coordinator duty `RunRules` will load a maximum of 1000 non-primary replicants in each `RunRules` execution. Meaning if you ingested 2000 segments with a replication factor of 2, the coordinator would load 2000 primary replicants and 1000 non-primary replicants on the first `RunRules` execution. Then the next `RunRules` execution, the last 1000 non-primary replicants will be loaded.\r\n\r\n***End Release Notes***\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\nAdd a new dynamic configuration to the coordinator that gives an operator the power to set a hard limit for the number of non-primary segment replicas that are loaded during a single execution of `RunRules#run`. This allows the operator to limit the amount of work loading non-primary replicas that `RunRules` will execute in a single run. An example of a reason to use a non-default value for this new config is if the operator wants to ensure that major events such as historical service(s) leaving the cluster, large ingestion jobs, etc. do not cause an abnormally long `RunRules` execution compared to the cluster's baseline runtime. \r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\ncluster: 3 historical servers in _default_tier with 18k segments per server. Each segment belongs to a datasource that has the load rule \"LoadForever 2 replicas on _default_tier\". The cluster load status is 100% loaded.\r\n\r\nEvent: 1 historical drops out of the cluster.\r\n\r\nToday: The coordinator will load all 18k segments that are now under-replicated in a single execution of RunRules (as long as Throttling limits are not hit and there is capacity)\r\n\r\nMy change: The coordinator can load a limited number of these under-replicated segments IF the operator has tuned the new dynamic config down from its default. For instance, the operator could say that it is 2k. Meaning it would take at least 9 coordination cycles to fully replicate the segments that were on the recently downed host.\r\n\r\n**Why**\r\n\r\nOperators need to balance lots of competing needs. Having the cluster fully replicated is great for HA. But if an event causes the coordinator to take 20 minutes to fully replicate because it has to load thousands of replicas, we sacrifice the timeliness of loading newly ingested segments that were inserted into the metastore after this long coordination cycle started. Maybe the operator cares more about that fresh data timeliness than the replication status, so they change the new config to a value that causes RunRules to take less time but require more execution cycles to bring the data back to full replication. \r\n\r\nReally what the change aims to do is give an operator more flexibility. As written the default would give the operator the exact same functionality that they see today.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Design**\r\n\r\nI folded this new configuration and feature into ReplicationThrottler.

\r\n\r\nWe should accordingly reduce visibility of Tranquility in the documentation, removing it from the left nav and removing it as one of the streaming ingestion options from the table on the [Ingestion overview](https://druid.apache.org/docs/0.16.0-incubating/ingestion/index.html#streaming) page. \r\n\r\nThis PR takes those steps. \r\n\r\nNot addressed in this PR, but a potential future step could be to remove the [Tranquility page](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/tranquility.html) entirely, redirecting to a \"Deprecated features\" page, where it may be listed. \r\n\r\nAlso not addressed is at least one reference to Tranquility associated with the [`index_realtime`](https://docs.imply.io/latest/druid/ingestion/tasks/#index_realtime) task type.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

Description\r\n\r\n #10786 Introduced an environment variable `ZK_VERSION` in `docker-compose.base.yml` and this env variable is set to `3.5` in pom.xml of integration-test module and the travis file `.travis.yml` .\r\n\r\nIn the README of integration-test module, there's a section describing how to manually bring up Druid cluster by docker-compose. And because of lacking of description that `ZK_VERSION` must be set, following the steps in that section leads to failure of starting up `druid-zookeeper-kafka` service.\r\n\r\nOf course one way to solve that problem is by updating the README to add a step to tell users to set ZK_VERSION before manually bringing up Druid cluster. But I think it's not friendly for users to do this because ZK_VERSION is an interval environment variable mainly for backward compatibility and not a variable exposed to users.\r\n\r\nSo, I make a slight change to the compose file to set the default value of ZK_VERSION to 3.5, so that users don't care about setting this value. \r\n- If ZK_VERSION is not set by shell environment variable, it will default to 3.5\r\n- If ZK_VERSION is set by shell environment variable, it will use the value set by shell\r\n\r\nSuch behaviors are compatible with current ways.\r\n\r\nSince the default value of ZK_VERSION is set in compose file, I also remove zk.version property from pom.xml in integration-test module to simply the management of default version.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

patch does the following:\r\n\r\n- Removes OffheapIncrementalIndex.\r\n- Clarifies that Aggregators are required to be thread safe.\r\n- Clarifies that BufferAggregators and VectorAggregators are not\r\n  required to be thread safe.\r\n- Removes thread safety code from some DataSketches aggregators that\r\n  had it. (Not all of them did, and that's OK, because it wasn't necessary\r\n  anyway.)\r\n- Makes enabling \"useOffheap\" with groupBy v1 an error.\r\n\r\nRationale for removing the offheap incremental index:\r\n\r\n- It is only used in one rare scenario: groupBy v1 (which is non-default)\r\n  in \"useOffheap\" mode (also non-default). So you have to go pretty deep\r\n  into the wilderness to get this code to activate in production. It is\r\n  never used during ingestion.\r\n- Its existence complicates developer efforts to reason about how\r\n  aggregators get used, because the way it uses buffer aggregators is so\r\n  different from how every other query engine uses them.\r\n- It doesn't have meaningful testing.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I do believe that the given way the offheap incremental index\r\nworks, it actually didn't require buffer aggregators to be thread-safe.\r\nIt synchronizes on \"aggregate\" and doesn't call \"get\" until it has\r\nstopped calling \"aggregate\". Nevertheless, this is a bother to think about,\r\nand for the above reasons I think it makes sense to remove the code anyway.","created_at":"2021-04-16T19:02:44Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T07:40:43Z","closed_at":"2021-10-26T15:05:56Z","merged_at":"2021-10-26T15:05:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"fc95c928069537b3f3a6baf86f220b893d42fdc5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Description\r\nCurrently native batch ingestion may run out of memory while ingesting files with lots of logical segments (i.e. Sinks) and multiple physical segments (i.e. FireHydrants) per sink. Memory profiling indicates that one source of memory consumption is the references to memory mapped files being created as firehydrants are created. This will avoid memory mapping firehydrants during segment creation for native batch ingestion and dropping the memory mapping right after they are merged.\r\n\r\nThe fix is relatively simple. Introduce a flag when the `Appenderator` is created to indicate whether it is working on a \"real time\" or batch task. When it is working on a batch task use the flag to avoid mapping the segments.  In addition, just drop the `QueriableIndexSegment` from the fire hydrant just after a given sink is merged.\r\n\r\nI also added metrics to track sinks & hydrants periodically (when persisting and at the end of segment creation phase). This is to have some information for debugging given that these data structures are the heaviest consumers of memory and even though hydrants are no longer mapped during batch their references still accumulate.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Some highlights:\r\n\r\n- TypeScript 4.2\r\n- Webpack 5\r\n- Jest 26\r\n- Prettier 2 (via awesome-code-style)\r\n\r\nWith the upgraded packages, `npm install` will now succeed on Node 14 without needing node-gyp.\r\n\r\nAnd a couple of configuration changes:\r\n- Enable sourcemaps in development mode for nicer debugging in the browser\r\n- Set TypeScript `module` format to `esnext` to allow webpack to tree-shake\r\n\r\nAnd finally, I removed some packages that were not being used.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

This is useful when you only want the queries to hit a subset of data servers for performance testing, debugging purposes, etc. E.g., this value can be set to \"data-memory-tier\" if that's a substring of the hostname convention of historicals you'd like to query and similarly can be set to \"middle\" to only gather results from peon tasks running in middle managers. Note that this feature can only further filter on data servers that are already been selected by the routing logic. In other words, it doesn't allow you to query arbitrary data servers ignoring `druid.broker.select.tier` and `druid.server.priority`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR. Remove the items which are not done or not relevant to the PR.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nNumber of rows/bytes accumulated in memory affects performance of realtime peon tasks. This PR adds metrics for number of rows/bytes in memory before persistence happens so we know if a real time peon task has too many rows accumulated in memory which will impact query performance.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPicked `guage` instead of `count` because we always want to know the current snapshot of number of rows/bytes in memory.\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR. Remove the items which are not done or not relevant to the PR.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nPeon tasks themselves are JVM processes, it’s good to expose their GC logs. This PR enables default peon task GC log and adds s3 push task GC log implementation.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.
