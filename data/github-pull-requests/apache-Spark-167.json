for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nChange `currentPhysicalPlan.logicalLink.get` to `inputPlan.logicalLink.get` for initial logical link.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAt `initialPlan` we may remove some Spark Plan with `queryStagePreparationRules`, if removed Spark Plan is top level node, then we will lose the linked logical node.\r\n\r\nSince we support AQE side broadcast join config. It's more common that a join is SMJ at normal planner and changed to BHJ after AQE reOptimize. However, `RemoveRedundantSorts` is applied before reOptimize at `initialPlan`, then a local sort might be removed incorrectly if a join is SMJ at first but changed to BHJ during reOptimize.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, bug fix\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe RemoveRedundantProjects feature can conflict with the AQE broadcast threshold (PR) sometimes. After removing the project, the physical plan to logical plan link can be changed and we may have a Project above LogicalQueryStage. This breaks AQE broadcast threshold, because the stats of Project does not have the isRuntime = true flag, and thus still use the normal broadcast threshold.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates RemoveRedundantProjects to not remove ProjectExec that has a different logical plan link than its child.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMake AQE broadcast threshold work in more cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe PR is proposed to standardize TypeError messages for unsupported basic operations by:\r\n- Capitalize the first letter\r\n- Leverage TypeError messages defined in `pyspark/pandas/data_type_ops/base.py`\r\n- Take advantage of the utility `is_valid_operand_for_numeric_arithmetic` to save duplicated TypeError messages\r\n\r\nRelated unit tests should be adjusted as well.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nInconsistent TypeError messages are shown for unsupported data-type-based basic operations.\r\n\r\nTake addition's TypeError messages for example:\r\n- addition can not be applied to given types.\r\n- string addition can only be applied to string series or literals.\r\n\r\nStandardizing TypeError messages would improve user experience and reduce maintenance costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo user-facing behavior change. Only TypeError messages are modified.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\nKeyword:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR allows the `Project` node to host outer references in scalar subqueries when `decorrelateInnerQuery` is enabled. It is already supported by the new decorrelation framework and the `RewriteCorrelatedScalarSubquery` rule.\r\n\r\nNote currently by default all correlated subqueries will be decorrelated, which is not necessarily the most optimal approach. Consider `SELECT (SELECT c1) FROM t`. This should be optimized as `SELECT c1 FROM t` instead of rewriting it as a left outer join. This will be done in a separate PR to optimize correlated scalar/lateral subqueries with OneRowRelation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo allow more types of correlated scalar subqueries.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. This PR allows outer query column references in the SELECT cluase of a correlated scalar subquery. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT (SELECT c1) FROM t;\r\n```\r\nBefore this change:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Expressions referencing the outer query are not supported \r\noutside of WHERE/HAVING clauses\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this change:\r\n```\r\n+------------------+\r\n|scalarsubquery(c1)|\r\n+------------------+\r\n|0                 |\r\n|1                 |\r\n+------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests and SQL

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes two issues. One is that `to_json` doesn't support `map` types where value types are `day-time` interval types like:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> select to_json(map('a', interval '1 2:3:4' day to second));\r\n21/07/06 14:53:58 ERROR SparkSQLDriver: Failed in [select to_json(map('a', interval '1 2:3:4' day to second))]\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Failed to convert value 93784000000 (class of class java.lang.Long) with the type of DayTimeIntervalType(0,3) to JSON.\r\n```\r\nThe other issue is that even if the issue of `to_json` is resolved, `from_json` doesn't support to convert `day-time` interval string to JSON. So the result of following query will be `null`.\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> select from_json(to_json(map('a', interval '1 2:3:4' day to second)), 'a interval day to second');\r\n{\"a\":null}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThere should be no reason why day-time intervals cannot used as map value types.\r\n`CalendarIntervalTypes` can do it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew tests.","created_at":"2021-07-06T05:56:50Z","updated_at":"2021-07-06T10:16:09Z","closed_at":"2021-07-06T08:07:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"444adb2c803b84a17f2983fb5f469f38ced70ce4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33225/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33225/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33225/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/96a5d613970bca338bef45888c369ed15d114419","head":{"label":"sarutak:json-dtinterval","ref":"json-dtinterval","sha":"96a5d613970bca338bef45888c369ed15d114419","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

After removing the project, the physical plan to logical plan link can be changed and we may have a `Project` above `LogicalQueryStage`. This breaks AQE broadcast threshold, because the stats of `Project` does not have the `isRuntime = true` flag, and thus still use the normal broadcast threshold.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `RemoveRedundantProjects` to not remove `ProjectExec` that has a different logical plan link than its child.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFor the timestamp literal, it should have the following behavior.\r\n1. When `spark.sql.timestampType` is TIMESTAMP_NTZ: if there is no time zone part, return timestamp without time zone literal; otherwise, return timestamp with local time zone literal\r\n\r\n2. When `spark.sql.timestampType` is TIMESTAMP_LTZ: return timestamp with local time zone literal\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen the default timestamp type is TIMESTAMP_NTZ, the result of type literal should return TIMESTAMP_NTZ when there is no time zone part in the string.\r\n\r\nFrom setion 5.3 \"literal\" of ANSI SQL standard 2011:\r\n```\r\n27) The declared type of a <timestamp literal> that does not specify <time zone interval> is TIMESTAMP(P) WITHOUT TIME ZONE, where P is the number of digits in <seconds fraction>, if specified, and 0 (zero) otherwise. The declared type of a <timestamp literal> that specifies <time zone interval> is TIMESTAMP(P) WITH TIME ZONE, where P is the number of digits in <seconds fraction>, if specified, and 0 (zero) otherwise.\r\n```\r\nSince we don't have \"timestamp with time zone\", we use timestamp with local time zone instead.\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, the new timestmap type and the default timestamp configuration is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, inferring nested structs is always using `MapType`.\r\n\r\nThis behavior causes an issue because it infers the schema with a value type of the first field of the struct as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndata = [{\"inside_struct\": {\"payment\": 100.5, \"name\": \"Lee\"}}]\r\ndf = spark.createDataFrame(data)\r\ndf.show(truncate=False)\r\n+--------------------------------+\r\n|inside_struct                   |\r\n+--------------------------------+\r\n|{name -> null, payment -> 100.5}|\r\n+--------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe \"name\" became `null`, but it should've been `\"Lee\"`.\r\n\r\nIn this case, we need to be able to infer the schema with a `StructType` instead of a `MapType`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR proposes adding an new configuration `spark.sql.pyspark.inferNestedDictAsStruct.enabled` to handle which type is used for inferring nested structs.\r\n- When `spark.sql.pyspark.inferNestedDictAsStruct.enabled` is `false` (by default), inferring nested structs by `MapType`\r\n- When `spark.sql.pyspark.inferNestedDictAsStruct.enabled` is `true`, inferring nested structs by `StructType`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBecause always inferring the nested structs by `MapType` doesn't work properly for some cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNew configuration `spark.sql.pyspark.inferNestedDictAsStruct.enabled` is added.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded an unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33113, to do some code cleanup:\r\n1. `UnresolvedFieldPosition` doesn't need to include the field name. We can get it through \"context\" (`AlterTableAlterColumn.column.name`).\r\n2. Run `ResolveAlterTableCommands` in the main resolution batch, so that the column/field resolution is also unified between v1 and v2 commands (same error message).\r\n3. Fail immediately in `ResolveAlterTableCommands` if we can't resolve the field, instead of waiting until `CheckAnalysis`. We don't expect other rules to resolve fields in ALTER  TABLE commands, so failing immediately is simpler and we can remove duplicated code in `CheckAnalysis`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\ncode simplification.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, spark on kubernetes with client mode would use `\"spark-application-\" + System.currentTimeMillis` as app id by default. It would cause app id conflict if submit several spark applications to kubernetes cluster in a short time.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the event log use app id as the file name. With the conflict event log file, the exception was thrown.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException: File does not exist: xxx/spark-application-1624766876324.lz4.inprogress (inode 5984170846) Holder does not have any open files.\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.FSNamesystem.checkLease(FSNamesystem.java:2697)\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.FSDirWriteFileOp.analyzeFileState(FSDirWriteFileOp.java:521)\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.FSDirWriteFileOp.validateAddBlock(FSDirWriteFileOp.java:161)\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.FSNamesystem.getAdditionalBlock(FSNamesystem.java:2579)\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.NameNodeRpcServer.addBlock(NameNodeRpcServer.java:846)\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocolPB.ClientNamenodeProtocolServerSideTranslatorPB.addBlock(ClientNamenodeProtocolServerSideTranslatorPB.java:510)\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocol.proto.ClientNamenodeProtocolProtos$ClientNamenodeProtocol$2.callBlockingMethod(ClientNamenodeProtocolProtos.java)\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.ipc.ProtobufRpcEngine$Server$ProtoBufRpcInvoker.call(ProtobufRpcEngine.java:503)\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.ipc.RPC$Server.call(RPC.java:989)\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Server$RpcCall.run(Server.java:871)\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Server$RpcCall.run(Server.java:817)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

We currently support top-level value classes just as any other case class; field of the underlying type is present in schema. This means any dataframe SQL filtering on this expects the field name to be present. The previous PR changes this schema and would result in breaking current usage. See test `\"schema for case class that is a value class\"`. This PR keeps the schema.\r\n- We actually currently support collection of value classes prior to this change, but not case class of nested value class. This means the schema of these classes shouldn't change to prevent breaking too. \r\n- However, what we can change, without breaking, is schema of nested value class, which will fails due to the compile problem, and thus its schema now isn't actually valid. After the change, the schema of this nested value class is now flattened\r\n- With this PR, there's flattening only for nested value class (new), but not for top-level and collection classes (existing behavior)\r\n- This PR revisits https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27153 by handling tuple `Tuple2[AnyVal, AnyVal]` which is a constructor (\"nested class\") but is a generic type, so it should not be flattened behaving similarly to `Seq[AnyVal]`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n- Currently, nested value class isn't supported. This is because when the generated code treats `anyVal` class in its unwrapped form, but we encode the type to be the wrapped case class. This results in compile of generated code\r\nFor example, \r\nFor a given `AnyVal` wrapper and its root-level class container\r\n```\r\ncase class IntWrapper(i: Int) extends AnyVal\r\ncase class ComplexValueClassContainer(c: IntWrapper)\r\n```\r\nThe problematic part of generated code:\r\n```\r\n    private InternalRow If_1(InternalRow i) {\r\n        boolean isNull_42 = i.isNullAt(0);\r\n        // 1) ******** The root-level case class we care\r\n        org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ComplexValueClassContainer value_46 = isNull_42 ?\r\n            null : ((org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ComplexValueClassContainer) i.get(0, null));\r\n        if (isNull_42) {\r\n            throw new NullPointerException(((java.lang.String) references[5] /* errMsg */ ));\r\n        }\r\n        boolean isNull_39 = true;\r\n        // 2) ******** We specify its member to be unwrapped case class extending `AnyVal`\r\n        org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.IntWrapper value_43 = null;\r\n        if (!false) {\r\n\r\n            isNull_39 = false;\r\n            if (!isNull_39) {\r\n                // 3) ******** ERROR: `c()` compiled however is of type `int` and thus we see error\r\n                value_43 = value_46.c();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nWe get this errror: Assignment conversion not possible from type \"int\" to type \"org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.IntWrapper\"\r\n```\r\njava.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: org.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompileException: \r\nFile 'generated.java', Line 159, Column 1: failed to compile: org.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompileException: File 'generated.java', Line 159, Column 1: Assignment conversion not possible from type \"int\" to type \"org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.IntWrapper\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom [doc](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/value-classes.html) on value class: , Given: `class Wrapper(val underlying: Int) extends AnyVal`,\r\n1) \"The type at compile time is `Wrapper`, but at runtime, the representation is an `Int`\". This implies that when our struct has a field of value class, the generated code should support the underlying type during runtime execution.\r\n2) `Wrapper` \"must be instantiated... when a value class is used as a type argument\". This implies that `scala.Tuple[Wrapper, ...], Seq[Wrapper], Map[String, Wrapper], Option[Wrapper]` will still contain Wrapper as-is in during runtime instead of `Int`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n- Yes, this will allow support for the nested value class.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

changes needed?\r\n\r\nBefore I used stringType instead of char/varchar, my application code has the logic to judge using canCast. There was no problem before, but now it’s changed to char/varchar, and the judgment of canCast fails. If it doesn’t pass, I Need to change a lot of application code\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\ni add

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to migrate the following `ALTER TABLE ... ADD/REPLACE COLUMNS` commands to use `UnresolvedTable` as a `child` to resolve the table identifier. This allows consistent resolution rules (temp view first, etc.) to be applied for both v1/v2 commands. More info about the consistent resolution rule proposal can be found in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900) or [proposal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvLjGA8y_W_hhilpngXVub1Ebv8RsMap986nENCFnrg/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a part of effort to make the relation lookup behavior consistent: [SPARK-29900](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nAfter this PR, the above `ALTER TABLE ... ADD/REPLACE COLUMNS` commands will have a consistent resolution behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-03T05:43:44Z","updated_at":"2021-07-28T06:00:38Z","closed_at":"2021-07-28T06:00:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"01ac5f73923c2c157c468575e5b412aca66ea215","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33200/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33200/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33200/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d2e691086b80fb7f64d1bce144bd1bdd03428b8d","head":{"label":"imback82:alter_add_cols","ref":"alter_add_cols","sha":"d2e691086b80fb7f64d1bce144bd1bdd03428b8d","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

fails.\r\n\r\n```\r\nAssertionError: DataFrame.iloc[:, 0] (column name=\"a\") are different\r\nDataFrame.iloc[:, 0] (column name=\"a\") values are different (14.28571 %)\r\n[index]: [a, b, c, d, e, f, g]\r\n[left]:  [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]\r\n[right]: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 4.807406715958909e-17]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified tests should still pass.\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-02T17:27:37Z","updated_at":"2021-07-04T01:26:42Z","closed_at":"2021-07-02T21:09:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"88d099aedfd36dd17a68ead6cc22b6d89dfebcc0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33193/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33193/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33193/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d8bccfc3991b5fdc216345d2b1578f2d9f858cff","head":{"label":"ueshin:issuse/SPARK-35981/3.2/corr","ref":"issuse/SPARK-35981/3.2/corr","sha":"d8bccfc3991b5fdc216345d2b1578f2d9f858cff","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

commit makes sure that for File Source V2 partition filters are\r\nalso taken into account when the readDataSchema is empty.\r\nThis is the case for queries like:\r\n\r\n    SELECT count(*) FROM tbl WHERE partition=foo\r\n    SELECT input_file_name() FROM tbl WHERE partition=foo\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs described in SPARK-35985 there is bug in the File Datasource V2 which prevents it to push down to the FileScanner for queries like the ones listed above.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf partitions filters are not pushed down, the whole dataset will be scanned while only one partition is interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAn extra test was added which relies on the output of explain, as is done in other places.\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-02T13:51:55Z","updated_at":"2021-07-16T05:24:04Z","closed_at":"2021-07-16T04:53:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e943addbc48a71c357396f3f4af75bae16270934","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33191/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33191/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33191/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8269dda6dc9947c010a713a7fb1b7b2be004c0c2","head":{"label":"steven-aerts:SPARK-35985","ref":"SPARK-35985","sha":"8269dda6dc9947c010a713a7fb1b7b2be004c0c2","user":{"login":"steven-aerts","id":1381633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE2MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-aerts","html_url":"https://github.com/steven-aerts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-aerts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-aerts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-aerts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-aerts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-aerts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-aerts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-aerts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-aerts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-aerts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":228390865,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjgzOTA4NjU=","name":"spark","full_name":"steven-aerts/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"steven-aerts","id":1381633,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE2MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381633?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-aerts","html_url":"https://github.com/steven-aerts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-aerts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-aerts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-aerts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-aerts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-aerts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-aerts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-aerts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-aerts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steven-aerts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/steven-aerts/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR removes sbt-avro plugin dependency.\r\nIn the current master, Build with SBT depends on the plugin but it seems never used.\r\nOriginally, the plugin was introduced for `flume-sink` in SPARK-1729 (#807) but `flume-sink` is no longer in Spark repository.\r\n\r\nAfter SBT was upgraded to 1.x in SPARK-21708 (#29286), `avroGenerate` part was introduced in `object SQL` in `SparkBuild.scala`.\r\nIt's confusable but I understand `Test / avroGenerate := (Compile / avroGenerate).value` is for suppressing sbt-avro for `sql` sub-module.\r\nIn fact, Test/compile will fail if `Test / avroGenerate :=(Compile / avroGenerate).value` is commented out.\r\n\r\n`sql` sub-module contains `parquet-compat.avpr` and `parquet-compat.avdl` but according to `sql/core/src/test/README.md`, they are intended to be handled by `gen-avro.sh`.\r\n\r\nAlso, in terms of Maven build, there seems to be no definition to handle `*.avpr` or `*.avdl`.\r\n\r\nBased on the above, I think we can remove `sbt-avro`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIf `sbt-avro` is really no longer used, it's confusable that `sbt-avro` related configurations are in `SparkBuild.scala`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nGA.","created_at":"2021-07-02T11:17:46Z","updated_at":"2021-07-02T18:01:08Z","closed_at":"2021-07-02T18:01:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fcf7e1fa27f99edad2a8a3aa62ecbe38c747d967","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33190/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33190/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33190/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/20f076b8fb51433c5e497096b959c7a1063deaae","head":{"label":"sarutak:remove-avro-from-sbt","ref":"remove-avro-from-sbt","sha":"20f076b8fb51433c5e497096b959c7a1063deaae","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSkip remove shuffle if it's shuffle origin is not `REPARTITION_BY_COL` in AQE.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`REPARTITION_BY_COL` doesn't guarantee the output partitioning number so we can remove it safely in AQE.\r\n\r\nFor `REPARTITION_BY_NUM`, we should retain the shuffle which partition number is specified by user.\r\nFor `REBALANCE_PARTITIONS_BY_COL`, it is a special shuffle used to rebalance partitions so we should not remove it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nMake the ANSI flag part of expressions `Sum` and `Average`'s parameter list, instead of fetching it from the sessional SQLConf.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor Views, it is important to show consistent results even the ANSI configuration is different in the running session. This is why many expressions like 'Add'/'Divide' making the ANSI flag part of its case class parameter list.\r\n\r\nWe should make it consistent for the expressions `Sum` and `Average`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the `Sum` and `Average` inside a View always behaves the same, independent of the ANSI model SQL configuration in the current session.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a config `spark.sql.join.forceApplyShuffledHashJoin` to force applying shuffled hash join\r\nduring the join selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn the `SQLQueryTestSuite`, we want to cover 3 kinds of join (BHJ, SHJ, SMJ) in join.sql. But even\r\nif the `spark.sql.join.preferSortMergeJoin` is set to `false`, shuffled hash join is still not guaranteed.\r\nThus, we need another config to force the selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, only for testing\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nnewly added tests\r\nVerified all queries in join.sql will use `ShuffledHashJoin` when the config set to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes two issues. One is that `to_json` doesn't support `map` types where value types are `year-month` interval types like:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> select to_json(map('a', interval '1-2' year to  month));\r\n21/07/02 11:38:15 ERROR SparkSQLDriver: Failed in [select to_json(map('a', interval '1-2' year to  month))]\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Failed to convert value 14 (class of class java.lang.Integer) with the type of YearMonthIntervalType(0,1) to JSON.\r\n```\r\nThe other issue is that even if the issue of `to_json` is resolved, `from_json` doesn't support to convert `year-month` interval string to JSON. So the result of following query will be `null`.\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> select from_json(to_json(map('a', interval '1-2' year to month)), 'a interval year to month');\r\n{\"a\":null}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThere should be no reason why year-month intervals cannot used as map value types.\r\n`CalendarIntervalTypes` can do it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd path level discover for python unittests.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1736354/124094503-6bdeb980-da8b-11eb-9bbe-b086024f6902.png)\r\n\r\nChange list:\r\n- Introduce a **python_discover_paths** in modules.\r\n- Add **_discover_python_unittests** function: it would be called in pthon/run-tests.py to load test module.\r\n- Add **_append_discovred_goals function**: call _discover_python_unittests to refresh m.python_test_goals\r\n- if modules have python_test_goals or **python_discover_paths** would also be considered as python tests.\r\n- Fix: Move logging.basicConfig to head to make sure logging config before any possible logging print.\r\n- Fix: Change python/pyspark/testing/utils.py SPARK_HOME use _find_spark_home to get value.\r\n- Fix: export py4j PYTHONPATH before run test.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n- **Why use walk_packages but not unittest.defaultTestLoader.discover?** we use `pkgutil.walk_packages` and `unittest.defaultTestLoader.loadTestsFromModule` to load test modules, consider we will add doctest discover in future, we can add something like blow as the impletations of doctest discover: \r\n```python\r\nimport doctest\r\n\r\ndef _contain_doctests_class(module):\r\n    suite = doctest.DocTestSuite(module)\r\n    if suite.countTestCases():\r\n        return True\r\n    else:\r\n        return False\r\n```\r\n- **Why we doesn't add doctests in here**? Currently, not all modules doctests are added to `python_test_goals`, that means these doctests doesn't be excuted, so better add discover doctests in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n- **What's the deps of discover?** the test discover will do real import for every modules, so we need install **all deps of PySpark test modules** before run-tests otherwise the ImportError would be raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNow we need to specify the python test cases by manually when we add a new testcase. Sometime, we forgot to add the testcase to module list, the testcase would not be executed.\r\n\r\nSuch as:\r\n\r\npyspark-core pyspark.tests.test_pin_thread\r\n\r\nThus we need some auto-discover way to find all testcase rather than specified every case by manually.\r\n\r\nrelated: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32867\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Add doc tests for _discover_python_unittests.\r\n2.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nBy default, AQE will set `COALESCE_PARTITIONS_MIN_PARTITION_NUM` to the spark default parallelism, which is usually quite big. This is to keep the parallelism on par with non-AQE, to avoid perf regressions.\r\n\r\nHowever, this usually leads to many small/empty partitions, and hurts performance (although not worse than non-AQE). Users usually blindly set `COALESCE_PARTITIONS_MIN_PARTITION_NUM` to 1, which makes this config quite useless.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new config to set the min partition size, to avoid too small partitions after coalescing. By default, Spark will not respect the target size, and only respect this min partition size, to maximize the parallelism and avoid perf regression in AQE. This PR also adds a bool config to respect the target size when coalescing partitions, and it's recommended to set it to get better overall performance. This PR also deprecates the `COALESCE_PARTITIONS_MIN_PARTITION_NUM` config.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAQE is default on now, we should make the perf better in the default case.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, a new config.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBy default, the executor pod prefix is generated by the app name. It handles characters that match [^a-z0-9\\\\-] differently. The '.' and all whitespaces will be converted to '-', but other ones to empty string. Especially,  characters like '_', '|' are commonly used as a word separator in many languages.\r\n\r\nAccording to the K8S DNS Label Names, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-label-names, we can convert all special characters to `-`.\r\n\r\n \r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> \"xyz_abc_i_am_a_app_name_w/_some_abbrs\".replaceAll(\"[^a-z0-9\\\\-]\", \"-\").replaceAll(\"-+\", \"-\")\r\nres11: String = xyz-abc-i-am-a-app-name-w-some-abbrs\r\n\r\nscala> \"xyz_abc_i_am_a_app_name_w/_some_abbrs\".replaceAll(\"\\\\s+\", \"-\").replaceAll(\"\\\\.\", \"-\").replaceAll(\"[^a-z0-9\\\\-]\", \"\").replaceAll(\"-+\", \"-\")\r\nres12: String = xyzabciamaappnamewsomeabbrs\r\n```\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> \"time.is%the￥most$valuable_——————thing,it's about time.\".replaceAll(\"[^a-z0-9\\\\-]\", \"-\").replaceAll(\"-+\", \"-\")\r\nres9: String = time-is-the-most-valuable-thing-it-s-about-time-\r\n\r\nscala> \"time.is%the￥most$valuable_——————thing,it's about time.\".replaceAll(\"\\\\s+\", \"-\").replaceAll(\"\\\\.\", \"-\").replaceAll(\"[^a-z0-9\\\\-]\", \"\").replaceAll(\"-+\", \"-\")\r\nres10: String = time-isthemostvaluablethingits-about-time-\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor better UX\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes, the executor pod name might look better\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe time name of `TimestampWithoutTZType` is verbose. Rename it as `TimestampNTZType` so that\r\n1. it is easier to read and type.\r\n2. As we have the function to_timestamp_ntz, this makes the names consistent.\r\n3. We will introduce a new SQL configuration `spark.sql.timestampType` for the default timestamp type. The configuration values can be \"TIMESTMAP_NTZ\" or \"TIMESTMAP_LTZ\" for simplicity.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, the new timestamp type is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nRun `git grep -i WithoutTZ` and there is no result.\r\nAnd Ci tests.","created_at":"2021-07-01T06:46:37Z","updated_at":"2021-07-01T12:04:08Z","closed_at":"2021-07-01T08:49:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9fa36adca63963f99d35671379c08a4aadc5e0c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33167/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33167/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33167/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f197b733096c591e27ab1536d9075f32ef39b350","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:rename","ref":"rename","sha":"f197b733096c591e27ab1536d9075f32ef39b350","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRemove dead code in `OptimizeLocalShuffleReader`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAfter [SPARK-35725](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35725), we might expand partition if that partition is skewed. So the partition number check `bytesByPartitionId.length == partitionSpecs.size` would be wrong if some partitions are coalesced and some partitions are splitted into smaller.\r\nNote that, it's unlikely happened in real world since it used RoundRobin.\r\n\r\nOtherhand, after [SPARK-34899](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-34899), we use origin plan if can not coalesce partitions. So the assuming of that shuffle stage has `CustomShuffleReaderExec` with no effect is always false in `REBALANCE_PARTITIONS_BY_NONE` shuffle origin. That said, if no rule was efficient, there would be no `CustomShuffleReaderExec`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRefactors the base Throwable trait `SparkError.scala` (introduced in SPARK-34920) an interface `SparkThrowable.java`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- Renaming `SparkError` to `SparkThrowable` better reflect sthat this is the base interface for both `Exception` and `Error`\r\n- Migrating to Java maximizes its extensibility\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes; the base trait has been renamed and the accessor methods have changed (eg. `sqlState` -> `getSqlState()`).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMake unary and comparison operators data-type-based. Refactored operators include: \r\n- Unary operators: `__neg__`, `__abs__`, `__invert__`, \r\n- Comparison operators: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`\r\n\r\nNon-goal: Tasks below are inspired during the development of this PR.\r\n[[SPARK-35997] Implement comparison operators for CategoricalDtype in pandas API on Spark](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35997)\r\n[[SPARK-36000] Support creating a ps.Series/Index with `Decimal('NaN')` with Arrow disabled](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36000)\r\n[[SPARK-36001] Assume result's index to be disordered in tests with operations on different Series](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36001)\r\n[[SPARK-36002] Consolidate tests for data-type-based operations of decimal Series](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36002)\r\n[[SPARK-36003] Implement unary operator `invert` of numeric ps.Series/Index](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36003)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe have been refactoring basic operators to be data-type-based for readability, flexibility, and extensibility.\r\nUnary and comparison operators are still not data-type-based yet. We should fill the gaps.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n- Better error messages. For example,\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```py\r\n>>> import pyspark.pandas as ps\r\n>>> psser = ps.Series([b\"2\", b\"3\", b\"4\"])\r\n>>> -psser\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\npyspark.sql.utils.AnalysisException: cannot resolve '(- `0`)' due to data type mismatch: ...\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```py\r\n>>> import pyspark.pandas as ps\r\n>>> psser = ps.Series([b\"2\", b\"3\", b\"4\"])\r\n>>> -psser\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nTypeError: Unary - can not be applied to binaries.\r\n>>> \r\n```\r\n- Support unary `-` of `bool` Series. For example,\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```py\r\n>>> psser = ps.Series([True, False, True])\r\n>>> -psser\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\npyspark.sql.utils.AnalysisException: cannot resolve '(- `0`)' due to data type mismatch: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```py\r\n>>> psser = ps.Series([True, False, True])\r\n>>> -psser\r\n0    False\r\n1     True\r\n2    False\r\ndtype: bool\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\nKeyword:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd a new Maven profile `no-shaded-hadoop-client` that, when activated, switches to non-shaded Hadoop client (e.g., `hadoop-client`, `hadoop-yarn-client`, etc). \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently Spark uses Hadoop shaded client by default. However, if Spark users want to build Spark with older version of Hadoop, such as 3.1.x, the shaded client cannot be used as it currently it only support Hadoop 3.2.2+ and 3.3.1+). Therefore, this proposes to offer a new Maven profile \"no-shaded-hadoop-client\" for this use case.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, now users can choose to build Apache Spark with non-shaded Hadoop client, e.g.:\r\n```shell\r\nbuild/mvn package -DskipTests -Dhadoop.version=3.1.1 -Pno-shaded-hadoop-client\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2021-06-30T23:33:10Z","updated_at":"2021-12-20T00:12:06Z","closed_at":"2021-12-20T00:12:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6207f47696883f0c51eb9a1db664088fcd7fedb1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33160/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33160/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33160/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4bf4533b8c7e9c7b2f264ede6a14cad52c33b194","head":{"label":"sunchao:no-shaded-client","ref":"no-shaded-client","sha":"4bf4533b8c7e9c7b2f264ede6a14cad52c33b194","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIntroduce `Name` and `Label` type aliases to distinguish what is expected instead of `Any` or `Union[Any, Tuple]`.\r\n\r\n- `Label`: `Tuple[Any, ...]`\r\n  Internal expression for name-like metadata, like `index_names`, `column_labels`, and `column_label_names` in `InternalFrame`, and similar internal structures.\r\n- `Name`: `Union[Any, Label]`\r\n  External expression for user-facing names, which can be scalar values or tuples.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently `Any` or `Union[Any, Tuple]` is used for name-like types, but type aliases should be used to distinguish what is expected clearly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

SPARK-35949\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFrom v3.1, spark context will close after invoking main method. In some case, it is necessary to keep spark context alive. Such as start app as a server. I add `keep-saprk-context-alive` arg to set whether should keep spark context alive after main method.\r\n\r\n## Why are the changes needed?\r\nDue to pr c625eb4#diff-f8564df81d845c0cd2f621bc2ed22761cbf9731f28cb2828d9cbd0491f4e7584. In client mode, the spark context will be stopped on application start. it is necessary to keep spark context alive. Such as start app as a server\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. Added a `keep-saprk-context-alive` args to set keeping the spark context alive until the app exit. Usage `spark-submit --keep-saprk-context-alive true`\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManually

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to catch all non-fatal exceptions coming `refreshTable()` at the final stage of table repairing, and output an error message instead of failing with an exception.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. The uncaught exceptions from table refreshing might be considered as regression comparing to previous Spark versions. Table refreshing was introduced by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31066.\r\n2. This should improve user experience with Spark SQL. For instance, when the `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` is performed in a chain of command in SQL where catching exception is difficult or even impossible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Before the changes the `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` command can fail with the exception portrayed in SPARK-35935. After the changes, the same command outputs error message, and completes successfully.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites. For instance:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *CachedTableSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2021-06-30T07:06:13Z","updated_at":"2021-06-30T12:00:09Z","closed_at":"2021-06-30T08:47:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7702f557e0ca34efeca1a23c4bc55ffc4aa1f845","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33152/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33152/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33152/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6f9ff9e6891ddd72276090cb42a6ce5d5f4fb739","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:msck-repair-catch-except-3.1","ref":"msck-repair-catch-except-3.1","sha":"6f9ff9e6891ddd72276090cb42a6ce5d5f4fb739","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is the followup from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33012#discussion_r659440833, where we want to add `@Unstable` to `FileCommitProtocol`, to give people a better idea of API.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMake it easier for people to follow and understand code. Clean up code.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently ,we sets the environment variable `PYSPARK_PIN_THREAD` at the client side of `InhertiableThread` API for Py4J (`python/pyspark/util.py`). If the Py4J gateway is created somewhere else (e.g., Zeppelin, etc), it could introduce a breakage at:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark import SparkContext\r\njvm = SparkContext._jvm\r\nthread_connection = jvm._gateway_client.get_thread_connection()\r\n# `AttributeError: 'GatewayClient' object has no attribute 'get_thread_connection'` (non-pinned thread mode)\r\n# `get_thread_connection` is only in 'ClientServer' (pinned thread mode)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to check the given gateway created, and do the pinned thread mode behaviour accordingly so we can avoid any breakage when Py4J server/gateway is created separately from somewhere else without a pinned thread mode.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo avoid any potential breakage.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the change happened only in the master (https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/fdd7ca5f4e35a906090f3c6b160bdba9ac9fd0ca).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is actually a partial revert of https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/fdd7ca5f4e35a906090f3c6b160bdba9ac9fd0ca. As long as the existing tests pass, I guess we're all good.\r\n\r\nI also manually tested to make doubly sure:\r\n\r\n**Before**:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark import InheritableThread,

If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that cast the struct which contains null value to other type has a difference result when we enable/disable codegen.\r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  val schema = StructType(Seq(StructField(\"value\",\r\n    StructType(Seq(\r\n      StructField(\"x\", IntegerType, nullable = false),\r\n      StructField(\"y\", IntegerType, nullable = false)\r\n    ))\r\n  )))\r\n  schema.printTreeString()\r\n  // root\r\n  // |-- value: struct (nullable = true)\r\n  // |    |-- x: integer (nullable = false)\r\n  // |    |-- y: integer (nullable = false)\r\n  \r\n  val testDS = Seq(\"\"\"{\"value\":{\"x\":1}}\"\"\").toDS\r\n  val jsonDS = spark.read.schema(schema).json(testDS)\r\n\r\n  jsonDS.show()\r\n  // incorrect result\r\n  // +---------+\r\n  // |    value|\r\n  // +---------+\r\n  // |{1, null}|\r\n  // +---------+\r\n\r\n  spark.sql(\"set spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage=false\")\r\n  jsonDS.show()\r\n  // the result we expected due to y.nullable = false.\r\n  // +------+\r\n  // | value|\r\n  // +------+\r\n  // |{1, 0}|\r\n  // +------+\r\n```\r\nActually, the result should be depending on the field nullable setting. this bug also happens when we cast struct to struct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, only bug fix.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNew
