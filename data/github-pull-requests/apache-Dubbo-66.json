quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-25T12:28:24Z","updated_at":"2018-12-26T04:19:33Z","closed_at":"2018-12-26T02:25:43Z","merged_at":"2018-12-26T02:25:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"77891b4dc13ef73c161950b555cfeecfab71bcba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3058/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3058/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3058/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/98ad0fef0355b0a8a5f80d1106f6fd7758a97ef2","head":{"label":"kexianjun:fix-3057","ref":"fix-3057","sha":"98ad0fef0355b0a8a5f80d1106f6fd7758a97ef2","user":{"login":"kexianjun","id":12162539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTYyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12162539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun","html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":145399297,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDUzOTkyOTc=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kexianjun/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kexianjun","id":12162539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTYyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12162539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun","html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun/dubbo","description":"Apache

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-21T08:48:00Z","updated_at":"2019-01-17T02:57:51Z","closed_at":"2019-01-16T06:59:16Z","merged_at":"2019-01-16T06:59:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"416c57529f81f8d8df27e46c0e60501daeb5e867","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3043/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3043/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3043/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/67811f6e71737643e8e9a3befdbd54b4d60d84f6","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:wrongEventSetting","ref":"wrongEventSetting","sha":"67811f6e71737643e8e9a3befdbd54b4d60d84f6","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

xxxService“ to change the path，then we invoke \"trace  xxxMethod 10\" to trace a method 。\r\n\r\nIf we invoke like this \"trace  xxxMethod 10\" and the service is not equals null（we have changed the

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-21T06:19:01Z","updated_at":"2018-12-21T06:25:47Z","closed_at":"2018-12-21T06:25:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6f6eeef570045536caafc1b9f673ad0aed5b78a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3036/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3036/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3036/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f2b27fae9403e209ed596b84d9400590e83ad692","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:wrongEventSetting","ref":"wrongEventSetting","sha":"f2b27fae9403e209ed596b84d9400590e83ad692","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-21T02:45:41Z","updated_at":"2018-12-21T13:59:17Z","closed_at":"2018-12-21T13:58:55Z","merged_at":"2018-12-21T13:58:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"69e72041943f247360249ba191ac1217217f43a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3035/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3035/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3035/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5268722001b82648dcf4efd9dc43abaa44039590","head":{"label":"beiwei30:limitfilter","ref":"limitfilter","sha":"5268722001b82648dcf4efd9dc43abaa44039590","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"3e6ae66fde6db2edb139e59d3c5530c9196b4144","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the

Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-19T21:07:06Z","updated_at":"2018-12-20T03:37:57Z","closed_at":"2018-12-20T03:37:57Z","merged_at":"2018-12-20T03:37:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"1a068740a001da0a658c7839f107ae4aa03679e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3020/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3020/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3020/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ffb9d4250a26c895a5de81f1b768b37b5e5ab485","head":{"label":"sergioescala:null-validation-not-needed","ref":"null-validation-not-needed","sha":"ffb9d4250a26c895a5de81f1b768b37b5e5ab485","user":{"login":"sergioescala","id":17890515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODkwNTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17890515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioescala","html_url":"https://github.com/sergioescala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioescala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioescala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioescala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioescala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioescala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioescala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioescala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioescala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioescala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":162489233,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjI0ODkyMzM=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"sergioescala/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sergioescala","id":17890515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODkwNTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17890515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioescala","html_url":"https://github.com/sergioescala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioescala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioescala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioescala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioescala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioescala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioescala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioescala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioescala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioescala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sergioescala/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n在一个switch块内，每个case要么通过break/return等来终止，要么注释说明程序将继续执行到哪一个case为止；在一个switch块内，都必须包含一个default语句并且放在最后，即使它什么代码也没有。\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n编码规则\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-19T09:23:16Z","updated_at":"2019-01-04T15:42:01Z","closed_at":"2019-01-04T15:42:01Z","merged_at":"2019-01-04T15:42:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"ddb518de3ab3b54ec4b6a8a52db6cde1b3f58262","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3016/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3016/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3016/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/eb2882aa5dc75c37a1bc3d2c474e251b2bd98535","head":{"label":"x-ultimate:master","ref":"master","sha":"eb2882aa5dc75c37a1bc3d2c474e251b2bd98535","user":{"login":"x-ultimate","id":18657682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjU3Njgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18657682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-ultimate","html_url":"https://github.com/x-ultimate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-ultimate/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-ultimate/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-ultimate/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-ultimate/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-ultimate/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-ultimate/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-ultimate/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-ultimate/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-ultimate/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"859efeff747587c10cae4fdbfbf38719ec44e009","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-18T05:27:10Z","updated_at":"2019-01-17T02:56:46Z","closed_at":"2019-01-16T02:05:53Z","merged_at":"2019-01-16T02:05:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"66afe965280373142e64fe969c434740a92a373e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3003/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3003/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3003/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8fbcf1c2863d1985f16587cdb234ba0510fdff47","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:master_lowerCamelCase","ref":"master_lowerCamelCase","sha":"8fbcf1c2863d1985f16587cdb234ba0510fdff47","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRemove unnecessary rules： https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues/2980\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n`checkstyle.xml`\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-17T02:59:59Z","updated_at":"2018-12-17T06:26:14Z","closed_at":"2018-12-17T06:26:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"30d4dad7430df552f007f4bfcc0e61a8891ff5f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2982/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2982/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2982/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ec90968cadefb656b588ab70ee2d837c541bf347","head":{"label":"zonghaishang:remove_check_rule","ref":"remove_check_rule","sha":"ec90968cadefb656b588ab70ee2d837c541bf347","user":{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":121260009,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjEyNjAwMDk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"zonghaishang/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang/dubbo","description":"Open

this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-17T02:36:35Z","updated_at":"2018-12-17T07:58:11Z","closed_at":"2018-12-17T07:58:10Z","merged_at":"2018-12-17T07:58:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"fa41d6ff039b8951dd6e40aa47abf6bc69ee3e4a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2979/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2979/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2979/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/be4a40b5d7687a864fe2a416a493fb0c1689038a","head":{"label":"leihuazhe:fix_branch","ref":"fix_branch","sha":"be4a40b5d7687a864fe2a416a493fb0c1689038a","user":{"login":"leihuazhe","id":25452025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDUyMDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25452025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leihuazhe","html_url":"https://github.com/leihuazhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leihuazhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leihuazhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leihuazhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leihuazhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leihuazhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leihuazhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leihuazhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leihuazhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leihuazhe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c55845916b0ffe4d88d829f359b4bef51a9757ad","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2018-12-16T09:53:22Z","updated_at":"2018-12-17T07:54:09Z","closed_at":"2018-12-17T07:54:09Z","merged_at":"2018-12-17T07:54:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"99632b38dbc87bc3e706985bd887a3e0aa329e42","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2976/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2976/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2976/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b34494c25beac3dc22affe16d978485a5e93ccd5","head":{"label":"lixiaojiee:20181216-A","ref":"20181216-A","sha":"b34494c25beac3dc22affe16d978485a5e93ccd5","user":{"login":"lixiaojiee","id":34837528,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0ODM3NTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34837528?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee","html_url":"https://github.com/lixiaojiee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"31de87008a33129d82236cfbf107fdf50cb477ad","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [2935](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues/2935) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-14T06:44:04Z","updated_at":"2020-04-26T07:17:53Z","closed_at":"2020-04-26T07:17:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ad14ba02ac28cd4bdda812d1d457c0c970e7f621","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2964/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2964/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2964/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4ba2bf8d5fd5da50b59ee8d411f856958ab0f022","head":{"label":"cvictory:issue_2881","ref":"issue_2881","sha":"4ba2bf8d5fd5da50b59ee8d411f856958ab0f022","user":{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":126129533,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjYxMjk1MzM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"cvictory/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-14T03:39:36Z","updated_at":"2018-12-17T09:34:31Z","closed_at":"2018-12-17T08:55:08Z","merged_at":"2018-12-17T08:55:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"e6e7ea8b12d952a9ccb53e73ace18231effbf767","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2963/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2963/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2963/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/50f6feddc73f74f086845d06fb3386a6c9c8a475","head":{"label":"beiwei30:code-enhance","ref":"code-enhance","sha":"50f6feddc73f74f086845d06fb3386a6c9c8a475","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c55845916b0ffe4d88d829f359b4bef51a9757ad","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-13T16:34:01Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T12:34:59Z","closed_at":"2019-01-24T07:13:01Z","merged_at":"2019-01-24T07:13:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"c72708bfb63fcbcad67a335a46a4a7e5f097f5e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2959/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2959/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2959/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ffb25290809f4bb6d686fa0e59b42343c02a08fb","head":{"label":"tswstarplanet:service-config-bug-fix","ref":"service-config-bug-fix","sha":"ffb25290809f4bb6d686fa0e59b42343c02a08fb","user":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"678cdb4184b9397c70b94e1b696cf11bcf16b1e5","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-13T12:01:33Z","updated_at":"2018-12-14T04:45:25Z","closed_at":"2018-12-14T03:52:03Z","merged_at":"2018-12-14T03:52:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"f5be817c0077c85c0d9ecc0026d0fd396684a03a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2958/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2958/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2958/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/05ef8ef6447b5df154f880eb72febb89c85f72d9","head":{"label":"maoyiz:maven-cmd-error","ref":"maven-cmd-error","sha":"05ef8ef6447b5df154f880eb72febb89c85f72d9","user":{"login":"maoyiz","id":11908486,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTA4NDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11908486?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz","html_url":"https://github.com/maoyiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":138553275,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzg1NTMyNzU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"maoyiz/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maoyiz","id":11908486,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTA4NDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11908486?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz","html_url":"https://github.com/maoyiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maoyiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maoyiz/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nut pass\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2018-12-12T11:09:02Z","updated_at":"2018-12-17T09:28:36Z","closed_at":"2018-12-17T09:28:36Z","merged_at":"2018-12-17T09:28:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"83a75d3c19df598437cc622cbb7ec1daf0273a79","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2947/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2947/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2947/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9295f422f867df31623f8d5a26c41225c25aa632","head":{"label":"lixiaojiee:master","ref":"master","sha":"9295f422f867df31623f8d5a26c41225c25aa632","user":{"login":"lixiaojiee","id":34837528,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0ODM3NTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34837528?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee","html_url":"https://github.com/lixiaojiee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"31de87008a33129d82236cfbf107fdf50cb477ad","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-12T02:14:13Z","updated_at":"2018-12-13T01:26:34Z","closed_at":"2018-12-12T02:40:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"57c7f290dd19c09579855a2af449108629887dc8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2944/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2944/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2944/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/28618af6b00559c3b573df83f4d5cfcbb74c2144","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:master_preventNullException","ref":"master_preventNullException","sha":"28618af6b00559c3b573df83f4d5cfcbb74c2144","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-11T15:04:15Z","updated_at":"2018-12-11T15:04:50Z","closed_at":"2018-12-11T15:04:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3704de2d3fb41ffcf1c0d35f75ab0adfc825a3f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2943/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2943/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2943/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3638d0525371e35b0aff55e80c7459086010db17","head":{"label":"LittleFi987:master","ref":"master","sha":"3638d0525371e35b0aff55e80c7459086010db17","user":{"login":"LittleFi987","id":19308346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzA4MzQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19308346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LittleFi987","html_url":"https://github.com/LittleFi987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LittleFi987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LittleFi987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LittleFi987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LittleFi987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LittleFi987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LittleFi987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LittleFi987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LittleFi987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LittleFi987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":87319321,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NzMxOTMyMQ==","name":"dubbo","full_name":"LittleFi987/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LittleFi987","id":19308346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzA4MzQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19308346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LittleFi987","html_url":"https://github.com/LittleFi987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LittleFi987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LittleFi987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LittleFi987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LittleFi987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LittleFi987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LittleFi987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LittleFi987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LittleFi987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LittleFi987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LittleFi987/dubbo","description":":loudspeaker:

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nenhance org.apache.dubbo.rpc.protocol.dubbo.telnet.InvokeTelnetHandler#isMatch, a follow up of #2803. \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to call CompatibleTypeUtils.compatibleTypeConvert(arg, type) since PojoUtils.realize() will cover it.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2018-12-11T06:42:22Z","updated_at":"2018-12-11T07:10:48Z","closed_at":"2018-12-11T07:10:43Z","merged_at":"2018-12-11T07:10:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"acfc86f1ad036f0e0198a04b4cb7bcf9608045f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2941/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2941/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2941/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5c017ab9bb2226e4473d68acb57305b09b35c452","head":{"label":"beiwei30:telnet-invoke-ismatch","ref":"telnet-invoke-ismatch","sha":"5c017ab9bb2226e4473d68acb57305b09b35c452","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"795a84005fb86a6fc3649810807624e39e3bdd5c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

目的\r\n 简化，重构现有dubbo 初始化逻辑和与spring 集成繁杂代码\r\n\r\n二 设计思路 \r\n  1.将Dubbo XXXConfig简化为POJO, Dubbo相关配置用初始化完全可以抽象成Bean,交给Spring 完成初始化(后期也可以维护DubboBeanFactory)\r\n 2.将Bean 暴露和远程Bean 引入单独为相应的模块SPI,将暴露和引入逻辑抽象成单独类和方法,不应该参杂在Config中\r\n3.废弃DubboBeanDefinitionParser，DubboNamespaceHandler,Dubbo各种配置,本质也是Bean,只是在初始化完成后需要进一步处理,可抽扩展点ServiceExporter，ServiceImporter来实现\r\n4 部署\r\n  应该将Dubbo初始化维在Dubbo内部，后期可设计Dubbo自己的BeanFactory,不依赖Spring时，只需要修改扩展点ServiceExporter，ServiceImporter\r\n\r\n三 调整内容\r\n    1.  引入扩展点ServiceExporter，ServiceImporter\r\n

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-11T06:13:20Z","updated_at":"2018-12-13T01:26:18Z","closed_at":"2018-12-11T09:09:37Z","merged_at":"2018-12-11T09:09:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"0599f7da8bfeea08de0b5d2c7699a10a3c62b8ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2939/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2939/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2939/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5f1e2fbbdfad39046fc63f04ab245578d94ed253","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:master_deleteAssignments","ref":"master_deleteAssignments","sha":"5f1e2fbbdfad39046fc63f04ab245578d94ed253","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImprove several places of map iteration\r\n\r\nIn `JavaBeanSerializeUtil.java`, `Menu.java`, `DefaultFuture.java` and several Test cases,\r\nwe have some code similar to\r\n```\r\nfor (Key key : map.KeySet()) {\r\n  Value value = map.get(key);\r\n  ......\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThis pr will replace it using `entrySet()` \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nsource code and test code updated\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nut passwd\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-11T05:51:49Z","updated_at":"2018-12-12T06:39:59Z","closed_at":"2018-12-12T06:23:59Z","merged_at":"2018-12-12T06:23:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"227a1699ac041b9e99e31ba3dfcff5d2307ee77b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2938/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2938/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2938/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/768023e293453e396d1ec0bd62ba9241fb99e1ce","head":{"label":"biyuhao:improve-map-iteration","ref":"improve-map-iteration","sha":"768023e293453e396d1ec0bd62ba9241fb99e1ce","user":{"login":"biyuhao","id":1197310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTczMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1197310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao","html_url":"https://github.com/biyuhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":146312405,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDYzMTI0MDU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"biyuhao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"biyuhao","id":1197310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTczMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1197310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao","html_url":"https://github.com/biyuhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/biyuhao/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis patch can standardize semantics of all mergers :  merge arguments can be null , and all the others should have same type . \r\n\r\nFor ArrayMerger , as its argument type is  Object[]... items ,  so we can avoid checking whether item[i] is\r\nan Array . Also , in order to avoid problems like \r\n```\r\n        class Person{};\r\n        class Teacher extends Person{};\r\n        Person[] a= {new Person()};\r\n        Teacher[] b= {new Teacher()};\r\n        Object[] result = ArrayMerger.INSTANCE.merge(a,b);\r\n```\r\nwe can require all elements to have the same type , al least the user should pass in the same type\r\n\r\nFor MergerFactory , if the required class is not in cache , we can throw an user friendly Exception \r\n\r\nFor test case , I add some exception case , and fix an ArrayMerger case , also add some null argument\r\ntest case . \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-10T00:00:27Z","updated_at":"2018-12-11T09:12:19Z","closed_at":"2018-12-11T09:12:19Z","merged_at":"2018-12-11T09:12:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"ce4defa5a0b83af9fcc40bb063c2c2b5c81c8d28","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2929/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2929/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2929/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d7f5a9d9cb310b0b83e6a81e625be12069e71b79","head":{"label":"igor-suhorukov:master","ref":"master","sha":"d7f5a9d9cb310b0b83e6a81e625be12069e71b79","user":{"login":"igor-suhorukov","id":10332206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzMyMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10332206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/igor-suhorukov","html_url":"https://github.com/igor-suhorukov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igor-suhorukov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igor-suhorukov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igor-suhorukov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igor-suhorukov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igor-suhorukov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igor-suhorukov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igor-suhorukov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igor-suhorukov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igor-suhorukov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"107a0cc11ac8fa38986025bb7adec700d5c65482","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\nI have noticed that [dubbo's Documentation](https://dubbo.incubator.apache.org/en-us/docs/user/references/xml/dubbo-protocol.html) says there is a telnet config in protocol to config Supported telnet commands,but it seems does not work,Let's make it work again.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nmake telnet work again.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

is shutting down。\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-07T09:53:35Z","updated_at":"2018-12-10T15:16:45Z","closed_at":"2018-12-10T08:19:20Z","merged_at":"2018-12-10T08:19:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"38c2151857ca5af1adbf739b82768ac2514824a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2917/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2917/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2917/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/203985624b1ec4ba3f70f9f7b62e4b551dd8a1bf","head":{"label":"gudegg:fix_ci","ref":"fix_ci","sha":"203985624b1ec4ba3f70f9f7b62e4b551dd8a1bf","user":{"login":"gudegg","id":13344666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQ0NjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13344666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg","html_url":"https://github.com/gudegg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":150834463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTA4MzQ0NjM=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"gudegg/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gudegg","id":13344666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQ0NjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13344666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg","html_url":"https://github.com/gudegg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gudegg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gudegg/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

The change makes a similar patch as in #2741 to these other tests to close opened ports and servers.\r\n\r\n## Brief

change\r\n\r\nrun unit tests\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues/2899\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nGraceful shutdown enhancement in Spring.\r\n\r\nAbstractConfig has added a DubboShutdownHook  in  its constructed function，but when we used spring, SpringExtensionFactory also added a ApplicationListener  to invoke DubboShutdownHook when spring fired ContextClosedEvent.\r\n\r\nThis seems to have  a problem。  AbstractConfig‘s DubboShutdownHook  will invoke when the application shutdown,  at the same time spring boot shutDownhook will invoke  to close the context。\r\n\r\nwhen the application closing ，dubbo will make sure all the request has return ，if a request used bean in spring ， this bean will close by context。 it will throw error，so in spring ，we should  make  sure dubbo shutdown before  spring  destory its beans。\r\n\r\n我怕我英文没有表达清楚，用中文简单描述一下。正好也在解决这个问题，当我的应用在使用spring boot 时，spring boot 会注册一个shutdownhook 来关闭 applicationcontext ，同时 Dubbo 也会注册 shutdownhook， 但是我们没办法保证两个shutdownhook的执行顺序。因为dubbo 的优雅停机 会把已经进来的请求处理完，当这些请求依赖spring 的某些bean 时，这些bean 可能已经被spring 容器关闭了，产生了报错。我们应该确保dubbo完全停机了再关闭spring容器。\r\n我目前的做法是取消了spring boot 注册的shutdownhook， 自己实现了一个shutdownhook ，运行时，先sleep（DEFAULT_SERVER_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT），再确保dubbo 停机后再关闭容器，如果 DEFAULT_SERVER_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT 过大的话，可能会拖延停机时间，这也是为什么我提了一个issue ：https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues/2877 。\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nwhen  add  ShutdownHookListener ，remove    AbstractConfig‘s DubboShutdownHook\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-05T07:40:39Z","updated_at":"2018-12-05T07:42:53Z","closed_at":"2018-12-05T07:42:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9044b4f454f4c8d91996dc4b078b6b3d0b613fdc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2888/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2888/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2888/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/fbe2ace40fed542922ae8ec3209d8cb1523c8c4e","head":{"label":"shengjunzhao:master","ref":"master","sha":"fbe2ace40fed542922ae8ec3209d8cb1523c8c4e","user":{"login":"shengjunzhao","id":21152612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTUyNjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21152612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengjunzhao","html_url":"https://github.com/shengjunzhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengjunzhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengjunzhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengjunzhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengjunzhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengjunzhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengjunzhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengjunzhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengjunzhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengjunzhao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":99550582,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5OTU1MDU4Mg==","name":"dubbo","full_name":"shengjunzhao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shengjunzhao","id":21152612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTUyNjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21152612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengjunzhao","html_url":"https://github.com/shengjunzhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengjunzhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengjunzhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengjunzhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengjunzhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengjunzhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengjunzhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengjunzhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengjunzhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shengjunzhao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shengjunzhao/dubbo","description":":loudspeaker:

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-05T05:31:02Z","updated_at":"2018-12-11T03:56:21Z","closed_at":"2018-12-06T09:48:20Z","merged_at":"2018-12-06T09:48:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"585b3a5c4cee72dc0a597cef22bce83cd2df2d52","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2887/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2887/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2887/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a582c961530c36484efc5740a24aaf5653c88cbf","head":{"label":"beiwei30:issue2850","ref":"issue2850","sha":"a582c961530c36484efc5740a24aaf5653c88cbf","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1f751a602654f52d1ea86488a66d56c2a8faced6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nadd ScriptRouter test case\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n/dubbo-cluster/src/test/java/org/apache/dubbo/rpc/cluster/router/script/ScriptRouterTest.java\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nadd test testRouteHostFilter and testRoute_throwException, all of them passed\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2018-12-04T04:07:23Z","updated_at":"2018-12-04T07:30:57Z","closed_at":"2018-12-04T07:30:57Z","merged_at":"2018-12-04T07:30:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"1f751a602654f52d1ea86488a66d56c2a8faced6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2879/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2879/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2879/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/08330d1ce4b407b22c0b5c66bbc6079526f83904","head":{"label":"lixiaojiee:master","ref":"master","sha":"08330d1ce4b407b22c0b5c66bbc6079526f83904","user":{"login":"lixiaojiee","id":34837528,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0ODM3NTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34837528?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee","html_url":"https://github.com/lixiaojiee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d0f7c05abb54f02584587a41d19636c35d3d9ab2","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.
