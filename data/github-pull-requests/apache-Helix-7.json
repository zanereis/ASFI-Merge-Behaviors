screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nMaintenance Management service fails silently when user provided OperationInterface returns null in take/freeInstance API.\r\nWe should allow user provided OperationInterface to return null.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nModified TestOperationImpl.java.\r\nTestInstanceAccessor will cover null case.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

efficient `String#contains` in `ZkClientPathMonitor`\r\n- Refactor `record*` methods in `ZkClientMonitor` to avoid repetition and simplify matching logic\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nCovered by existing tests, in particular\r\n- org.apache.helix.zookeeper.impl.client.TestRawZkClient\r\n- org.apache.helix.monitoring.mbeans.TestZkClientMonitor\r\n\r\nThe following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testDisablingTopStateReplicaByDisablingInstance:98

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes  #2018\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis commit adds new concepts:\r\n1. **CloudEventListener**: It represents an event listener, user will need to choose callback from what is available and register their own callback logic to event listener for different types of cloud event.\r\n2. **CloudEventHandler**: It is fundamentally a list of cloud listeners, and is meant to provide convenience for users for registering listeners. Within Helix usage, users can register multiple event listeners to the event handler. So when registering listeners to the cloud platform, users just need to register this CloudEventHandler object, which means the listeners that are previously registered to this event handler are registered  to the cloud platform all at once.\r\n\r\nThis commits also embeds the cloud event handling logic into HelixManager. More specifically, ZKHelixManager can be populated with a cloud event listener if user defines it in **CloudEventCallbackProperty** which is nested inside HelixCloudProperty and HelixManagerProperty. CloudEventCallbackProperty not only allows users to choose from Helix-provided callback methods, as well as override them with user specific logics, but also users can supply their callback logic and specify the order that the callbacks will be triggered (before  or after Helix-supported callback).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestCloudEventCallbackProperty\r\nTestDefaultCloudEventCallbackImpl\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n**CI all tests passed.**\r\n\r\nResults from local run:\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1307, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 6,442.479 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1307, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #1982\r\n\r\nDue to logical change in ZKHelixManager constructor in a [previous commit](https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/1986), TestCloudEventCallbackProperty broke because in this test it doesn't connect to zookeeper server.\r\nTo fix this test, we separated MockCloudEventAwareHelixManager （previously called MockEventAwareZKHelixManager, nested inside TestCloudEventCallbackProperty）into a class, and include all and only the logics related to cloud events in MockCloudEventAwareHelixManager. More detailed, we mock a cloud config object retrieved from zk to bypass connection to zk.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nModified: TestCloudEventCallbackProperty\r\nAdded: MockCloudEventAwareHelixManager\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n\r\nDefault Suite\r\nTotal tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Skips: 0\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #1980 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n#### Overview\r\n\r\nFix failing test TestDropResourceMetricsReset\r\n\r\nA recent ZK version bump reveals a seemingly long-hidden code issue regarding resource metrics. It's possible the test never works in the expected way. \r\n\r\n#### What\r\nIs it a faulty test or a code issue we should fix?\r\n-- More ideas welcome! \r\nAs of now we believe it's a code issue and need a fix, please also see https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/2011#issuecomment-1087807581\r\n\r\n#### Why\r\nThe test failure could be reproduced stably using **either ZK version** by adding Thread.sleep() between `participant.syncStop()` and `setupTool.dropResourceFromCluster`. So this indicates the test was wrong (and succeeded in a wrong way) for a while, there are race condition and zk version change introduce unrelated delay that finally reveal the issue.\r\n\r\nmBean is only unregistered during ExternalViewComputeStage in https://github.com/apache/helix/blob/master/helix-core/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/controller/stages/ExternalViewComputeStage.java#L99.\r\n It's not always happening after the resource is dropped as there is no `CurrentStateChange` event anymore, only `IdealStateChange`. \r\n\r\n#### How\r\n\r\nFixing the issue itself requires more changes and careful design. We'd want to first put a temp workaround for the test case by manually triggering a cluster event.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-01T23:16:29Z","updated_at":"2022-04-05T17:41:45Z","closed_at":"2022-04-05T17:41:44Z","merged_at":"2022-04-05T17:41:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"ed9e3cb408b24644279c07cbcde4e56ac6d2dd06","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2011/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2011/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2011/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/e8c81f2864665775500fb9b09f5c21c31eed0422","head":{"label":"qqu0127:resource-metrics-test","ref":"resource-metrics-test","sha":"e8c81f2864665775500fb9b09f5c21c31eed0422","user":{"login":"qqu0127","id":19682637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjgyNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19682637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127","html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":444938840,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoU6WA","name":"helix","full_name":"qqu0127/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"qqu0127","id":19682637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjgyNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19682637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127","html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#2000 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nHaving a batching enable/disable would reduce number of ZK write. It is also helps user to solve some race conditions as all instance enabling/disabling happens at one ZNode.\r\n\r\nHelix already have a batch instance enable/disable feature but it is inactive now. This PR active this feature as the dependency is resolved. Helix should also allow user to set disabled type and reason for these instances.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nEnabled :\r\nTestBatchEnableInstances\r\nExtended :\r\nTestBatchEnableInstances.testBatchDisableOldEnable\r\n\r\nThe following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2022-04-01T01:23:24.9058547Z [ERROR] Failures: \r\n2022-04-01T01:23:24.9064922Z [ERROR]   TestDropResourceMetricsReset.testDropWithNoCurrentState:153 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n2022-04-01T01:23:24.9068390Z [ERROR] Tests run: 1301, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: \r\n```\r\nKnown issue: #1980 \r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-31T23:42:52Z","updated_at":"2022-04-12T21:16:46Z","closed_at":"2022-04-06T01:34:50Z","merged_at":"2022-04-06T01:34:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"858038a0d4393109f3dfbb63c2f442b0f95fa50e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2006/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2006/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2006/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/84fc9a66e1b8cb1f374f5a2efa399806bfabc65b","head":{"label":"xyuanlu:clusterConfigmst","ref":"clusterConfigmst","sha":"84fc9a66e1b8cb1f374f5a2efa399806bfabc65b","user":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260321741,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAzMjE3NDE=","name":"helix","full_name":"xyuanlu/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1985\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis is a fix based on a previous [PR](https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/1986). The previous PR retrieves cloud config from zk and replace entire HelixCloudProperty object, which may cause some fields that user pass in in HelixCloudProperty that are not  included in cloud config get missing. This commit changes the logic to only populate fields in HelixCloudProperty with values that are present in cloud config, and leave other fields unchanged.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestMultiZkHelixJavaApis.testZKHelixManagerCloudConfig\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[info] ./helix-core/target/surefire-reports/TestSuite.txt: Tests run: 1296, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5,863.791 s - in TestSuite\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-31T21:05:57Z","updated_at":"2022-04-06T00:28:09Z","closed_at":"2022-04-05T17:13:01Z","merged_at":"2022-04-05T17:13:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"9c70bb0bce59cfd49e0bdaf3be6f5131331f61b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2005/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2005/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2005/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/d986565481e61853670ccd5f30cd3cde9814bc9c","head":{"label":"mgao0:cloudConfig","ref":"cloudConfig","sha":"d986565481e61853670ccd5f30cd3cde9814bc9c","user":{"login":"mgao0","id":31704180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzA0MTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31704180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0","html_url":"https://github.com/mgao0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":233714042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzM3MTQwNDI=","name":"helix","full_name":"mgao0/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mgao0","id":31704180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzA0MTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31704180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0","html_url":"https://github.com/mgao0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgao0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mgao0/helix","description":"Mirror

screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nTestClusterInMaintenanceModeWhenReachingOfflineInstancesLimit is failing because of a race condition:\r\nThe cluster is set to enter MM when >4 instances are offline. In the test, the cluster is manually exit MM mode.\r\nIt is possible that when cluster manually exit MM, pipeline cache still has old data and thinks there are >4 instances disabled, so it auto enter MM.\r\n\r\nFix it to add a config to auto exit MM when there are no disabled instances.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestClusterInMaintenanceModeWhenReachingOfflineInstancesLimit.testWithOfflineInstancesLimit\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nCI result: TestDropResourceMetricsReset.testDropWithNoCurrentState:153 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\nExisting issue: #1980 \r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#1985 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nHelix user notice that when ZooScalability is enabled, property configured helix cloud participant could not auto register in cluster. This is because when ZooScalability is enabled, Helix need user to pass a cloudConfig object when initiating ZkHelixManager. When user did not set cloudConfig, it will cause nullptr error when reading cloudConfig in ParticipantManager.autoJoin().\r\nThis change reads cloudConfig from Zookeeper in ZkHelixManager constructor and propagate to HelixManagerProperty in ZkHelixManager constructor.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1973\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWith the upgrade of apache zookeeper version, snappy-java was missing in the dependency. This commit adds snappy-java and removes unused imports in osgi declaration. Also, using ZooKeeper 3.5.9 in zookeeper-api instead because 3.6.0+ causes some tests to fail in zookeeper-api.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-10T20:20:12Z","updated_at":"2022-03-12T23:22:22Z","closed_at":"2022-03-12T23:22:22Z","merged_at":"2022-03-12T23:22:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"cbf35baa22a90a75470921726eb2e0417a6e0123","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1977/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1977/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1977/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/e7bee2f676416563ae2fa864fe8620c6eaf96cee","head":{"label":"narendly:zk_version_fix","ref":"zk_version_fix","sha":"e7bee2f676416563ae2fa864fe8620c6eaf96cee","user":{"login":"narendly","id":10107095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTA3MDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10107095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly","html_url":"https://github.com/narendly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":126890023,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjY4OTAwMjM=","name":"helix","full_name":"narendly/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"narendly","id":10107095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTA3MDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10107095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly","html_url":"https://github.com/narendly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/narendly/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1966 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAs the first step of protecting Helix REST endpoints, we're adding authorization components, such as filters and validator interfaces to helix-rest. Users will be able to implement validators and register them to HelixRestServer, which would use these validators to reject unauthorized accesses. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestAuthValidator\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-23T00:47:10Z","updated_at":"2022-02-24T02:51:42Z","closed_at":"2022-02-24T02:51:42Z","merged_at":"2022-02-24T02:51:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"ac9680a8450ffc14f048e324782ce8f037d28fb6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1967/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1967/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1967/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/810d2eb1c1b7e07ed81a3b543137e5c03e1c1655","head":{"label":"NealSun96:nealsun/helix-rest-authorization-components","ref":"nealsun/helix-rest-authorization-components","sha":"810d2eb1c1b7e07ed81a3b543137e5c03e1c1655","user":{"login":"NealSun96","id":18000949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAwOTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18000949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96","html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":233725825,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzM3MjU4MjU=","name":"helix","full_name":"NealSun96/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NealSun96","id":18000949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAwOTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18000949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96","html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCode cleanup is a basic hygiene and great way to learn about code. Starting with finding some dead-code. I have searched within our code base and no one is using this method. I am hoping that in-general community is also not using this.\r\n\r\nPlease review it carefully and confirm.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nNo test fails\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\nThis is a public method of - helix/helix-core/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/controller/HelixControllerMain.java\r\n\r\nmethod signature is: public static void addListenersToController(HelixManager manager,  GenericHelixController controller)\r\n\r\nPlease do look at and see if there are any consumers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-17T17:03:02Z","updated_at":"2022-02-18T18:33:14Z","closed_at":"2022-02-18T18:32:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bd992f3f3a87028cdf7286641f214542863bd4f8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1964/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1964/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1964/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/82ba4d26db145e9bdb1e0a778de98997689b32e2","head":{"label":"desaikomal:kdesai/code-cleanup","ref":"kdesai/code-cleanup","sha":"82ba4d26db145e9bdb1e0a778de98997689b32e2","user":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":452080859,"node_id":"R_kgDOGvI02w","name":"helix","full_name":"desaikomal/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal/helix","description":"Mirror

Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe introduce the REST endpoint for virtual topology group at `clusters/{}` with command `addVirtualTopologyGroup`. \r\nIt invokes the java endpoint introduced in https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/1935.\r\nIt's expected to be called every time we setup or change virtual topology group, or adding new instances to the cluster.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNew tests in `TestClusterAccessor`\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#1938\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nHelix log some error message related to state transition handling to ZNode and there is a log before writing to ZNode. Thie change removes duplicated log.\r\nThere is already log at the caller with enough message, no need to log again.\r\nEventually we want to get rid of writing error messages to ZNode as well.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nAN\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-03T21:34:37Z","updated_at":"2022-04-12T21:20:17Z","closed_at":"2022-02-07T23:07:16Z","merged_at":"2022-02-07T23:07:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"a347d0f2316e3e4a03ca47ee16c493a94e336142","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1955/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1955/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1955/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/7af81e697c786e00b0b93b0dcf4f253282eea629","head":{"label":"xyuanlu:codeClean","ref":"codeClean","sha":"7af81e697c786e00b0b93b0dcf4f253282eea629","user":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260321741,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAzMjE3NDE=","name":"helix","full_name":"xyuanlu/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu/helix","description":"Mirror

#1953\r\n\r\n### Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#1953 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhere possible, logging calls are changed so that logging framework handles exception formatting instead of stack trace being manually formatted using `Throwable#getStackTrace`\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nLogging only change, no tests\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-03T20:32:44Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T21:41:35Z","closed_at":"2022-02-03T21:35:05Z","merged_at":"2022-02-03T21:35:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"3e6dd3ecbfdaf97d245c7317b7e25c9ff8bc83d3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1954/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1954/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1954/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/e2ba3b7a5e361df42e905d910c43ec0d384f968b","head":{"label":"hmhagberg:hmhagberg-stacktrace-log","ref":"hmhagberg-stacktrace-log","sha":"e2ba3b7a5e361df42e905d910c43ec0d384f968b","user":{"login":"hmhagberg","id":5211550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTE1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5211550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmhagberg","html_url":"https://github.com/hmhagberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmhagberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmhagberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmhagberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmhagberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmhagberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmhagberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmhagberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmhagberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmhagberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":448849975,"node_id":"R_kgDOGsDoNw","name":"helix","full_name":"hmhagberg/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hmhagberg","id":5211550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTE1NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5211550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmhagberg","html_url":"https://github.com/hmhagberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmhagberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmhagberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmhagberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmhagberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmhagberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmhagberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmhagberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmhagberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hmhagberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hmhagberg/helix","description":"Mirror

messages intended for instances that are no longer in the cluster\r\n### Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1802 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn MessageGenerationPhase.java, - process() method populates the list of live instances from cache.\r\n\r\nBut while generateMessage() method has the sessionIdMap information, it still goes through partition/resource/instance map without checking if instance is still part of the cluster or not. \r\n\r\nIt is possible that cache has stale entry but that logic needs to be worked separately. But while generating message, we should check if the instance is still there. \r\n\r\nSo this is a simple change. We need to still look further if cache is getting invalidated properly.\r\n\r\nTo make sure that the cache properly is handled/refreshed under instance being replaced or deletion - have filled another bug: https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/1956\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1287, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- This is a simple bug fix and no APIs have been modified.\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-31T21:02:28Z","updated_at":"2022-02-07T23:24:14Z","closed_at":"2022-02-07T23:06:57Z","merged_at":"2022-02-07T23:06:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"192779276eda1a3336525a07ae823003172fcc9e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1951/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1951/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1951/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/3ab12fd6739be5504fb1c6bb8e705fbd45ed35f6","head":{"label":"desaikomal:kdesai-1802","ref":"kdesai-1802","sha":"3ab12fd6739be5504fb1c6bb8e705fbd45ed35f6","user":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":452080859,"node_id":"R_kgDOGvI02w","name":"helix","full_name":"desaikomal/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal/helix","description":"Mirror

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThere is a wrong condition which will never log the error message.\r\n\r\nFixed the condition by populating the partition information with ERROR state.\r\n\r\nEarlier condition: \r\n    if (!partitionsWithErrorStateReplica.isEmpty()) {\r\n      LogUtil.logInfo(logger, _eventId,\r\n          String.format(\"Partition currently has an ERROR replica in %s partitions: %s\",\r\n              resourceName, partitionsWithErrorStateReplica));\r\n    }\r\nThe partitionsWithErrorStateReplica was never populated as a result we were never logging the error message.\r\nThe error message will now populate the resource/partition information appropriately.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/issues/1946\r\nAny of the following keywords can be used: close, closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves, resolved)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nA refactoring for virtual group project.\r\nWe found a need to reference class ClusterTopologyConfig outside of the scope of controller or rebalancer. Thus we refactor it out to a separate class and do some cleanup. This should be backward compatible.\r\n\r\nWe move ClusterTopologyConfig from nested to a standalone class in helix/model and to be used by virtual topology group logic. Some code refactor and cleanup are included.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nAdd new UT class TestClusterTopologyConfig\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nTest helix-core:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1287, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5,462.237 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1287, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1942\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR determines if a ZK write request is compressed by calling GZipCompressionUtil. This is an indirect method and can be inaccurate. So the decision is based on trade-offs.\r\nAlternatively, the ZkClientMonitor can be passed into the serializer class and then report compressed write internally. However, this will require multiple changes in the serializer interfaces.\r\nDue to the multiple layers (PathBasedZkSerializer, ZkSerializer) of serializer interfaces definition, it would be very costly to implement the alternative without major refactoring.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestEnableCompression.java\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nImplement the java endpoint for adding virtual topology group for a cluster. The entry point is `VirtualTopologyGroupService#addVirtualTopologyGroup`.\r\nThis provides a virtualization layer on top of physical fault zones, so that we have more control over the topology on cloud environment where change or override may not be supported. This virtualization layer doesn't provide more fault tolerance, but allows more flexibility in zone topology setup.\r\n\r\nThis API is only expected to be invoked in cloud environment where `cloudConfig.isCloudEnabled()` is true. It's not designed for and not supported for on-prem environment.\r\n\r\n#### What the java API does:\r\n`void addVirtualTopologyGroup(String clusterName, Map<String, String> customFields)`\r\n\r\n- **Validation**\r\n\r\nBasic validation on input params, state check (isCloudEnabled, isTopologyAwareEnabled)\r\n\r\n- **Compute virtual group assignment**\r\n\r\nFrom current cluster topology, compute the virtual group assignment based on given params.\r\n\r\n- **Ensure maintenance mode**\r\n\r\nEnsure the cluster is in maintenance mode before next steps, either service enters it or user specifies to control it themselves outside the API lifecycle.\r\n\r\n- **Update configs**\r\n\r\nOverride cluster topology and fault zone type configs.\r\nUpdate all instance configs by adding `virtualZone` field in the domain.\r\n \r\nSome previous PRs for reference:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/pull/1945\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/pull/1948 \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n`TestVirtualTopologyGroupService`\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 198, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 227.077 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 198, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-rest ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/qqu/workspace/qqu-helix/helix-rest/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Restful Interface' with 87 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  03:51 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2022-02-03T13:39:34-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-14T22:56:58Z","updated_at":"2022-02-08T21:53:40Z","closed_at":"2022-02-08T21:53:40Z","merged_at":"2022-02-08T21:53:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"95b3113be4ca269fff3265bd43c75fb22039cdb2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1935/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1935/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1935/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/17eb006c8bc56423892ea940440329dba0065565","head":{"label":"qqu0127:virtual-group","ref":"virtual-group","sha":"17eb006c8bc56423892ea940440329dba0065565","user":{"login":"qqu0127","id":19682637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjgyNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19682637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127","html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":444938840,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoU6WA","name":"helix","full_name":"qqu0127/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"qqu0127","id":19682637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjgyNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19682637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127","html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqu0127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/qqu0127/helix","description":"Mirror

Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

dependency to Zookeeper in the ivy file in zookeeper-api module.\r\n\r\n### Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1925 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR declares dependency to Zookeeper in the ivy file of the zookeeper-api module. Since zookeeper-api needs classes from Zookeeper, the absence of this dependency in the ivy file causes compilation error on some systems. By adding this dependency, the compilation error is resolved.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nNo changes to the code were made.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-04T01:15:41Z","updated_at":"2022-01-05T19:45:54Z","closed_at":"2022-01-05T19:45:54Z","merged_at":"2022-01-05T19:45:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"9c5946bc077b1ead87666a7f962764eb307016cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1926/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1926/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1926/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/c07cc91de858acd86e711d388c7b23f81b4d211a","head":{"label":"rabashizade:master","ref":"master","sha":"c07cc91de858acd86e711d388c7b23f81b4d211a","user":{"login":"rabashizade","id":67170754,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MTcwNzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67170754?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabashizade","html_url":"https://github.com/rabashizade","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabashizade/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabashizade/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabashizade/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabashizade/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabashizade/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabashizade/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabashizade/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabashizade/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabashizade/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":274207201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzQyMDcyMDE=","name":"helix","full_name":"rabashizade/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rabashizade","id":67170754,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MTcwNzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67170754?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabashizade","html_url":"https://github.com/rabashizade","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabashizade/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabashizade/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabashizade/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabashizade/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabashizade/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabashizade/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabashizade/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabashizade/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabashizade/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rabashizade/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1921 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAs referenced in the original issue, Log4j has been the subject of multiple critical vulnerabilities.  The latest advice is to abandon Log4j 1.x and Log4j <= 2.15 in favor of Log4j 2.16.0 which reliability patches these issues.  See https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/apache-log4j-vulnerability-guidance.\r\n\r\nIn the context of Helix, this involved a few things:\r\n- Replacing the `slf4j-log4j12` v1.7.14 package with the `log4j-to-slf4j` package v2.16.0\r\n- Upgrading SLF4J API to v.1.7.32 (latest) from v1.7.25\r\n- Adding the `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` Java VM flag to all CLI tools (while not strictly necessary in v2.16.0, it's a second failsafe)\r\n- Removing the unused `org.apache.helix.tools.CLMLogFileAppender` class (the only place CLMLogFileAppender is referenced is in Log4j properties files and from a different package than this one). Custom appenders look way different in Log4j2.\r\n- `org.slf4j.slf4j-simple` was added to test dependencies in a few places to remove errors with the SLF4J factory not being found\r\n- `helix-core` specifically needed `log4j-core` added as well to provide an actual logging implementation to back SLF4J\r\n- `org.apache.helix.zookeeper.zkclient.ZkServer` was updated to change a direct Log4j 1.x reference to use SLF4J\r\n- In `zookeeper-api` the `org.apache.zookeeper` dependency was updated with exclusion rules on SLF4J and Log4J because it was still pulling in the old vulnerable versions.  As far as I'm aware, Zookeeper hasn't issued a patch yet.\r\n\r\nThis ended up rippling out into more places than I expected, partly due to the Zookeeper dependency still bringing in vulnerable versions and partly due to a few places in code referencing Log4j 1.x APIs/packages/classes directly.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nI ran all the tests (results below), though the `helix-core` seems to not be able to make it all the way to the end of the test run without running into \"Out of Memory\" errors on my Mac.  I think I need some external verification to make sure that's just my machine and not an actual issue with the library upgrade.\r\n\r\nI'm planning on deploying a freshly built Helix controller to one of our test environments to try to verify everything else still looks ok.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmetrics-common\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ metrics-common ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/bnash/code/helix-cve-fork/metrics-common/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Metrics Common' with 8 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  4.904 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-12-16T09:47:33-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nmetadata-store-directory-common\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 31, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ metadata-store-directory-common ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/bnash/code/helix-cve-fork/metadata-store-directory-common/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Metadata Store Directory Common' with 7 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  15.906 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-12-16T09:53:18-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nzookeeper-api\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 54, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ zookeeper-api ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/bnash/code/helix-cve-fork/zookeeper-api/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: ZooKeeper API' with 115 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  10:26 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-12-16T09:46:11-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nrecipes\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ service-discovery ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/bnash/code/helix-cve-fork/recipes/service-discovery/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Recipes :: service discovery' with 8 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Reactor Summary for Apache Helix :: Recipes 1.0.3-SNAPSHOT:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Apache Helix :: Recipes ............................

They include:\r\n\r\nNothing breaks a user-facing API as far as I'm aware, however, developers should emphasize relying on SLF4J APIs rather than Log4j ones to keep the necessary abstraction in place.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#1903\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nUser will hit a 500 error when passing the following input to stoppable API.\r\n`instance_name/stoppable -d '{\"customized_values\": {\"keys\" : \"cc\"}}'` or\r\n`instance_name/stoppable -d '{}'`\r\n\r\nReason:\r\n\r\n```\r\nString customizedInput = null;                 <------------- <1>\r\nif (node.get(InstancesAccessor.InstancesProperties.customized_values.name()) != null) {\r\n  customizedInput = node.get(InstancesAccessor.InstancesProperties.customized_values.name()).textValue();   <<<----- <2>\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is shared code that reads user input Json payload.\r\n\r\n<1> is the cause of this problem. If there is no \"customized_values\" defined in the payload, \"customizedInput\" will be null and cause nullptr exception.\r\n\r\n<2> is another problem we have. JsonNode.textValue() will only convert Textual value this node contains, iff it is a textual JSON node (comes from JSON String value entry). (https://fasterxml.github.io/jackson-databind/javadoc/2.7/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/JsonNode.html#textValue()).\r\n\r\nIt will return null is user provide a KV map, witch is a container node instead of a textual node. We should use toString() here.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nNA\r\nWe already have test that has empty(no customized_values key)/non-empty(customized_values has {k:v} values) input. The test will fail after refactor PR #1902. No new test need to be added. \r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 179, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 412.328 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 179, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-rest ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/xialu/Documents/WorkSpace/helix/helix-rest/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Restful Interface' with 83 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  06:58 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-11-16T16:41:05-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1616\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAdd separate ZK serializer configuration to active ZNRecord compression even the node size is smaller than the write size limit.\r\n\r\nThe property zk.serializer.znrecord.auto-compress.threshold.bytes defines a threshold of ZNRecord size in bytes that the ZK serializer starts to auto compress the ZNRecord for write requests if its size exceeds the threshold.\r\nIf the threshold is not configured or exceed ZKRecord write size limit, default value zk.serializer.znrecord.write.size.limit.bytes (if configured) or 1MB (if no configuration) will be applied.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestZNRecordSizeLimit\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-04T19:00:48Z","updated_at":"2021-11-04T23:36:22Z","closed_at":"2021-11-04T23:36:22Z","merged_at":"2021-11-04T23:36:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"9c5e9fc9aafed8c65d8d93de4b25ed76d42201ea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1901/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1901/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1901/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/0b7675003335db53f5d2a593431e20501345e040","head":{"label":"jiajunwang:master","ref":"master","sha":"0b7675003335db53f5d2a593431e20501345e040","user":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95248544,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTI0ODU0NA==","name":"helix","full_name":"jiajunwang/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1832 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe test fails randomly. Root cause is the test used a random cluster from the clusters set which has super clusters and task cluster, so the cluster could be a task cluster and then the test fails. Freeze mode does not apply to task framework.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by changing the test cluster name with a fixed name `TestClusters_0`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nRan TestClusterAccessor 50 times.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1869\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe `purgeOfflineInstances` API is used to clean up the instance metadata in ZK that is left by offline instances. The API is only used during special use cases where a large amount of instance metadata is left uncleaned; instance metadata should usually be cleaned up manually. \r\n\r\nAs a cleanup API, `purgeOfflineInstances` has limitations: it cannot handle the case when participantHistory is missing. This is because `purgeOfflineInstances` uses the same underlying code as `dropInstance`. That means after one round of purging, race conditions could write unwanted data (such as messages) back to ZK, and they will never be cleaned up because participantHistory is no longer present. \r\n\r\nThis PR improves the API such that it will also purge any incomplete instance data, such as instance path without InstanceConfig or ParticipantHistory. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nModified TestZkHelixAdmin.testPurgeOfflineInstances\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1283, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5,709.742 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1283, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco-maven-plugin:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /home/nesun/helix/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' with 909 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:35 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-09-10T19:14:54-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1827\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nI have identified the previous failure that we observed in #1853 is caused by the old mockito lib version. After upgrading the mockito version and fixing incompatible test code, the full test suite can pass now.\r\n\r\nThis is PR is still for fixing the test failure. However, mockito upgrade is required or other tests will fail due to the change.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nThis PR is to fix test testMissingTopStateDurationMonitoring\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#1854\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAPI GetIdealAssignmentForFullAuto will return the potential partition assignment regardless of the cluster state. If the cluster is in maintenance mode, this API will returns potential assignment considering the input change.\r\nHowever, GetImmediateAssignmentForWagedFullAuto will honor the cluster state. If the cluster is in maintenance mode, this API will use maintenance rebalancer.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestResourceAssignmentOptimizerAccessor\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-29T23:22:35Z","updated_at":"2021-08-31T22:18:55Z","closed_at":"2021-08-30T18:25:35Z","merged_at":"2021-08-30T18:25:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"52b47197a9ef8bf52a227ce6fdc6e512d161b408","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1855/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1855/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1855/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/5bc2caab5bdd6776b40c5fb6d2cfa1651d444ca0","head":{"label":"xyuanlu:restAPI2","ref":"restAPI2","sha":"5bc2caab5bdd6776b40c5fb6d2cfa1651d444ca0","user":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260321741,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAzMjE3NDE=","name":"helix","full_name":"xyuanlu/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#1851\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nHelix has 2 functions to return potential cluster partition assignment for any cluster state change. getIdealAssignmentForFullAuto for ChrushEd resources and getImmediateAssignmentForWagedFullAuto for Waged resources.\r\nWhen recomputing assignment, getIdealAssignmentForFullAuto will not consider delayed rebalance but getImmediateAssignmentForWagedFullAuto will.\r\nIn rest API partitionAssignment is a single enter point for cluster assignment, it called these 2 functions for different resource types. The behavior is inconsistent for these two.\r\n\r\nThis change disabled delayed rebalance for partitionAssignment. Could add a cluster option to honor delayed rebalance window in the future.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 179, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 208.805 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO]
