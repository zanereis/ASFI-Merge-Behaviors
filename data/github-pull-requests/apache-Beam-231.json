the KafaIO source reader on the worker can't reach the server, Kafka consumer blocks forever inside UnboundedReader.start().

I reported it on Kafka users list here : https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/98cebefacbd65b0d6c6817fe0b5197e26bc60252e72d05fced91e628@%3Cusers.kafka.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\nIt blocks inside Kafka client.

started this PR as an initial attempt to implement the `create table` statement.  The implementation might not be so mature, but I hope this could be a place we can discuss deeper about the create table. I will introduce this PR in the following 3 aspects:\r\n\r\n* MetaStore\r\n* TableProvider\r\n* Grammar\r\n\r\n## MetaStore\r\n\r\nMetastore is responsible for handling the CRUD of table during a session. e.g. create a table, query all tables, query a table by the specified name etc. When a table is created, the table meta info can be persisted by the metastore, but the default `InMemoryMetaStore` will only store the meta info in memory, so it will NOT be persisted, but user can implement the `MetaStore` interface to make a persistent implementation.\r\n\r\nThe table names in MetaStore need to be unique.\r\n\r\n## TableProvider\r\n\r\nThe tables in MetaStore can come from many different sources, the construction of a usable table is the responsibility of a `TableProvider`, TableProvider have the similar interface like `MetaStore`, but it only handles a specific type of table, e.g. `TextTableProvider` only handle text tables, while `KafakaTableProvider` only handle kafka tables.\r\n\r\n## Grammar\r\n\r\nThe grammar for create table is:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE ORDERS(\r\n   ID INT PRIMARY KEY COMMENT 'this is the primary key',\r\n   NAME VARCHAR(127) COMMENT 'this is the name'\r\n)\r\nCOMMENT 'this is the table orders'\r\nLOCATION 'text://home/admin/orders'\r\nTBLPROPERTIES '{\"format\": \"Excel\"}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n`LOCATION` dictates where the data of the table is stored. The scheme of the LOCATION dictate the table type, e.g. in the above example, the table type is `text`, using the table type we can find the corresponding `TextTableProvider` using the ServiceLoader merchanism.\r\n\r\n`TBLPROPERTIES` is used to specify some other properties of the table, in the above example, we specified the format of each line of text file: `Excel`(one variant of CSV format).","created_at":"2017-06-30T16:34:50Z","updated_at":"2017-10-26T12:20:22Z","closed_at":"2017-10-26T12:20:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"808f011de4cf913d9a48a1954e1e881067e5d57c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3481/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3481/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3481/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/3c73f5254e77a8dcfcfa998375cae155213a3a29","head":{"label":"xumingming:BEAM-2528-create-table","ref":"BEAM-2528-create-table","sha":"3c73f5254e77a8dcfcfa998375cae155213a3a29","user":{"login":"xumingming","id":379733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/379733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming","html_url":"https://github.com/xumingming","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":90008711,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MDAwODcxMQ==","name":"beam","full_name":"xumingming/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xumingming","id":379733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/379733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming","html_url":"https://github.com/xumingming","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xumingming/beam","description":"Mirror

we were using ProcessFn.

StatefulDoFnRunner is in the processing path, which means\r\nprocessing-time timers are being dropped when the watermark reaches +Inf\r\n\r\n2. When a pipeline shuts down (for example, when bounded sources shut\r\ndown) Flink will drop any outstanding processing-time timers, meaning\r\nthat that any remaining Restrictions will not be processed.\r\n\r\nThe fix for 1. is to execute the splittable DoFn directly, thereby\r\nbypassing the late data/timer dropping logic.\r\n\r\nThe fix for 2. builds on the fix for 1. and also introduces a \"last\r\nresort\" even-time timer that fires at +Inf and makes sure that any\r\nremaining restrictions are being exhausted.\r\n\r\nR: @jkff Not sure if we wan't to fix it like this or maybe adapt

a PCollection of filenames. Part of the plan at http://s.apache.org/textio-sdf. Current implementation is naive: expands glob, splits each file into 64MB chunks, reads each chunk using existing TextReader code. Pretty trivial, except had to duplicate code for managing compression - but this is tested by adding a ReadAll test to every Read test.\r\n\r\nThis won't advance the watermark very well because the chunks are unordered. However hopefully in streaming pipelines people will be ingesting PCollection's of small-ish files and this won't matter much. And TextIO doesn't report timestamps of elements anyway, so in fact it doesn't matter at all. One of the next steps is to develop also an SDF version of this, and have runners that support SDF use it via an override.\r\n\r\nR: @reuvenlax
