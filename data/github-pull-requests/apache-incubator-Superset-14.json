[history](https://github.com/remix-run/history) from 4.10.1 to 5.3.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/history/releases\">history's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.3.0</h2>\n<p>This release provides support for native ESM consumption of all exports.</p>\n<h2>v5.3.0-pre.0</h2>\n<p>No release notes provided.</p>\n<h2>v5.2.0</h2>\n<h2>🐛 Bug fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a few type declarations and deprecated the following types:\n<ul>\n<li><code>State</code> (now set to <code>unknown</code> which will require consumer type narrowing)</li>\n<li><code>PartialPath</code> (use <code>Partial&lt;Path&gt;</code> instead)</li>\n<li><code>PartialLocation</code> (use <code>Partial&lt;Location&gt;</code> instead)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fixed a regression related to the <code>createPath</code> return value (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/remix-run/history/issues/813\">#813</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>✨ Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We now use statically analyzable CJS exports. This enables named imports in Node ESM scripts (<a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/history/commit/aef6c2b9b5d4a62f20678b0aec16d839d994ea0a\">See the commit</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/history/compare/v5.1.0...v5.2.0\">https://github.com/remix-run/history/compare/v5.1.0...v5.2.0</a></p>\n<h2>v5.1.0</h2>\n<p>Because the prior 5.0.2 release removed the <code>State</code> type parameter from <code>Location</code>, this was technically a breaking change. To correct for this, I'm bumping this as a minor release. It won't affect runtime code, but it may affect your development experience and tests if you were using that parameter.</p>\n<p>The <code>State</code> type export is also restored, so you shouldn't have issues with installing React Router v6.</p>\n<p>Oh, by the way, did you hear we <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases/tag/v6.0.0\">released React Router v6</a>?</p>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/history/compare/v5.0.3...v5.1.0\">https://github.com/remix-run/history/compare/v5.0.3...v5.1.0</a></p>\n<h2>v5.0.3</h2>\n<p>Fixed <code>parsePath</code> adding incorrectly adding <code>search</code></p>\n<h2>v5.0.2</h2>\n<p>Just a couple fixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed search params persisting on redirects</li>\n<li>Changed the <code>location.state</code> type to <code>any</code> and removed the generic on <code>Location</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/history/compare/v5.0.1...v5.0.2\">https://github.com/remix-run/history/compare/v5.0.1...v5.0.2</a></p>\n<h2>v5.0.1</h2>\n<p>This patch release contains a <em>tiny</em> TypeScript update to use the built-in <code>Partial</code> utility for <code>PartialPath</code> and <code>PartialLocation</code>. We always love it when we can ship just a little less code!</p>\n<h2>🙏 Credits</h2>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/liuhanqu\"><code>@​liuhanqu</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/hanquliu\"><code>@​hanquliu</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/chaance\"><code>@​chaance</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/mjackson\"><code>@​mjackson</code></a> for your contributions!</p>\n<h2>v5.0.0</h2>\n<p>Today we are very pleased to announce the stable release of history version 5!</p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Addresses <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/immerjs/immer/issues/1071\">#1071</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/immerjs/immer/commit/53e3203984058b8e5ce81a67b81c60069481c568\">53e3203</a>). Immer 10.x solved slow iteration for plain JS objects. This update applies the same handling to class instances. In cases this makes class instance handling 3 times faster. Note that this slightly modifies the behavior of Immer with classes in obscure corner cases, in ways that match current documentation, but do not match previous behavior. If you run into issues with this release icmw. class instances, use <code>setUseStrictShallowCopy(&quot;class_only&quot;)</code> to revert to the old behavior.

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThere was a bug where the slack recipients weren't getting updated correctly when they changed from v1 name to v2 ids during execution. This also adds slack channels to header logs so that if there is an error of channel_not_found for example, we can check the logs to see which channels were passed in. And lastly I found that the integration tests weren't loading user data, so I fixed that as well. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently users with gamma roles are still able to create roles, This PR is made to fix this as well as add test. Reason why this is happening is due to the instantiation of the `ModelRestAPI` classes happening here https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/blob/2d527aae09eed50fd52c6bf886a2970adb225428/flask_appbuilder/security/sqla/manager.py#L97\r\n\r\nTo fix it we'll just be adding the new security views names to the `ADMIN_ONLY_VIEW_MENUS` List in the manager class\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n```bash\r\n# logged in as GAMMA\r\n$ curl \"http://127.0.0.1:9000/api/v1/security/roles/\" \\\r\n     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \\\r\n     -d $'{\r\n  \"name\": \"new_role\"\r\n}'\r\n>> 201\r\n\r\n$ curl \"http://127.0.0.1:9000/api/v1/security/roles/\" \\\r\n     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \\\r\n     -d $'{\r\n  \"name\": \"new_role\"\r\n}'\r\n>> 403\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. Configure SuperSet to use DB authentication and set `FAB_ADD_SECURITY_API = True`\r\n2. Initialize SuperSet; be sure to add an administrator\r\n3. Launch SuperSet\r\n4. Browse to SuperSet\r\n5. Log in as the administrator\r\n6. Add a new user and grant them only the Gamma role\r\n7. Log out\r\n8. Log in as the new user\r\n9. Browse to the swagger endpoint (/swagger/v1)\r\n10. Find Security Roles\r\n11. Expand POST /api/v1/security/roles\r\n12. Click Try It Out\r\n13. In the Model schema area provide a name for a new role\r\n14. Click Execute\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [X] Has associated

pulled when refreshing permissions during a database update command. However, catalogs might not have the necessary permissions to pull the schema information which is halting the whole process. This PR just catches the error to unblock the database creation and update flow. However, a fix at the db engine level for catalogs must be investigated.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN.A.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe dataset model has a comment that says:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/9487d6c9d6b3231b1bf31752c76fc50066be0014/superset/connectors/sqla/models.py#L1135-L1144\r\n\r\nBut turns out there is an old migration from 2016 that adds the uniqueness constraint to the schema:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/9487d6c9d6b3231b1bf31752c76fc50066be0014/superset/migrations/versions/2016-04-15_08-31_b4456560d4f3_change_table_unique_constraint.py#L36-L38\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of catalogs in [SIP-95](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/22862) this constraint needs to either be updated to include `catalog`, or removed to align with the `SqlaTable` model. In this PR I went with the latter.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes a problem with the layout calculation of the native filters modal when dealing with lengthy columns. It changes the algorithm to use a fixed width when in non-expanded mode to correctly calculate text truncations and avoid an horizontal scroll. When in expanded mode, the default 100% width is applied.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes two problems with the native filters columns:\r\n- There was no clear indication on the UI that the column selector was loading. This is especially problematic for datasets with a high number of columns.\r\n- Because the loading state was not set up correctly, users could wrongfully select columns from a previously loaded dataset.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nDue to the difference between the data of the RDK query and currentData, an issue occurred in SQL Lab where, instead of showing an empty selection due to (permission) errors, the schema and table selector allowed the selection of previous database or schema options.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  data?: T // The latest returned result regardless of hook arg, if present\r\n  currentData?: T // The latest returned result for the current hook arg, if present\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a result, it was possible to combine schema and table selections that do not actually exist, causing errors and potentially confusing users.\r\nThis commit addresses these issues by changing to currentData, ensuring that only results existing in the **strictly** selected database and schema are displayed.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhen the selected database in the SQL editor is removed from the selection, the current implementation shows an empty state screen, making it appear as if all data has been

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nFix a couple issues with the catalog permission check when adding a dataset:\r\n\r\n- When listing catalogs there is an off-by-one error when including catalogs in which the user has schema access. For example, if a database `db` has 2 catalogs, `A` and `B`, if the user has access to the schema `db.A.schema1` we should show catalog `A` in the response from `get_catalogs_accessible_by_user`. The off by one error makes the method return `schema1` instead, which is then discarded because it is not in `{A, B}`.\r\n- When fetching tables, if a catalog is not specified (either because \"Allow changing catalogs\" is disabled, or because the DB doesn't support catalogs) then the schema permission still needs to be built with `catalog or default_catalog`, since we need the catalog name in the built schema permission even if \"Allow changing catalogs\" is disabled, otherwise the schema check will fail.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR is a workaround to a weird bug we've encountered in Trino when adding a physical dataset.\r\n\r\nWhen adding the dataset, Superset calls `get_columns` on the inspector. The Trino driver then does a check to see if the table exists, using `has_table`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/trinodb/trino-python-client/blob/505989a59e93f6319e8b6be89a16f81034a06404/trino/sqlalchemy/dialect.py#L176\r\n\r\nThe `has_table` method runs this query:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n            SELECT \"table_name\"\r\n            FROM \"information_schema\".\"tables\"\r\n            WHERE \"table_schema\" = :schema\r\n              AND \"table_name\" = :table\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here's the weird part: even though the table DOES exist, the query can return nothing. Even weirder: running a `SHOW COLUMNS FROM :schema.:table` in that case returns data.\r\n\r\nThe Trino DB engine spec already has a custom `get_indexes` method with the warning:\r\n\r\n> Trino dialect raises NoSuchTableError in get_indexes if table is empty.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/84a1cd245c8a9477a081e85cd97f6e757dfe9288/superset/db_engine_specs/trino.py#L442-L462\r\n\r\nSo I suspect it's the same problem.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I modified the Trino DB engine spec to first try the `inspector.get_columns` method, which queries the `information_schema.table`. If this fails with `NoSuchTableError` then it falls back to the `SHOW COLUMNS FROM ...` approach.\r\n\r\nThe Presto DB engine spec already implements a `get_columns` that uses `SHOW COLUMNS FROM ...`, so I moved it to `PrestoBaseEngineSpec`, so it can be used both by `PrestoEngineSpec` and `TrinoEngineSpec`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

have a sql statement with length is 17121. I need check **is_read_only_query** \r\n\r\nAs you can see:\r\n\r\n-  **For current ParsedQuery class**:\r\n    Each function in **is_select**, **is_explain**, **is_show** will format sql statement by calling **sqlparse.format** function. But it takes quite long (~**0.332s** for one call). So you need to call **3 times** for checking **is_read_only_query**  --> Total time: **0.9996**s\r\n\r\n- **For new ParsedQuery class**:\r\n     You need to call only **1 time** for checking **is_read_only_query**  --> Total time: **0.3278**s\r\n\r\n   <h4>    ---> Reduce 66% in total time for checking is_read_only_query </4>\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe function `upgrade_catalog_perms` is used to add catalog-related permissions when support for catalogs is introduced in a DB engine spec:\r\n\r\n- #28317 (Postgres)\r\n- #28394 (Databricks)\r\n- #28416 (BigQuery, Presto, Trino)\r\n\r\nThe migration needs to query the analytical databases in order to read the schemas, so that new permissions can be added. It might be possible that during the migration the analytical database is offline, resulting in an exception.\r\n\r\nThis PR wraps the call to `database.get_all_schema_names` in a try/except block, to prevent the migration from failing. If a given database is offline during the migration, the script will read the existing known schemas from `schema_access`, so that the migration can succeed.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis component simplifies some component imports/exports, making it so that ONLY the Superset components use the base AntD components. We should be consolidating on Superset-wrapped AntD components whenever/wherever possible and relevant.\r\n\r\nAlso, this styles the ListViewCard to inherit the AntD theme \"tokens\" for the \"Card\" and adds a pattern to override them when necessary (rather than getting into granular CSS, which adds complexity and might cause future upgrade problems).\r\n\r\nIt also adds an AntD theme provider in Storybook, so all components will automatically be handed the theme.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nTested these components in Storybook and compared to [the public storybook on

slack operation](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/29480)\r\n\r\nI've used very naive approach of simply replacing method calls for 'files_upload', since the method using it has already been marked for deprecation inside Superset.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nSetup Slack Token API-based notification using dashboard.\r\nActually send the notification, instead of receiving API deprecation response from Slack.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: fixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/29480\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [
