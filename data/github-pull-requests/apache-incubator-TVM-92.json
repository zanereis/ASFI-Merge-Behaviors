PR fixes autotvm and the autoscheduler when using multiprocessing's spawn start method. I had to remove all nested function declarations, property serialize auto_scheduler's `SearchTask`, and propagate registries to subprocesses. Unfortunately, the registry propagation does not work correctly when running under pytest. I've disable those tests for now (`tests/python/unittest/test_runtime_rpc.py`), but they work if run directly. Maybe someone else can take a look at this.\r\n\r\nSee #6650 \r\n\r\n@merrymercy

avoid the confusion in #6570, we call `del measure_ctx` earlier in the tutorial, just after we finish the search.\r\n\r\n`measure_ctx` overloads the `__del__`. Ideally, we do not need to call `del measure_ctx` explicitly.\r\nHowever, I found `__del__` only works for local variables.\r\nIf we use `measure_ctx` as a local variable inside a function, it can be garbage-collected correctly.\r\nBut in the tutorial, `measure_ctx` is a global variable. It thus cannot be garbage-collected correctly.\r\n\r\nThere are two solutions to this problem.\r\n**S1**. call `del measure_ctx` explicitly\r\n**S2**. use \r\n```\r\nwith measure_ctx:\r\n  tune_options = ...\r\n  s, args = auto_scheduler.auto_schedule(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think S1 is better. In S1, `del measure_ctx` is only required if `measure_ctx` is a global variable, which is a rare case (but unfortunately, this happens in the tutorial)\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-10T07:37:00Z","updated_at":"2020-10-11T09:51:27Z","closed_at":"2020-10-11T09:51:14Z","merged_at":"2020-10-11T09:51:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"f6657a6b87104eddd1fc46e5ddc490837fadc1b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6660/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6660/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6660/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/0336d90d2deaea8c656a47fd85626d281d820733","head":{"label":"merrymercy:pr-del-measure-ctx","ref":"pr-del-measure-ctx","sha":"0336d90d2deaea8c656a47fd85626d281d820733","user":{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":110390605,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTAzOTA2MDU=","name":"tvm","full_name":"merrymercy/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy/tvm","description":"End

PR adds \"include_non_call_ops\" parameter to AnnotateTarget pass. When set (include_non_call_ops=True) the AnnotateTarget pass will annotate non call ops with default target or with the target of its arguments. This is current behavior of AnnotateTarget pass.  When the flag is set to false (include_non_call_ops=False) the AnnotateTarget pass will not annotate non-call. This behavior is useful if you are not running MergeCompilerRegions pass after AnnotateTarget.\r\n\r\nThe PR related to an issue reported here:

a WIP, posting for people to take a look at. This should maybe become an RFC, happy to write one up. I just needed a `pyproject.toml` for a project I'm working on now so I'm posting it.\r\n\r\nIt's really hard to reproducibly use TVM outside the docker containers, and depending on what hardware you have at work/home (are they different now?), you can't always run the docker container you need to (I.e. ci-gpu). Clearly documenting our python dependencies will help.\r\n\r\nI think *just* checking this in as-is would be bad because:\r\n - I'm just copying dependencies from one place to another. There isn't anything to enforce that our docker images, and therefore our CI, actually uses the selected versions\r\n - That aside, it would be great to generate a constraints file or some other log *outside* the docker images, so that you can have a clear record of e.g. which version of `pylint` is used to lint without needing to pull the container.\r\n - In order to actually use `poetry`, I had to hack `setup.py` to hardcode the library location. Maybe we should just do this. Right now if you have `libtvm_runtime.so` in `PATH` then it just uses that one--very bad in development! The reason for this is that dependency tracking tools installing packages in editable mode really want to run something like `python setup.py egg_info` to determine the library version, and unless you've built tvm, poetry will just crash trying to do anything. that's a bad developer experience.\r\n - Making `pyproject.toml` the authoritative source of dependencies (I.e. rewriting the docker/install scripts to install only using `poetry`) would be bad because non-users of poetry would have to transcribe the dependencies into e.g. `requirements.txt`. Yes, tools exist to do this; we should do it for them.\r\n\r\nHere are some future things I'd like to do to address these issues:\r\n- [ ] Write a script that uses e.g. dephell to auto-generate `python/requirements.txt` and `python/requirements-<extra>.txt` for each extra section included.\r\n- [ ] Write a unit test that asserts that `python/requirements*.txt` is in sync with `pyproject.toml`.\r\n- [ ] Make it easy to install all extras in one command (likely needs output from previous script)\r\n- [ ] Rewrite `docker/install/ubuntu_install_<extra>.sh` to just run `poetry install -E <extra>`.\r\n- [ ] Add `poetry lock` to the docker build process and export the generated lockfile somehow...\r\n- [ ] Decide what to do about `setup.py` library location hack.\r\n\r\nHere's why I think we should use something other than requirements.txt as the authoritative source of dependencies:\r\n - In order to ensure a smooth user experience, we do have to pin our dependencies to *some* degree. Here, I've pinned to the package minor or major version where that made sense.\r\n - However, of course pinning is bad unless you update your pinned deps. so some dependency management tool provides that capability. I'm not at all attached to poetry as the tool to use for that, but it can facilitate

found that requiring explicit broadcasting along the batch dimension for `batch_matmul` could cause serious memory issues during constant folding, since it would effectively multiply the size of weights by the input batch size. This PR allows implicit broadcasting along the batch dimension for batch_matmul without increasing compute or memory requirements. This should in fact give pretty significant speedups in cases where we previously applied explicit broadcasting. I also noticed that we had an unused C++ definition of `batch_matmul` and removed it to prevent confusion.","created_at":"2020-10-02T18:44:46Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T15:54:55Z","closed_at":"2020-10-06T21:07:27Z","merged_at":"2020-10-06T21:07:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"889fac157beb2a07830b32008980b902a7feee28","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858780915,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3ODA5MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20review","name":"status:

I'm trying to use Ansor to tune the operators generated from `te.gradient`, I fixed some issues in this PR so that now Ansor can tune the backward ops (regardless the performance). Detail change list:\r\n\r\n- [Multiple Output] Create a schedule with all outputs instead of the first output.\r\n- [Python API Printing] Change `tvm.thread_axis` to `te.thread_axis`.\r\n- [Python API Printing] Add prefix to all iterators to avoid name conflict; otherwise we may refer to the wrong iterator with the same name hint (e.g., `ax0`). For example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nax0, ... = tuple(pad_temp_data_grad.op.axis) + ...\r\n...\r\nax0, ... = tuple(pad_temp_shared.op.axis) + ...\r\ns[pad_temp_data_grad].split(ax0, factor=4)\r\n```\r\nwhere `ax0` in `split` should refer to the `ax0` from `pad_temp_data_grad`, but it has been overridden by `pad_temp_shared` after `cache_read`. This PR improves `CleanName` by providing an optional prefix so that we can differentiate those iterators by their stages.\r\n\r\ncc @merrymercy @jcf94

I'm not sure which part of this mutation rule gets a wrong result now.\r\nBut it's strange that this bug is not always reproduceable, it occurs with a very small possibility(Which may caused by the multithread?). There may still be some leak conditions in our random generator design.\r\n\r\ncc @tqchen @comaniac @FrozenGene

ConvertLayout encounters an operator which is supported by ConvertLayout but a desired_layout is not provided by the user, it will create a fatal error. With this PR, it will instead just give a warning and leave that operator how it was.\r\n\r\nCurrently, anytime a new operator is added to ConvertLayout, it will break ConvertLayout for anyone using it in their code. For example, a BYOC target may want all Conv2D ops to be converted to NCHW but doesn't care about the layout of other ops.
