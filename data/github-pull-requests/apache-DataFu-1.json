new method for when you want to de-duplicate records, but not lose any \"real\" data.\r\n\r\nFor example if a server creates events with an autogenerated event id, and sometimes\r\nevents are duplicated. You don't want double rows just for the event ids, but if any of the other fields are distinct you want to keep the rows (with their original event ids) - otherwise you'd just drop the event id column. In order to keep at least one value you need to tediously list all the other columns.\r\n\r\nJIRA:

a lot of our solutions, we select only a fixed number of rows, based on ordering by a column, usually a small amount. Datafu has dedupTopN, which uses a window function, and dedupWithCombiner, which is limited to only taking one record per grouping. dedupTopN is using a window function, which is inefficient because it orders all of the rows per group, and is very susceptible to skew. DedupWithCombiner won't let us take more than one row. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a solution - a class that implements DeclarativeAggregate, to avoid declaring the schemas explicitly and using the combiner to avoid skew and Codegen.","created_at":"2024-10-09T14:06:05Z","updated_at":"2025-01-23T08:59:36Z","closed_at":"2025-01-23T08:59:36Z","merged_at":"2025-01-23T08:59:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"a8264f77e333a9d6e38252c5ff3b5abdd25d9049","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/datafu/pulls/45/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/datafu/pulls/45/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/datafu/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/datafu/issues/45/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/datafu/statuses/a3bf2c4aadd08638c946d8417d95669182466c1e","head":{"label":"benraha:add_collectNumberOrderedElements","ref":"add_collectNumberOrderedElements","sha":"a3bf2c4aadd08638c946d8417d95669182466c1e","user":{"login":"benraha","id":8566351,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NjYzNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8566351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benraha","html_url":"https://github.com/benraha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benraha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benraha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benraha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benraha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benraha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benraha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benraha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benraha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benraha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":512388702,"node_id":"R_kgDOHopuXg","name":"datafu","full_name":"benraha/datafu","private":false,"owner":{"login":"benraha","id":8566351,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NjYzNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8566351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benraha","html_url":"https://github.com/benraha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benraha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benraha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benraha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benraha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benraha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benraha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benraha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benraha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benraha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/benraha/datafu","description":"Mirror

DataFu compile and test with Spark 3.2.4.\r\n\r\nMost things would have worked with the previous version, but this fixed the functionality in [SparkOverwriteUDAFs](https://github.com/eyala/datafu/blob/main/datafu-spark/src/main/scala/spark/utils/overwrites/SparkOverwriteUDAFs.scala) which breaks in Spark 3.2.0. As an additional note - most of the functionality in DataFu also works in Spark 3.3.x, but there are tests failing so this is an incremental improvement.\r\n\r\nAlso some fixes for ordering issues in

Summary\r\nAdding an option for broadcast join skew - currently, there is a parameter to take the top skewed keys.\r\nThis new option is for taking skewed keys more than a certain number.\r\n\r\n# Details\r\nWhen calculating the \"limit\", in cases there are many tasks, it could take a long time. \r\nFor example, \"limit 10000\" mean that each task will send its 10k rows to one reducer which will then need to run a local limit on #tasks*10k. If most of these keys are not really skewed that's a waste of a lot of time.\r\nso adding the above param to make sure only skewed keys are being

The bug causes libxml2's HTML4 parser to fail to recover when encountering a bare <code>&lt;</code> character in some contexts. This version of Nokogiri restores the earlier behavior, which is to recover from the parse error and treat the <code>&lt;</code> as normal character data (which will be serialized as <code>&amp;lt;</code> in a text node).

The bug causes libxml2's HTML4 parser to fail to recover when encountering a bare <code>&lt;</code> character in some contexts. This version of Nokogiri restores the earlier behavior, which is to recover from the parse error and treat the <code>&lt;</code> as normal character data (which will be serialized as <code>&amp;lt;</code> in a text node). The bug (and the fix) is only relevant when the <code>RECOVER</code> parse option is set, as it is by default.

Please note that Windows users should use the <code>x64-mingw-ucrt</code> platform gem for Ruby 3.1, and <code>x64-mingw32</code> for Ruby 2.6–3.0 (see <a href=\"https://rubyinstaller.org/2021/12/31/rubyinstaller-3.1.0-1-released.html\">RubyInstaller 3.1.0 release notes</a>).</p>\n<p>This release ends support for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ruby 2.5, for which <a href=\"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/\">official support ended 2021-03-31</a>.</li>\n<li>JRuby 9.2, which is a Ruby 2.5-compatible release.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Faster, more reliable installation: Native Gem for ARM64 Linux</h4>\n<p>This version of Nokogiri ships experimental native gem support for the <code>aarch64-linux</code> platform, which should support AWS Graviton and other ARM Linux platforms. We don't yet have CI running for this platform, and so we're interested in hearing back from y'all whether this is working, and what problems you're seeing. Please send us feedback here: <a href=\"https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/discussions/2359\">Feedback: Have you used the <code>aarch64-linux</code> native gem?</a></p>\n<h4>Publishing</h4>\n<p>This version of Nokogiri opts-in to the <a href=\"https://guides.rubygems.org/mfa-requirement-opt-in/\">&quot;MFA required to publish&quot; setting</a> on Rubygems.org. This and all future Nokogiri gem files must be published to Rubygems by an account with multi-factor authentication enabled. This should provide some additional protection against supply-chain attacks.</p>\n<p>A related discussion about Trust exists at <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2357\">#2357</a> in which I invite you to participate if you have feelings or opinions on this topic.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

the CodeGuru report:\r\n- Similar code fragments were detected in the same file at the following lines: 270:284, 295:309. I refactored the code to remove duplicates.\r\n- some lines of code lack validation when processing input data.\r\n- Iterating over map.keySet() and calling map.get(Key) to get the values within the loop is inefficient.  Iterate over map.entrySet() and access the values using entry.getValue() to avoid potential performance penalty due to lookup.\r\n- Some loops containing this operation may iterate indefinitely if the operation throws an exception on multiple instances of its evaluation. As the operation throws an exception, it bypasses exit points in the loop and continues to the next iteration through a catch clause.\r\n- use %d, not %s, for integers. This ensures locale-sensitive formatting.\r\n- An equality operator (== or !=) is used to compare strings, which matches strings based on address. Use equals(), not ==, when checking if two strings are equal\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-09T20:18:03Z","updated_at":"2022-05-05T06:40:09Z","closed_at":"2022-05-05T06:40:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bb38c4baac7dd3a811b95b599dac34990f9a1be4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/datafu/pulls/17/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/datafu/pulls/17/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/datafu/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/datafu/issues/17/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/datafu/statuses/412b519265e042657a20034b94acc66638f8d4fd","head":{"label":"XinyuLiu5566:master","ref":"master","sha":"412b519265e042657a20034b94acc66638f8d4fd","user":{"login":"XinyuLiu5566","id":59004176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDA0MTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59004176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinyuLiu5566","html_url":"https://github.com/XinyuLiu5566","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinyuLiu5566/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinyuLiu5566/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinyuLiu5566/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinyuLiu5566/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinyuLiu5566/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinyuLiu5566/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinyuLiu5566/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinyuLiu5566/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XinyuLiu5566/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"4a49fb59abae388e205fbf652ed39907f3c25e62","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":15895714,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTg5NTcxNA==","name":"datafu","full_name":"apache/datafu","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/datafu","description":"Mirror

In many of our application, we need the IN operator for FILTER to operation on a string representing multiple values e.g. 'AU,SG,HK' for a country list.
