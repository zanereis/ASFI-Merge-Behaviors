wildcard in the SQL to represent all the columns.\r\n\r\nthat means if we have \"id\", \"name\", \"age\", \"ts\" these four columns already and we want to add a new column driver from ts, we can use\r\n\r\n\"select *, FROM_UNIXTIME(ts / 1000, 'yyyyMMdd') as dt from table_name\"\r\n\r\nto represent\r\n\r\n\"select id, name, age, ts, FROM_UNIXTIME(ts / 1000, 'yyyyMMdd') as dt from

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nThis pull request supports ORC storage in hudi.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - Implemented HoodieOrcWriter\r\n    - Added HoodieOrcConfigs\r\n    - Added AvroOrcUtils that writes Avro record to VectorizedRowBatch\r\n    - Used orc-core:no-hive module (`no-hive` is needed because spark-sql uses no-hive version of orc and it would become easier for spark integration)\r\n  - Implemented HoodieOrcReader\r\n    - Read Avro records from VectorizedRowBatch\r\n    - Implemented OrcReaderIterator\r\n    - Implemented ORC utility functions\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n  - Added unit tests for\r\n    - reader/writer creation\r\n    - AvroOrcUtils\r\n  - (local) Wrote a small tool that reads from ORC/Parquet files and writes to ORC/Parquet files, verified that the records in the input/output files are identical using spark.read.orc/spark.read.parquet.\r\n  - (local) Changed the HoodieTableConfig.DEFAULT_BASE_FILE_FORMAT to force the tests to run with ORC as the base format. Some changes need to be made, but I'm leaving it out of this PR to get some initial feedback on the reader/writer implementation first.\r\nFor all tests to pass with ORC as the base file format:\r\n    - Understand schema evolution in ORC (ref TestUpdateSchemaEvolution)\r\n    - Add ORC support for places that have hardcoded ParquetReader or sqlContext.read().parquet()\r\n    - Add ORC support for bootstrap op\r\n    - Hive engine integration with ORC (implement HoodieOrcInputFormat, and more)\r\n    - Spark engine integration with ORC (implement HoodieInternalRowOrcWriter, and more)\r\n    - Add ORC support for HoodieSnapshotExporter\r\n    - Implement HDFSOrcImporter\r\n    - and possibly more.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [x] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [x] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [x] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.","created_at":"2021-05-27T04:47:12Z","updated_at":"2024-11-16T23:19:19Z","closed_at":"2021-06-15T22:21:43Z","merged_at":"2021-06-15T22:21:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"b8fe5b91d599418cd908d833fd63edc7f362c548","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/2999/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/2999/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2999/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/cc731794bc22494488d94eb4e951105125ab5b97","head":{"label":"jintaoguan:orc-reader-writer","ref":"orc-reader-writer","sha":"cc731794bc22494488d94eb4e951105125ab5b97","user":{"login":"jintaoguan","id":2390826,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTA4MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2390826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jintaoguan","html_url":"https://github.com/jintaoguan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jintaoguan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jintaoguan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jintaoguan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jintaoguan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jintaoguan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jintaoguan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jintaoguan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jintaoguan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jintaoguan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"4eb6ef8144861599f858b4119a3574e37dfbea58","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":76474200,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NjQ3NDIwMA==","name":"hudi","full_name":"apache/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi","description":"Upserts,

of https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2309\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIf schema contains nested records, then HoodieAvroUtils rewrite() function copies the record fields as-is, from the oldrecord to the newRecord.   If fields of the nested record have evolved, it would result in SchemaCompatibilityException or ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nModify HoodieAvroUtils rewrite() to rewrite the evolved fields, with new/evolved fields initialized to null.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as TestHoodieAvroUtils.\r\nAdded testRewriteToEvolvedNestedRecord() and testRewriteToShorterRecord()\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes the NullPointerException when trying to get the partition path from a record with null value in the  nested partition path field.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Changed the logic in `RowKeyGeneratorHelper. getNestedFieldVal()` to account for null values in the last level of the nested field.\r\n- Added unit tests of getting the partition path from a nested field, in `TestSimpleKeyGenerator`.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nNew unit tests are added in `TestSimpleKeyGenerator` to verify the behavior.  Also the bulk insert of records with null values in the nested partition path field can successfully run, which fails before this PR.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ]

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- Once table's schema got evolved, if a new batch of ingestion has old schema records, it will fail. This patch fixes this issue.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Fixed both DeltaSync and Spark writer flow where a new batch of records with old schema after table's schema got evolved should succeed. \r\n  - In delta sync, fix is put in only when no target schema is provided and hence we fall back to row based schema provider. Fix is to fetch latest table schema and use that to convert to avro. \r\n\r\n  There are different flows here, so detailing the fixes. \r\n  \r\n  High level use-case:\r\n  batch1: records inserted with schema1\r\n  batch2: records upserted with schema2 (evolved schema)\r\n  batch3: records upserted with schema1: Fix is for this batch of upserts. \r\n  \r\n  Delta streamer\r\n  this table is about batch3 upserts. \r\n  table type | cur table schema | transformer | record schema after transformer | is user provided schema | user provided schema | expected behavior |\r\n  --------|-----|------|------|------|-----|---|\r\n  COW| schema2| yes | schema1| true | schema2 | upsert succeed. new cols that were not part of incoming batch will be set to default val|\r\n  COW| schema2| yes | schema1| false | null | upsert succeed.  Schema will be fetched from table and used to convert to avro. new cols that were not part of incoming batch will be set to default val|\r\n  MOR| schema2| yes | schema1| true | schema2 | upsert succeed. new cols that were not part of incoming batch will be set to default val|\r\n  MOR| schema2| yes | schema1| false | null | upsert succeed.  Schema will be fetched from table and used to convert to avro. new cols that were not part of incoming batch will be set to default val|\r\n  \r\n  Spark writer\r\n  There is no transformer involved here. \r\n  So, both COW and MOR should work for batch3. schema is always inferred from df and so schema1 is what is inferred. But the fix will leverage table schema and convert. \r\nNote: There are chances that some user/flow tries to write to hudi w/ a partial fields by mistake and enabling the config for this new code path. we might automatically convert and ingest. Something to keep in mind. \r\n\r\n-  Guarded all of the above changes using a new config DataSourceWriteOptions.HANDLE_SCHEMA_MISMATCH_FOR_INPUT_BATCH_OPT_KEY (`hoodie.datasource.write.handle.schema.mismatch.for.input.batch`)\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Fixed tests in HoodieSparkSqlWriterSuite to verify the change. \r\n  - Added tests to TestHoodieDeltaStreamer.\r\n  - Added tests to TestHoodieSparkUtils to verify changes in AvroConversionHelper. \r\n\r\nTo be discussed: Essentially we have fixed two diff things in this patch even tough both are kind of related. supporting ingestion of old schema records and supporting evolving schema by adding new columns anywhere in existing schema. Not sure if we need two diff configs to guard both these or just one(as of now its all guarded by one flag). \r\n  \r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes,

PR adds the support for Date, Timestamp, LocalDate and LocalDateTime types in TimestampBasedAvroKeyGenerator. Hence, columns with these types can be used for partitioning. The support for Date and Timestamp types are added because those are used by Spark for DateType and TimestampType respectively. The support for LocalDate and LocalDateTime are added because that is how Avro date, `timestamp-micros` and `timestamp-millis` are represented in `HoodieAvroUtils`. \r\n\r\nIn addition to this, `HoodieAvroUtils` did not handle type conversions properly for `timestamp-micros` and `timestamp-millis` logical types and that has been fixed.\r\n\r\nTest cases are added to verify the functionality and manual jobs have been run to validate the changes as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAdd support for reusing fileId in clustering execution strategy. This is strategy specific. Default is still to create new files\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nSome datasets rely on external index. We cannot change record location for clustering (because external index doesn't support update). We can still take advantage of clustering by doing 'local' sorting within each file. Add support for such strategies.\r\n\r\nAlso, made small changes on how metadata is generated after clustering is complete. (metadata is getting generated redundantly twice before. Removed 1 to make it simple).\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\nThis change added tests \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ]

discussed in [RFC-14](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HUDI/RFC+-+14+%3A+JDBC+incremental+puller), this change implements the first phase of JDBC incremental puller.\r\nIt consists following changes:\r\n\r\n- JdbcSource: This class extends RowSource and implements\r\n  fetchNextBatch(Option<String> lastCkptStr, long sourceLimit)\r\n\r\n- SqlQueryBuilder: A simple utility class to build sql queries fluently.\r\n\r\n- Implements two modes of fetching: full and incremental.\r\n  Full is a complete scan of RDBMS table.\r\n  Incremental is delta since last checkpoint.\r\n  Incremental mode falls back to full fetch in case of any exception.\r\n\r\n- Caches the dataset after scan. Storage level is configurable.\r\n\r\n- Added unit tests to cover both incremental and full fetch.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [*] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n -

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1343 was added so that default and nulls are handled properly. This fix is applicable only to deltastreamer flow. But later, we had a [fix](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2765) in spark ds layer which fixed the defaults and null values. So, the schema post processor is not really required anymore.

I replaced it with a .isEmpty() call and amended the error message to direct the user to the task logs. I also added a log statement to clearly indicate that BULK_INSERT is being used.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis issue only occurs with very large upserts of thin rows (600 million changed rows with 12 fields) on a resource constrained cluster.

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis pr adds support for metadata based listing for Hudi Spark DataSource and Spark SQL based queries. The detailed design for Spark integration (V2 implementation specifically) can be found at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HUDI/RFC+-+15%3A+HUDI+File+Listing+Improvements#RFC15:HUDIFileListingImprovements-Spark. Two parts of the V2 design have already been implemented:\r\n- Custom FileIndex for Hudi: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2651\r\n- Registering Hudi tables as DataSource tables in Hive metastore so they are executed via Hudi DataSource instead of Hive InputFormat/Serde. In the process, it will also use the FileIndex implemented in Hudi DataSource: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2283\r\n\r\nIn this pr we build on top of the FileIndex implementation to get file listing using Hudi's metadata table if the feature is enabled, and otherwise fallback to distributed listing using Spark Context. The metadata table will be read just once and it will reduce O(N) list calls to O(1) get calls for N partitions. We also refactor the Hudi metadata table contract to add a new API which can fetch lists for multiple partitions (opens the reader just once). \r\n\r\nI have further re-factored HoodieFileIndex for more efficient integration in case of MOR real time queries. Earlier we were just listing base files using the file index and later it would again perform listing for log files in `MergeOnReadSnapshotRelation` using `groupLogsByBaseFile`. Now, I will be storing and fetching both base and log files in-case of real time queries. This ensures that filesystem is listed just once if filesystem listing is used. In case of metadata, it ensures the it will be read just once and no addition listing or reading is done to fetch log files.\r\n\r\nFixes #2935\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n- Existing unit tests updated\r\n- Internally on AWS EMR ran several performance tests via Spark DataSource and Spark SQL to observe improvements in query planning times\r\n\r\n##
