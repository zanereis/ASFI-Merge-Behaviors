In addition to repeating the test X number of times, this attribute ensures that each iteration resets the test seed on `RandomizedContext.RandomGenerator` so failed test conditions can be replicated without the need to apply the `RepeatAttribute`.\r\n\r\nThis sets a precedent for how to test other NUnit extensions (such as attributes) so we can also add tests to confirm they behave as expected. Some bits of the NUnit test approach were added so we can integration test the `RepeatAttribute` to confirm the correct behavior. The commit cdfd62bbc8e4f89382fd2624f6889d0750163357 includes additional asserts that verify:\r\n\r\n- The same random seed is used for the duration of the test\r\n- The same test seed is used for the duration of the test\r\n- The test seed changes from one iteration to the next\r\n\r\nNote that `RepeatAttribute` does not repeat the `OneTimeSetUp()` or `OneTimeTearDown()` during each iteration, so every repeated try will use the same culture, time zone, similarity, and codec. Perhaps we can do that at some future point, but it is more complicated to maintain the `TestExectutionContext`, `RandomizedContext` and seeds to make that happen.\r\n\r\nThe format of the random seed string has also changed to use 2 hexadecimal numbers separated by a `:`. However, existing seeds with one hexidecimal number can still be parsed to replicate test failures. This not only allows us to make features that update the seed, but also will make test replicability more stable across source code updates on tests.","created_at":"2025-01-27T08:20:00Z","updated_at":"2025-01-27T14:35:58Z","closed_at":"2025-01-27T14:35:58Z","merged_at":"2025-01-27T14:35:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"fa630dabaff833a5c4dddb72157ccddd32fcf08c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7725649993,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABzHwQSQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:improvement","name":"notes:improvement","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"An

Some of the tests are from Harmony where applicable, and others are lucenenet-specific. \r\n\r\nSimilar to the discussion at https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/1121#discussion_r1927206723, this fixes some culture/locale inconsistencies with Java. It also removes some ToString methods that were Culture-aware overloads, but these overloads were unused (and this is an internal class, so that's not a breaking change).\r\n\r\nAs noted in the methods, `Collections.ToString` is based on the `toString` method from Java's `AbstractCollection`/`AbstractMap`. In Java, this method is not Locale-aware, so that the output is consistent across locales. As such, it does not format numbers using i.e. a decimal comma, nor does it use a Locale-aware list separator. It is neither good for serialization/deserialization, nor for display in a UI. It is simply a string representation to be used for debugging and diagnostic purposes and is intended to be closer to a code representation than user-facing. (Even then it's arguably poor in some ways, as strings are not enclosed in double quotes, but it is what it is.)\r\n\r\nFor example, this Java code (can be run with JBang if you'd like) sets the current Locale to `fr-FR`, which has a decimal comma, but it does not use that in the output. (Java does not have a list separator concept in its Locales, as far as I know, but if it did, that should use a semicolon for `fr-FR` if it were Locale-aware.) \r\n\r\n```java\r\n///usr/bin/env jbang \"$0\" \"$@\" ; exit $?\r\n\r\nimport java.text.*;\r\nimport java.util.*;\r\nimport static java.lang.System.*;\r\n\r\npublic class hello {\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String... args) {\r\n        Locale.setDefault(new Locale(\"fr\", \"FR\"));\r\n        List<Object> list = new ArrayList<>();\r\n        list.add(list);\r\n        list.add(1);\r\n        list.add('a');\r\n        list.add(2.1);\r\n        list.add(\"xyz\");\r\n        list.add(new ArrayList<>() { { add(1); add(2); add(3); } });\r\n        list.add(null);\r\n        System.out.println(list); // prints: [(this Collection), 1, a, 2.1, xyz, [1, 2, 3], null]\r\n        // to demonstrate that the locale is applying when applicable...\r\n        NumberFormat nf = NumberFormat.getInstance();\r\n        System.out.println(nf.format(2.1)); // prints: 2,1\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the comma list separator and decimal point that indicates that the output is not Locale-aware. I set up the List-based test to exactly mimic this behavior, and assert the same output. This discovered that the test failed for cultures with a decimal comma, since it was just calling `.ToString()` on the value, which will use the current thread's culture. I changed this to use `Convert.ToString` with passing in the invariant culture to match Java's behavior. These ToString methods are only used in building exception messages or console app outputs so that fits the bill of diagnostic purposes that do not need to be locale-aware.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it was discovered that the Object-based ToString method could fail if the argument was null, so this has been fixed along with making the file enabled for nullable type checking. This caused some inconsistencies in warnings between .NET Framework, .NET Standard, and .NET 8, so if it seems like the annotations are a little too much, this was likely because of getting warnings in one of the other targets. In particular, the private IComparer implementations were made aggressively nullable.","created_at":"2025-01-27T02:50:53Z","updated_at":"2025-01-27T02:50:53Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"90e610c88a349746d8711a0f29816b670ef438a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7725649993,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABzHwQSQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:improvement","name":"notes:improvement","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"An

This is clearly invalid output, as you cannot tell the difference between the list delimiter and the decimal comma. I looked into what Java does, and it does not have such an overload. It always uses the invariant format with a decimal point, even if your current locale is set to one with a decimal comma. Given that this method was only used in one place, to build a debugging/diagnostic string in FacetResult, I figured that it would be better to match Java's behavior here and remove this overload, using the invariant culture instead. This way we don't have to create tests for what is certainly buggy behavior that is only used in one place in our codebase and only for diagnostic purposes. Additionally, this invariant output more closely matches what you would write in code as well, better catering the output for that purpose.","created_at":"2025-01-23T04:40:33Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T15:44:31Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c5635a147242c3657ac7e2c13622a1fa79878e56","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2110867322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTEwODY3MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/is:enhancement","name":"is:enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":false,"description":"New

So to exercise this class, some extension methods were added in the JSR166TestCase file to emulate a ThreadPoolExecutor's API surface. This keeps track of task state using a ConditionalWeakTable keyed on TaskScheduler, so that when the TaskScheduler is garbage collected, its state is cleaned up. The state is needed to track completed tasks, since LimitedConcurrencyLevelTaskScheduler removes/dequeues tasks when they are completed. This also implements the `joinPool` method in JSR166TestCase via waiting for all tracked tasks for the scheduler with a timeout.\r\n\r\nThis does not port all of the tests from Harmony, since most are irrelevant, but it ports enough to test executing tasks, concurrency level, the number of running/completed tasks, shutdown state, etc.\r\n\r\nAs noted in #1110, `FEATURE_THREADPOOL_UNSAFEQUEUEWORKITEM` was removed as all targets support this feature.","created_at":"2025-01-22T05:00:24Z","updated_at":"2025-01-23T18:30:35Z","closed_at":"2025-01-22T20:27:04Z","merged_at":"2025-01-22T20:27:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"b1d309fc657b2ae7bb20fa3e0ab5300351b52f17","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7725649993,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABzHwQSQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:improvement","name":"notes:improvement","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"An

Users that wish to override the Console.Out/Error behavior can use Console.SetOut or Console.SetError to replace them with a different TextWriter. Most of the usage is in tests anyways, and the usage in non-test code is behind VERBOSE flags. \r\n\r\n#936 raised an issue with MAUI support, but this was only a problem with Console.In. Console.Out and Console.Error work fine in MAUI.\r\n\r\nThis is a breaking change because SystemConsole was previously public.","created_at":"2025-01-21T04:39:25Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T16:01:23Z","closed_at":"2025-01-21T16:01:20Z","merged_at":"2025-01-21T16:01:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"ab73b083a064469e93408d9544bfb7576c512bd2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7707338076,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABy2SlXA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:breaking-change","name":"notes:breaking-change","color":"E5205C","default":false,"description":"Has

Otherwise, it means that a call may or may not block.\r\n\r\nThis test was failing because StringReader is not a CharFilter and thus it did not have an IsReady property. BufferedCharFilter only is ready if the underlying TextReader is a CharFilter and it returns true for IsReady. So given that BufferedCharFilter already properly cascaded the property, this fixes the failing test by adding a new adapter class to adapt the StringReader to a CharFilter so that it is IsReady-aware. Since StringReaders do not block on calls to Read, this always returns true.\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps a little bit of a leaky abstraction by having to know these details, but I don't think it really harms much in the design. This property only signals whether Read will block or not, and that's not something .NET TextReader implementations care to surface, nor is it used in Lucene. The only other alternatives here would be to have BufferedCharFilter take a CharFilter instead of a TextReader in its constructor, and that would cascade a bunch of mess to callers further up (if it's even possible to do so) and deviate from upstream, or to implement a Reader abstraction to better match Java and have to adapt all TextReaders to that (and all the extra allocations that would go along with that). I don't think either of those alternatives are worth it just for this property. Also, out of all 8 non-test implementations of CharFilter, only BufferedCharFilter overrides IsReady, and it just delegates it to the inner CharFilter (if it is one) anyways. So while this test ensures that it works correctly for BufferedCharFilter for end user code, it doesn't seem to have much utility in Lucene/Lucene.NET, most likely because these calls would usually block (or at least not be guaranteed to block).","created_at":"2025-01-19T22:58:34Z","updated_at":"2025-01-20T15:17:37Z","closed_at":"2025-01-20T15:17:34Z","merged_at":"2025-01-20T15:17:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"013f962c247a8d296bedb781889693034527a9e4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7707348286,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABy2TNPg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:bug-fix","name":"notes:bug-fix","color":"15D3BE","default":false,"description":"Contains

This moves the PrintStackTrace extension method into Support, makes it print any Suppressed exceptions, and updates all usages where Lucene uses `printStackTrace` on a caught exception to use this new extension method. \r\n\r\nIn the case where the Lucene code was doing `new Throwable().printStackTrace(...)` to print the stack trace at the call site, this has been replaced with the new `StackTraceHelper.PrintCurrentStackTrace(TextWriter)` method. This method skips the frame of itself in the stack trace, and has `NoInlining` set to prevent inlining which could cause the top stack frame to be missed.\r\n\r\nFor suppressed exceptions, it will print them below the string output of the exception if there are any. This PR does not change the structure of suppressed exceptions, i.e. to use AggregateException as discussed in #932, as there didn't seem to be a good seam for doing that at this time.","created_at":"2025-01-14T05:18:57Z","updated_at":"2025-01-18T20:07:17Z","closed_at":"2025-01-18T20:07:14Z","merged_at":"2025-01-18T20:07:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"5374caacd50ab96d3c1ab97fe3418adc888888a8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7707348286,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABy2TNPg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:bug-fix","name":"notes:bug-fix","color":"15D3BE","default":false,"description":"Contains

It also removes it from methods with empty bodies, because an empty body doesn't call anything, and thus those checks in the tests would never be true anyways. Finally, it removes it in a few other places that were not asserted in tests.\r\n\r\nAs a TODO, I left the SystemConsole attributes there, even though those are suspect. We had discussed possibly being able to remove that class anyways, but I'll defer that for now.","created_at":"2025-01-12T05:34:28Z","updated_at":"2025-01-12T16:36:41Z","closed_at":"2025-01-12T16:36:38Z","merged_at":"2025-01-12T16:36:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"84b7c603875e3f488040534cd992414c648867d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7707921550,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABy22Mjg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:performance-improvement","name":"notes:performance-improvement","color":"D24381","default":false,"description":"Contains

NUnit already tracks the result state of the tests in `NUnit.Framework.Internal.TestExectionContext.CurrentContext.TestResult.ResultState` and `NUnit.Framework.TestContext.CurrentContext.Result.Outcome` in a context-sensitive and thread safe manner, so there is no need to reinvent the wheel with this. For the same reason, we don't need the `TestFailureMarker` property or `TestRuleMarkFailure` class, which are all part of this feature.\r\n\r\nThe new feature also revealed that there were some directories that were not being disposed in `Lucene.Net.Tests.Grouping` which were also addressed.\r\n\r\nFor some reason `TestFsts.TestRealTerms()` does not reliably cleanup its line file docs temp file on Windows, so this adds the `[SuppressTempFileChecks]` attribute to suppress the issue when it happens (for now). At some point we should have a look at this, but it is not a blocker for the release.\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-12T05:04:30Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T15:27:55Z","closed_at":"2025-01-17T15:27:54Z","merged_at":"2025-01-17T15:27:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"dcfa0e2f173eb1f4f41b9ae1dd4f27991e6e04e4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7707924543,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABy22YPw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:new-feature","name":"notes:new-feature","color":"47CF40","default":false,"description":"A

There were a couple cases that I fixed in this PR:\r\n\r\n- Lucene42DocValuesConsumer.SortedSetEnumerator did not implement the pattern correctly, but it also is an internal type with no subclasses, so this was made `sealed`.\r\n- Hunspell's TestDictionary.CloseCheckInputStream had a curious shadowing of Dispose that was causing it to not work correctly, and this exposed a bug: the stream wrapper was getting disposed of in Hunspell.Dictionary, when it is expected to not be disposed of. The shadowed Dispose method was never called, even if the Dictionary code actually did dispose of the wrapper. This created a false negative, where the test thought it wasn't disposed of when it actually was. This PR fixes that by removing the shadowing Dispose method, marking `this.disposed` in the actual Dispose pattern override method so that it's properly marked when called virtually, and leaving the stream open in the Dictionary.ReadDictionaryFiles method to match Java's behavior (and the expected behavior per the unit test).

The details of the random test configuration are now output only if the test fails and will appear in the test message directly. This used to be where they appeared in older versions of NUnit and this restores that functionality.\r\n2. Exceptions that were being called in `LuceneTestCase.OneTimeStartUp()` and `LuceneTestCase.OneTimeTearDown()` were not very visible because NUnit doesn't fail the test when they occur there. This changes it from re-throwing exceptions with an additional message to logging to the output. It goes to stderr in all cases except in `OneTimeTearDown()` where something is redirecting it to stdout. Either way, this changes the ADO pipeline to fail the build so we can avoid shipping the test framework with bugs in these methods.\r\n3. Adds a system property named `tests:failontestfixtureonetimesetuperror` that can be used to cause the test framework to fail all of the tests when there is an error in `OneTimeSetUp()`. We may need to revisit this because there are asserts thrown here that users are supposed to see when dependency injection for codecs is not setup correctly.\r\n4. Removes all messages from the `Assert.Pass()` method because this bloats the size of the test logs with no

All places where this is used in Lucene have been updated to use this extension method.\r\n\r\nThis should improve reliability of ensuring valid input in cases where Lucene would throw on invalid input, particularly with `IOUtils.GetDecodingReader` which, per its docs, was intended to throw on invalid input, but was doing a character replacement in Lucene.NET previously.","created_at":"2025-01-06T19:36:11Z","updated_at":"2025-01-12T04:16:31Z","closed_at":"2025-01-12T04:16:27Z","merged_at":"2025-01-12T04:16:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"4bf492c3b55fd94e9bd00822f6980c34b8c794b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7725649993,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABzHwQSQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:improvement","name":"notes:improvement","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"An

No tests actually need this attribute, but theoretically it is possible that a TestFramework user might want this. \r\n\r\nThis also fixes an issue where the previous code was treating _all_ tests as if it had this attribute, and was not throwing if removing the temporary files failed. This change will make our tests more reliable by ensuring they fail if temp file handles are held during cleanup.\r\n\r\nI'm also open to removing this attribute, since none of our tests need it and latest Lucene doesn't use it internally either. It could be viewed as a bad practice to just ignore these files being held too long.","created_at":"2025-01-02T04:40:55Z","updated_at":"2025-01-08T20:59:29Z","closed_at":"2025-01-08T20:56:50Z","merged_at":"2025-01-08T20:56:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"c3b689680b58f5c29b79143061d2d043a593ecb0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7707348286,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABy2TNPg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:bug-fix","name":"notes:bug-fix","color":"15D3BE","default":false,"description":"Contains

Additionally, this has the added benefit of having the `paramName` set to know which argument is out of range.","created_at":"2025-01-02T02:59:05Z","updated_at":"2025-01-02T03:04:54Z","closed_at":"2025-01-02T03:04:44Z","merged_at":"2025-01-02T03:04:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"dbc602c7f872189516dc132045f1cc2b69d5ca7e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7725649993,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABzHwQSQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:improvement","name":"notes:improvement","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"An

This is not needed since in C# we can use the `private protected` modifier to ensure that no outside classes can subtype this. This removes the need for the runtime check in the constructor, which will mildly improve performance. A comment was left explaining the divergence with the original commented-out code.","created_at":"2025-01-01T00:20:42Z","updated_at":"2025-01-01T00:28:26Z","closed_at":"2025-01-01T00:28:23Z","merged_at":"2025-01-01T00:28:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"47adc07d0e21cdc8f7548c9517b12d69e5521054","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7707921550,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABy22Mjg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:performance-improvement","name":"notes:performance-improvement","color":"D24381","default":false,"description":"Contains

i.e. single-leaf reader contexts that might take a while to complete (that would require a much larger and messier change to add CancellationToken support to Scorer and ICollector, and benchmarking to ensure we don't hurt performance by doing so), but should at least help with many scenarios that require cancellation.\r\n\r\nI wanted to publish this draft PR for feedback; please let me know if you

Some notable exceptions:\r\n\r\n1. The analysis was not focused on any fields in unit test projects.\r\n2. Any fields whose values changed in the latest Lucene were kept as static readonly, to be on the safe side.\r\n3. If there were other, similar fields that needed to be static readonly, the ones that were const-able were left as-is for consistency.\r\n4. Fields like VERSION_CURRENT were left as-is, since it might be expected to evaluate those.\r\n\r\nThis also addresses #679 with non-readonly static fields, where one of three things happened:\r\n\r\n1. If the visibility should be private, this visibility was changed to private.\r\n2. If the field really should have been readonly or const, this was changed appropriately.\r\n3. If the field really should be mutable, it was changed into a static property.","created_at":"2024-12-31T19:24:21Z","updated_at":"2025-01-19T15:56:32Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2e15c97b6cd6de62759a2d9f2c61e09f1739640f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7707338076,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABy2SlXA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:breaking-change","name":"notes:breaking-change","color":"E5205C","default":false,"description":"Has

There already was a sanity check for the unix epoch (long value 0) which ensured the round-trip to/from string was parsed _successfully_, but it was not checking that it was parsed _correctly_. This code had been modified heavily from the original Lucene and was missing this equality check.\r\n\r\nWhile investigating this, there were opportunities to clean up the code in this class, as well as to make it support using the `[Repeat]` attribute to help in diagnosing issues. The use of `String` was normalized to the `string` keyword, some redundant parentheses were removed, and the method capitalization was fixed. To enable `[Repeat]` support, several fields were moved from static to instance fields, and `OneTimeSetUp`/`OneTimeTearDown` was replaced with `SetUp`/`TearDown`. This allows for generating new random values when you repeat the test. Additionally, some extra info was added to the test assertion message to aid diagnosing issues if it fails.","created_at":"2024-12-31T04:19:13Z","updated_at":"2025-01-06T03:38:42Z","closed_at":"2025-01-06T03:38:38Z","merged_at":"2025-01-06T03:38:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"705a288862a3fb79f2032cdbaafed693932adcd0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7707348286,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABy2TNPg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:bug-fix","name":"notes:bug-fix","color":"15D3BE","default":false,"description":"Contains

This also fixes two FileStream leaks in demo code, #615.\r\n\r\nNote that CA2000 is _way_ too noisy to leave on, as there are literally hundreds of \"violations\" that would make our code a mess with `#pragma` suppressions. The Java upstream code is perhaps a little loose with keeping track of ICloseable lifetimes, but we have to match that in most cases. The cases fixed here were just ones where the object lifetime did not escape the method and it was safe to do so.

This results in some minor syntax differences in the generated code. The README.md file in this folder explains how to run the scripts (which is simply to run them with Python 3, no virtual environment or dependencies needed).\r\n\r\nHaving these scripts ported will help us ensure that the code is being generated the same way as in Java, as well as to assist any necessary future changes to how the files are generated. It also just helps complete our 1:1 port of the Lucene code, be it Java or Python. \r\n\r\nThis also corrects an out-of-date type name in the package.md documentation for this namespace.","created_at":"2024-12-17T16:45:23Z","updated_at":"2024-12-22T17:05:53Z","closed_at":"2024-12-22T17:05:53Z","merged_at":"2024-12-22T17:05:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"85c01412946ed1e2632cd2dfae4c672efd38caba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7725649993,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABzHwQSQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:improvement","name":"notes:improvement","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"An

This PR breaks GroupingSearch into three child classes (with some abstract base classes for common configuration properties) so that we can remove the covariance in the interfaces that were added to get this working in the original port. This keeps most of the interfaces but makes them non-generic (and thus, not covariant) for cases where you might need to have them in a common variable or collection. These were also needed for usage in the tests, where the test code randomly switches implementations that otherwise would not have common generic type parameters.\r\n\r\nLINQ was removed, and `IEnumerable<T>` was changed to `ICollection<T>`/`IList<T>` to match the original Java code. This should improve performance a little bit by being able to reference Count etc. directly.

This PR changes `volatile long` fields to be `AtomicInt64` from J2N, as well as introduces a new internal `AtomicDouble` type in Support for those values, using bit conversion to/from long internally so that we can use Interlocked on it.\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-12T19:04:44Z","updated_at":"2024-12-15T16:00:14Z","closed_at":"2024-12-15T16:00:10Z","merged_at":"2024-12-15T16:00:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"7cfc4c340c384bd5af39f42d7591dbe45344fd24","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/1064/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/1064/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/1064/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/59b474f2776af6a040ea375d80b36fc74ef9ae63","head":{"label":"paulirwin:issue/1063-1","ref":"issue/1063-1","sha":"59b474f2776af6a040ea375d80b36fc74ef9ae63","user":{"login":"paulirwin","id":1874103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzQxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1874103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin","html_url":"https://github.com/paulirwin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":8341602,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQxNjAy","name":"lucene.net","full_name":"paulirwin/lucene.net","private":false,"owner":{"login":"paulirwin","id":1874103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzQxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1874103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin","html_url":"https://github.com/paulirwin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/paulirwin/lucene.net","description":"Mirror

None of the implementations in our codebase need a non-reusable cleanup method, however, in discussion in #271, it was determined that there are possible use cases in which a custom TokenStream implementation might need to have their instance Disposed when the owning Analyzer (with stored values set by a ReuseStrategy) is disposed, so we have retained the IDisposable pattern as well. This PR also ensures that those values are disposed by way of DisposableThreadLocal and TokenStreamComponents disposing of their values.","created_at":"2024-12-05T04:55:21Z","updated_at":"2024-12-25T23:48:26Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5b23a05775b2321bba5b103d86b95ccc65d117da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7707338076,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABy2SlXA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:breaking-change","name":"notes:breaking-change","color":"E5205C","default":false,"description":"Has

UnicodeUtil APIs\r\n\r\nFixes #1024\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR includes several changes to the UnicodeUtil APIs:\r\n\r\n- New TryUTF8toUTF16 method added that uses the Try-method pattern common in .NET, so that it will return false if there is an incomplete UTF-8 byte sequence at the end\r\n- UTF8toUTF16 has been updated to throw a ParseException instead of IndexOutOfRangeException if there is an incomplete UTF-8 byte sequence at the end\r\n- New UTF8toUTF16WithFallback method that is like UTF8toUTF16 but adds the U+FFFD character to the output if there is an incomplete UTF-8 byte sequence at the end, instead of throwing\r\n- Moved ToCharArray to the ObsoleteAPI folder as a partial class, and marked for removal in the 4.8.0 RC\r\n- Add ReadOnlySpan overloads where applicable\r\n- Add TryUtf8ToString and Utf8ToStringWithFallback methods on BytesRef that call the respective methods in UnicodeUtil\r\n- Update callers where it makes sense to use these methods, such as ToString and logging/exception formatting where it doesn't make sense to throw an exception on invalid UTF-8","created_at":"2024-12-04T23:55:02Z","updated_at":"2025-01-12T03:36:47Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f79852c3005cfec766dc2d15436027610ca6fdc5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7725649993,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABzHwQSQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:improvement","name":"notes:improvement","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"An

This fixes an arithmetic overflow that results in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in ByteBlockPool for fields with a large number of small tokens. In .NET, the `checked` block causes the overflow to throw an OverflowException, just like how the upstream Java change to use `Math.addExact(x, y)` throws an ArithmeticException in that case.","created_at":"2024-12-03T03:36:25Z","updated_at":"2024-12-04T00:57:11Z","closed_at":"2024-12-04T00:57:07Z","merged_at":"2024-12-04T00:57:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"d597a5f38a6a2d78e075545190368735596ddcab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7707348286,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABy2TNPg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:bug-fix","name":"notes:bug-fix","color":"15D3BE","default":false,"description":"Contains

Instead of harming performance by forcing NoInlining, since this case inspecting the stack trace was only for an assertion rather than changing behavior (as other cases of inspecting the stack trace for specific methods do), this assertion was removed. It should only matter here if the exception is thrown; not which specific method throws it. The `Assert.Fail` above this `catch` explains exactly that, and the original comment was even questioning whether it should be removed.","created_at":"2024-12-02T23:48:35Z","updated_at":"2024-12-03T15:12:01Z","closed_at":"2024-12-03T15:11:58Z","merged_at":"2024-12-03T15:11:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"d1386d58836030aa8e7bb206df5bf8623cfdd8c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7707348286,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABy2TNPg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:bug-fix","name":"notes:bug-fix","color":"15D3BE","default":false,"description":"Contains

As part of this, added assertions around Stream.Read calls where the result was not checked.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of the IL `conv.i8` opcode (used in Expressions.JS) has changed in .NET 9 (at least for x64). It now behaves like Arm64. Instead of having to keep up with which matrix of frameworks and architectures produces what is effectively a meaningless value (division by zero then converting to long is undefined behavior in the CLR), this changes the assertion to allow for either value, regardless of framework/architecture.\r\n\r\nDue to the netstandard1.x warning, this PR also fixes #1037 and suppresses the warning for the code analysis projects on netstandard1.3 that must support Visual Studio 2017.","created_at":"2024-11-28T01:05:33Z","updated_at":"2024-12-12T15:21:15Z","closed_at":"2024-12-12T15:21:10Z","merged_at":"2024-12-12T15:21:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"9c88340caaf2a9fda404aba4958b51b8c3e7e8a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7707924543,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABy22YPw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:new-feature","name":"notes:new-feature","color":"47CF40","default":false,"description":"A

This seems to be due to x86 .NET Framework not masking off the operand correctly. Other platforms mask this off by 0x3f (63) since shifting by 64 or more would overflow, so this basically wraps the shift instead of overflowing. x86 netfx for some reason does not do this correctly. This adds a mask that does no harm on other platforms, but ensures that all are operating the same way.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to fix an issue on .NET 5/6 (still usable with our netstandard2.1 target), the right operand must be an Int32 in case it overflows. If the operand is an Int64 and it is out of range, it can crash the process as an invalid program.\r\n\r\nNote that this inlines the CompileBinary logic and no longer uses that method because we want to only mask off the second operand, not the first.","created_at":"2024-11-26T00:28:31Z","updated_at":"2024-11-26T16:56:08Z","closed_at":"2024-11-26T16:56:05Z","merged_at":"2024-11-26T16:56:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"e9c865cae246aae38827493ebd32af8409597853","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7707348286,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABy2TNPg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:bug-fix","name":"notes:bug-fix","color":"15D3BE","default":false,"description":"Contains

This removes the `[AwaitsFix]` from this test to see if it passes in GitHub Actions on Ubuntu today, and if so, we can merge this to re-enable the

In the case of methods that replace static constructor initialization, this was named `result` instead of the field name. In other cases where there was no Lucene equivalent, the variable was renamed.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes a bug in FieldInfos where there was the possibility of a KeyNotFoundException due to a coding oversight.\r\n\r\nThis investigation discovered a potential maintainability bug in `SortedSetDocValuesWriter.Flush`. Due to GetOrdCountEnumerable and GetOrdsEnumerable (previously named with a typo) having the same return type, their names were accidentally swapped. I fixed the typo in the names and fixed the names to match upstream. I also confirmed that the signature of AddSortedSetField expected them in this order.

With the net6.0 target dropped, we now use net6.0 to test netstandard2.1. This will help alleviate issues running .NET 5 tests on macOS Arm64 as well.\r\n\r\nThe github workflows were generated using the PowerShell

using ArgumentOutOfRangeException with a parameter name that doesn't exist, missing messages for ArgumentException, and so on.\r\n\r\nFor the analysis factories, these were reverted to be ArgumentException because various analysis tools (including Sonar and ReSharper/Rider) complain about using a key name for the dictionary when it doesn't exist as a parameter.\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-19T05:38:36Z","updated_at":"2024-11-19T16:11:57Z","closed_at":"2024-11-19T16:04:59Z","merged_at":"2024-11-19T16:04:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"b88e53ef0be0d92bf19b27e7b514401433577697","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7725649993,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABzHwQSQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:improvement","name":"notes:improvement","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"An

The classes implement the interface explicitly so that we can provide a default implementation that returns itself rather than `ISpanAppendable`, to match the existing Append overloads.\r\n\r\nNote that while `IAppendable` is now redundant in the interface list for these types, I left it there for Lucene source compatibility and reference, since `ISpanAppendable` does not exist in Lucene.\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-17T00:44:55Z","updated_at":"2024-11-19T20:49:17Z","closed_at":"2024-11-19T20:49:14Z","merged_at":"2024-11-19T20:49:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"0e54d6617c281491077df401a3d3f65134e05dd4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7725649993,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABzHwQSQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:improvement","name":"notes:improvement","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"An

The release excludes the `websites/` and `.github/` folders, since they are not required to build from source. However, if the `.msbuildproj` files are in these folders, they were causing the `Lucene.Net.sln` file to fail to load because it was missing dependencies. This change fixes that so the release will build without having to manually fixup the `Lucene.Net.sln` file as was the case in 4.8.0-beta00017.\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-06T14:31:19Z","updated_at":"2024-11-06T14:47:30Z","closed_at":"2024-11-06T14:47:30Z","merged_at":"2024-11-06T14:47:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"974db69cd5b07c2a19fcfa224c5102d4fb0c5a4b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7707331986,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAJ06c8AAAABy2SNkg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/labels/notes:ignore","name":"notes:ignore","color":"DA9476","default":false,"description":"Don't

The latter is the convention that NuGet uses.\r\n- So the procedure to update the `.htaccess` file is in the `make-release.md`

Additionally, our current codebase has what appears to be hand-ported lexer and parser code from the original Java, which in some cases has been updated manually as well. The original ANTLRv3 grammar is not in our repo. Ideally, we would generate the lexer and parser using ANTLR from the grammar. On top of this, we've had to change some assertions from the original Java due to discrepancies in the implementation.\r\n\r\nThis adds the 4.8 grammar to the repo, but updates its syntax to use the v4 format. Notably, ANTLRv4 removes the old v3 AST generation and instead lets you walk the parse tree however you see fit. This means that things like \"root nodes\" (indicated by `!`) in the old grammar are no longer necessary or supported, and thus require a different approach to walking the syntax tree. Additionally, empty lexer tokens like `AT_CALL` are no longer supported, so that use was changed into a new `call` rule instead, with corresponding `LUCENENET-specific` callout. Error handling is done another way now, resulting in not needing to add inline C# to the grammar. Other than these changes, the grammar is highly similar to the upstream 4.8 v3 grammar. I decided to stick with the 4.8 grammar instead of updating to the most recent grammar which is already in v4 format to keep it as close as possible to the 4.8 code.\r\n\r\nThe added Antlr4BuildTasks NuGet package (MIT-licensed) generates the lexer and parser code at compile time now, which reduces manual error and shrinks the size of the code we have to maintain. By removing the lexer and parser from the codebase, this PR results in a net reduction of about 3k lines of code. This also is configured to generate a Listener base class, which is the v4 approach that is closest to the existing 4.8 code (as opposed to a Visitor that returns nodes, as the latest Lucene code uses).\r\n\r\nThe JavascriptCompiler C# code now looks a bit different as a result of implementing the visitor, but this seemed like a cleaner and more maintainable approach than recursively walking every parse tree child. The `Context` classes that are generated for each rule are now strongly-typed, so you get the benefit of not having to compare rule/token indices. Another goal of this PR is to upgrade this dependency and change the approach in code without changing any existing tests or public API surface. As a result, the listener implementation is a private nested class instead of public, and this also helps keep the logic mostly in line with where it was before (just a little out of order). Note that we are not using the ParseTreeWalker because we want to control the order of entering nodes, so this might look a little different than other implementations of the Listener in ANTLR.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes some assertions that were changed from the original Java code, because this implementation produces the same results as the Java Lucene 4.8 code. Notably this is due to casting operands to longs before performing shift and bitwise operations, whereas the previous code was erroneously converting all numbers to int/long if there were any shifts or bitwise operations in the source text. This worked fine for some unit test examples, but could quickly break down for anything more complex than that. All numbers are treated as System.Double except for when shifts or bitwise operations are involved, in which case they are casted to Int64/I8 which truncates any decimal place

Due to a conflict between extension methods in .NET 8 and J2N, we added new methods to Collections to create J2N read-only collections instead of using the extension method. The unit tests will use the net8.0 targets when run under .NET 8 now, instead of net6.0.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this resolves a warning when running the .NET 5 tests, and ensures the `_artifacts/NuGetPackages` folder is created in the build script before restore, which is helpful when you add that folder as a local path in your NuGet sources for testing purposes.\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-21T23:15:20Z","updated_at":"2024-10-22T14:56:59Z","closed_at":"2024-10-22T14:56:56Z","merged_at":"2024-10-22T14:56:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"4a190ffff3031da0d3aeda7facf6ec574110d131","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/982/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/982/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/982/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/231084d39ddc20dc942754e60efa51a17775438b","head":{"label":"paulirwin:issue/928","ref":"issue/928","sha":"231084d39ddc20dc942754e60efa51a17775438b","user":{"login":"paulirwin","id":1874103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzQxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1874103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin","html_url":"https://github.com/paulirwin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":8341602,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQxNjAy","name":"lucene.net","full_name":"paulirwin/lucene.net","private":false,"owner":{"login":"paulirwin","id":1874103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzQxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1874103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin","html_url":"https://github.com/paulirwin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulirwin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/paulirwin/lucene.net","description":"Mirror

into a different folder, which addresses the issue with .NET 7+: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/sdk/7.0/solution-level-output-no-longer-valid.\r\n\r\nWhile this has been confirmed to work, it bloats the size of the test artifacts so much that we use 93% of the 10GB allotted on Microsoft hosted build agents: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#my-pipeline-fails-with-the-error-no-space-left-on-device\r\n\r\nThis also removes the GitHub workflow that warns when a possible dependency change has been done, which is no longer

It sets up two redirects into the API documentation using .htaccess rewrite rules. The implementation adds two useful URL paths:\r\n•\t/doc/latest/: Redirects users to the API documentation for the most recent officially released version of Lucene.NET.\r\n•\t/doc/absolute-latest/: Directs users to the absolute latest version of the API documentation, which may include pre-release versions.\r\nThese redirects allow the main website to link to the API documentation dynamically, without hardcoding the version number in the URLs, ensuring that users are always directed to the correct version of the documentation even as we provide new version of Lucene.NET and its accompanying API documentation.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-27T20:10:49Z","updated_at":"2024-09-27T20:12:21Z","closed_at":"2024-09-27T20:12:21Z","merged_at":"2024-09-27T20:12:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"c0537195aaee87b0d75e69da02e80fb7c32f9b42","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/965/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/965/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/965/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/4a20060b30eb3eb6847f4fc05b60dd3492cf186a","head":{"label":"rclabo:feature/website_redirect_latest","ref":"feature/website_redirect_latest","sha":"4a20060b30eb3eb6847f4fc05b60dd3492cf186a","user":{"login":"rclabo","id":6945499,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDU0OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6945499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo","html_url":"https://github.com/rclabo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":339189428,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzkxODk0Mjg=","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"rclabo/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rclabo","id":6945499,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDU0OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6945499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo","html_url":"https://github.com/rclabo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rclabo/lucenenet","description":"Apache

If the Main method is in a static class that looks to be designed solely for use from the command line then similar comments are added to the class.\r\n3) In the process of doing the code sweep to add comments, I discovered one cli command Lucene,Net.Cli.BenchmarkFindQualityQueriesCommand that was wired up to the wrong command class.  So I fixed this bug as well by wiring it up the right one which is QualityQueriesFinder.Main(args).\r\n4) the 4th commit was due to realizing that I had one failing test due to me making TermStats.TermText a public field rather than a public property.  So this commit fixes that and the failing unit test.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-25T22:17:35Z","updated_at":"2024-10-22T20:51:43Z","closed_at":"2024-10-22T20:51:43Z","merged_at":"2024-10-22T20:51:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"19396658661fa122ef02393a770f598dbf920abb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/963/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/963/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/963/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/1899e51cdcb4a74b4ea2608a6bfcf2253e874823","head":{"label":"rclabo:bugfix/959-TermStats_and_CLIRelatedComments","ref":"bugfix/959-TermStats_and_CLIRelatedComments","sha":"1899e51cdcb4a74b4ea2608a6bfcf2253e874823","user":{"login":"rclabo","id":6945499,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDU0OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6945499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo","html_url":"https://github.com/rclabo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":339189428,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzkxODk0Mjg=","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"rclabo/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rclabo","id":6945499,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDU0OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6945499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo","html_url":"https://github.com/rclabo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rclabo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rclabo/lucenenet","description":"Apache

is a leg more on the fix @paulirwin have been trying out for solving #911 \r\n\r\nThis is based on the commits @paulirwin made here: https://github.com/paulirwin/lucene.net/tree/issue/911\r\n\r\nUse this to finish off the what is left to have docfx fully working.\r\n\r\n## What did I add?\r\n\r\n1. Replaced `toc.yml`\r\nAs mentioned [here](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/793#issuecomment-2349070692) there was a problem with the `toc.yml` being locked this was fixed by changing the path to `\"./toc.yml\"` instead of `toc.yml\"`.\r\n\r\n![luc-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3019453e-bdab-48e9-a546-1064fa347e83)\r\n\r\n2. Added small delay when building site output.\r\n\r\nWhile the first fix solved the problem I noticed in one case when running locally that the file got locked anyway therefore I added a 1 second delay between starting new site out builds and haven't seen the error since.\r\n\r\n3. Fixed the links to the assets (`js` and `css`)\r\n\r\nWhen starting the docs site locally the pages weren't showing the CSS or using the js files because the route was wrong due to the missing `_rel` variable, therefore, I've added a slash `/` before all uses of these files so it works locally and removed the ending slash from the `docfx.global.subsite.json`.\r\n\r\n`docfx.vendor.css` was also changed to `docfx.vendor`.min.css`.\r\n`docfx.vendor.js` was also changed to `docfx.vendor.min.js`\r\n\r\n4. Added an environment variable replacement postprocessor\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it works in all cases that it should but I've created a `EnvironmentVariableProcessor` that makes sure to replace `EnvVar:ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE` to the actual value of the environment variable. As far as I could tell this is only used on the index page but I have no idea if this is correct. I haven't replaced the other plugin modules in these changes so that is still missing.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d11e7395-bca2-4e16-a486-9ddba7d12ae3)\r\n\r\n## Next

These are compiled based on the `FEATURE_QUEUE_TRYDEQUEUE_TRYPEEK` flag. \r\n- Inline documentation included\r\n- Unit tests included \r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n\r\nOne of the requirements on the linked ticket was to update all references to use these new functions. I have updated _some_ of them, only where it will eliminate a check along the lines of `queue.count > 0 && queue.Dequeue/Peek()`. There are more calls to `queue.Dequeue()` and `queue.Peek()` where it did not seem suitable to replace with the Try* equivalent, so I have left them as-is.\r\n\r\nThe `QueueExtensionsTests` suite of tests will be testing the actual methods on the Queue object when testing on any framework other than netstandard2.0 and .NET Framework, rather than testing our extensions. Should these tests be configured to only run for certain frameworks? Seems redundant to have unit tests targeting a built-in feature.

Unsure correct format to attach results.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, my linter has picked up the extra white spaces in the files I updated, which are marked as individual changes.

constructing a `StandardQueryParser` on OSes that do not support System.Console, such as iOS and Android.\r\n* `debugStream` can be set later using the setter, if needed.\r\n* The above is the same for `QueryParserTokenManager` when constructing a `QueryParser`.\r\n* See issue https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/936 for

constructing a `StandardQueryParser` on OSes that do not support System.Console, such as iOS and Android.\r\n* `debugStream` can be set later using the setter, if needed.\r\n* The above is the same for `QueryParserTokenManager` when constructing a `QueryParser`.\r\n* See issue https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/936 for details.\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-11T23:37:35Z","updated_at":"2024-07-24T22:30:46Z","closed_at":"2024-07-24T22:30:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dd3677e28b3a7e5d31289967a55e989b212051ec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/949/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/949/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/949/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/7d6240783a4a51f890c7b65fc24cd0f7589d8098","head":{"label":"TheBrainTech:master","ref":"master","sha":"7d6240783a4a51f890c7b65fc24cd0f7589d8098","user":{"login":"TheBrainTech","id":6557585,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjY1NTc1ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6557585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBrainTech","html_url":"https://github.com/TheBrainTech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBrainTech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBrainTech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBrainTech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBrainTech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBrainTech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBrainTech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBrainTech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBrainTech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBrainTech/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":813816499,"node_id":"R_kgDOMIHasw","name":"LuceneNet","full_name":"TheBrainTech/LuceneNet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TheBrainTech","id":6557585,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjY1NTc1ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6557585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBrainTech","html_url":"https://github.com/TheBrainTech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBrainTech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBrainTech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBrainTech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBrainTech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBrainTech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBrainTech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBrainTech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBrainTech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBrainTech/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TheBrainTech/LuceneNet","description":"Apache
