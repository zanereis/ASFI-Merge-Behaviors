This adds 15-20 minutes to the windows-gpu CI runs that do not have the jit cache populated. This PR changes the CUDA arch used for building in Windows CI to 7.5, which is the used for testing.\r\n\r\nFYI @ChaiBapchya @leezu \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to

changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-14T21:39:30Z","updated_at":"2020-07-23T19:17:40Z","closed_at":"2020-07-23T19:17:40Z","merged_at":"2020-07-23T19:17:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"c76593162c2a5e421243dd09a8c3cde044efaa3f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18714/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18714/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/18714/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/9d9027eba929ed59ece047e4352836344dfd2483","head":{"label":"ChaiBapchya:cp_batchnorm_fix","ref":"cp_batchnorm_fix","sha":"9d9027eba929ed59ece047e4352836344dfd2483","user":{"login":"ChaiBapchya","id":10992635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTkyNjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10992635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya","html_url":"https://github.com/ChaiBapchya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147581538,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDc1ODE1Mzg=","name":"mxnet","full_name":"ChaiBapchya/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ChaiBapchya","id":10992635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTkyNjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10992635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya","html_url":"https://github.com/ChaiBapchya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ChaiBapchya/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-14T07:01:07Z","updated_at":"2020-08-03T14:20:50Z","closed_at":"2020-08-03T14:20:50Z","merged_at":"2020-08-03T14:20:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"73d3a7bc9cef596b5cc8ba6d0e3cf21e1bc08fee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nFix #18695 \r\nHi there, this PR supports the intput whose dimension is greater than 6 for Transpose and Rollaxis.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add a new function named `TransposeExImpl` to support inputs with 6+ dimenstions for transpose and rollaxis.\r\n- [x] Add a new function named `TransposeCommonImpl`, which is called in `TransposeImpl` and `TransposeExImpl` when ndim <= 6\r\n- [x] Add the attribute `FResourceRequest` for the extra workspace to store the argument `axes`\r\n- [x] Update the unittest for transpose(in mx.nd and mx.np) and rollaxis in

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis PR is supposed to fix the issue described in #18564 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Removed the setting of `continuous_dump` when setting the profiler config.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThis PR is for fixing the issue described in #18564 . Specifically, the reason why the error happens is because the profiler config has the flag `continuous_dump` set, which would further propagate to the core function

Description ##\r\nThis PR moves to consolidate and standardize the way our data comparison routines in test_utils.py handle tolerances.  Over time, the number of these routines has grown and the approaches have diverged.  For example, two of the most frequently used routines are:\r\n```\r\ndef assert_almost_equal(a, b, rtol=None, atol=None, …):\r\n    rtol = get_rtol(rtol)\r\n    atol = get_atol(atol)\r\n    ….\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\ndef check_consistency(sym, …,  tol=None, … ):\r\n    if tol is None:\r\n        tol = {np.dtype(np.float16): 1e-1,\r\n               np.dtype(np.float32): 1e-3,\r\n               np.dtype(np.float64): 1e-5,\r\n               …}\r\n…\r\n```\r\nAs show, `assert_almost_equal()` offers separate arguments for specifying relative and absolute tolerances (by default rtol, atol = 1e-5, 1e-20), but these do not vary with dtype.  In contrast, `check_consistency()` only has one tol argument, which it uses for both atol and rtol, but the tol default is dtype-dependent.\r\n\r\nThis PR unifies these approaches by having both `check_consistency()` and `assert_almost_equal()` support rtol and atol, drawing upon the same set of dtype-dependent defaults.  The goal here is for the testing framework to make sensible tolerance choices for our unittest data comparisons when possible, rather than burden each test developer to do so.  In effect, this PR addresses the current codebase TODO in test_utils.py:\r\n```\r\ndef get_rtol(rtol=None):\r\n    \"\"\"Get default numerical threshold for regression test.\"\"\"\r\n    # _TODO: get from env variable, different threshold might\r\n    # be needed for different device and dtype\r\n    return 1e-5 if rtol is None else rtol\r\n```\r\nWhile I believe setting tolerances via env var is not appropriate, test tolerances should be a function of the dtype and device (i.e. context).  A first application for this concept is in support for the newly announced A100 GPU with its TensorFloat-32 (TF32) mode of computation.  The A100 will by default round the mantissa of float32 GEMM and Convolution inputs to a float16 precision.  Therefore, although operator i/o’s might be float32, the “effective dtype” for the purposes of tolerance selection is float16.  By consolidating the tolerance handling logic, this PR can now easily incorporate an `effective_dtype(dat)` routine based on context, so that unittests can run 32-bit models and seamlessly apply the appropriate tolerances for each context, be it A100 or non-A100.\r\n\r\nThis PR was developed on an in-house CI system that runs on many GPU architectures, including the A100.  As part of the PR development, some unittests were modified so that now all tests pass on the A100.  These tests had typically explicitly hard-coded a tolerance appropriate for a float32 test.  The modification for those tests involved dropping the fixed tolerance, allowing this PR’s adaptive context- and dtype-dependent tolerance selection logic to take over.\r\n\r\nThanks to @Kh4L for supplying the GEMM-flag adaptations for TF32 that are part of this PR.\r\nThanks also to @drivanov for his prior efforts to adapt `assert_almost_equal()` to work directly on ndarrays, thereby enabling context-dependent default tolerance selection.\r\n\r\n@ptrendx @eric-haibin-lin @marcoabreu\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n-

Description ##\r\nCurrently models with dynamic shape operator(s) are executed imperatively even when hybridized. This is because we cannot completely infer shapes for such a graph, and without doing that we cannot push the graph to engine for static execution. This can lead to poor performance when compared to the non-hybridized case.\r\n\r\nIn this PR we introduce a special graph partitioning pass for such graphs. In this pass, subgraphs are created that contain only static shape operators. These subgraphs allow shape inference and can be pushed to engine for static execution and better performance. This graph pass is triggered only once during the first forward execution after the graph is hybridized and the check for dynamic shape op passes. It makes use of the existing graph partitioning algorithm of MXNet and defines a subgraph property to specialize for this use case. The subgraph property contains the following important functions:\r\n1. `Select` - determines which operator goes in subgraph. Static shape operators can be identified by checking for `FInferShape` attribute. Some operators do not support the backward pass when present inside a subgraph #18823 and hence are excluded here. \r\n2. `PrePartition` - helps copy information from external `CachedOp` to the internal ones to set flags like `static_alloc`, `static_shape`, `data_indices` and `param_indices`.\r\n3. `InitSubgraphInputs` - creates a map of `isArg` for each node, that helps in distinguishing `data_indices` from `param_indices`. These indices help optimize the static execution of subgraphs and improve performance.\r\n4. `CreateSubgraphNode` - Sets the `CachedOp` flags and creates the `CachedOp` corresponding to the subgraph.\r\n\r\nThis PR also makes some optimizations to graph execution in presence of subgraphs. Currently MXNet converts all inputs from `MKL-DNN` format to regular format if the op is not an `MKL-DNN` operator. This also happens for the case of internal `CachedOps`, where inputs are converted to regular format and then re-converted to `MKL-DNN` format for all `MKL-DNN` operators inside the `CachedOp`. This PR optimizes these unnecessary format conversions.\r\n\r\n`CachedOp` requires at least one external input during it’s forward pass. This leads to an error if the subgraph formed contains no external inputs (for example, when inputs are generated randomly using an operator and that operator is included in the subgraph). This PR handles such cases by removing the first operator (in topological order) from the subgraph and treating it as an external input. This approach is chosen over discarding the entire subgraph as it lets all other operators to still be part of the subgraph and benefit from static execution. This functionality is triggered by a flag `ensure_CachedOp_input` set in the subgraph property, and can be used by any other subgraph property in a similar fashion.\r\n\r\nThe tables below give a performance comparison between hybridized and non-hybridized cases for following three dynamic shape operators when run along a static shape network. This PR does not affect models without dynamic shapes, so there is no impact to the general case. Here are the affected cases we tested:\r\n1. a regular (with no subgraphs of its own) dynamic shape op: `boolean_mask`\r\n2. control flow op: `_cond`\r\n3. control flow op: `_while_loop`\r\n\r\n## ResNet-152 with `boolean_mask` op\r\n### CPU\r\n\r\nAlloc/Shape | HYBRIDIZED (this PR), ms | HYBRIDIZED (MASTER), ms | NON-HYBRIDIZED, ms\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\nTrue/True | 186.79 | 217.73 | 297.14\r\nTrue/False | 220.15 | 232.59 | 297.14\r\nFalse/False | 225.70 | 219.38 | 297.14\r\n\r\n### GPU\r\nAlloc/Shape | HYBRIDIZED (this PR), ms | HYBRIDIZED (MASTER), ms | NON-HYBRIDIZED, ms\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\nTrue/True | 76.59 | 108.15 | 211.24\r\nTrue/False | 109.20 | 108.28 | 211.24\r\nFalse/False | 118.20 | 108.27 | 211.24\r\n\r\n## ResNet152-v2 with `_cond` op\r\n### CPU\r\nAlloc/Shape | HYBRIDIZED (this PR), ms | HYBRIDIZED (MASTER), ms | NON-HYBRIDIZED, ms\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\nTrue/True | 191.82 | 220.73 | 295.89\r\nTrue/False | 225.57 | 247.35 | 295.89\r\nFalse/False | 231.04 | 247.11 | 295.89\r\n\r\n### GPU\r\nAlloc/Shape | HYBRIDIZED (this PR), ms | HYBRIDIZED (MASTER), ms | NON-HYBRIDIZED, ms\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\nTrue/True | 77.65 | 120.67 | 207.41\r\nTrue/False | 113.07 | 112.91 | 207.41\r\nFalse/False | 120.92 | 113.19 | 207.41\r\n\r\n## ResNet152-v2 with `_while_loop` op\r\n### CPU\r\nAlloc/Shape | HYBRIDIZED (this PR), ms | HYBRIDIZED (MASTER), ms | NON-HYBRIDIZED, ms\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\nTrue/True | 191.59 | 226.1 | 296.24\r\nTrue/False | 225.22 | 223.8 | 296.24\r\nFalse/False | 231.03 | 226.3 | 296.24\r\n\r\n### GPU\r\nAlloc/Shape | HYBRIDIZED (this PR), ms | HYBRIDIZED (MASTER), ms | NON-HYBRIDIZED, ms\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\nTrue/True | 80.27 | 121.27 | 225.49\r\nTrue/False | 117.51 | 121.16 | 225.49\r\nFalse/False | 126.54 | 121.03 | 225.49\r\n\r\nCurrently all control flow operators (`_foreach`, `_cond` and `_while_loop`) are by default categorized as dynamic shape operators.

well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

Description ##\r\nDue to Apache license issue, there was an update to the installation guide on `/get_started` page in #18487 . The new \"build from source\" guide extracted important instructions of how to build MXNet, however, the removal of many docs left many blank path in installation guide widget. It has a bad UX, because users could click down a configuration path and find nothing useful ( blank content ). \r\n\r\n**Bug description**\r\n1. Go to https://mxnet.apache.org/get_started?\r\n2. See installation widget, **click** the following buttons: Linux -> Scala/Java/Clojure... -> CPU/GPU\r\n3. Nothing shows up\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nShow \"build from source\" notification\r\n\r\nThis is due to the wrong structure of HTML nodes. This PR fixes this issue by restructuring the HTML nodes, and removed the empty path so that users will be notified to \"build from source\" as soon as there is nothing down the path.\r\n\r\n##

Description ##\r\n#16848 \r\nDelete the tests which may cause bug because of the following reasons:\r\n1. There are differences about type inference between NumPy and Deep Numpy when there's a input with shape ():\r\nIf both inputs of np are of floating number types, the output is the more precise type, while onp will use the type of the matrix with higher dimension.\r\n```python\r\nfrom mxnet import np, npx\r\nnpx.set_np()\r\nimport numpy as _np\r\n\r\nmx_test_x1 = np.random.uniform(-2, 2, (2,3)).astype(np.float32)\r\nmx_test_x2 = np.random.uniform(-2, 2, ()).astype(np.float16)\r\n\r\nnp_out = _np.mod(mx_test_x1.asnumpy(), mx_test_x2.asnumpy()) # float16\r\nmx_out = np.mod(mx_test_x1, mx_test_x2) # float32\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. As for logical ops, NumPy also has a weird behavior.\r\n```python\r\nfrom mxnet import np, npx\r\nnpx.set_np()\r\nimport numpy as _np\r\n\r\na = np.array([[1.441]], dtype = np.float16)\r\nb = np.array(1.4413278, dtype = np.float32)\r\nc = np.array([1.4413278], dtype = np.float32)\r\n\r\nnp.greater(a,b), np.greater(a,c) # True True\r\n_np.greater(a.asnumpy(),b.asnumpy()), _np.greater(a.asnumpy(),c.asnumpy()) # False True\r\nnp.less_equal(a,b), np.less_equal(a,c) # False False\r\n_np.less_equal(a.asnumpy(),b.asnumpy()), _np.less_equal(a.asnumpy(),c.asnumpy()) # True False\r\n```\r\nDisable mixed type test for tvm ops\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-04T16:11:12Z","updated_at":"2020-07-28T07:11:26Z","closed_at":"2020-07-28T07:11:20Z","merged_at":"2020-07-28T07:11:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"7908d7eb56fc9d20c12afffd8ea592b959b80bfc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nAs reported in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/18600, there're some failures related to numpy operators with numpy 1.19.0 (which was released on Jun 21, 2020). Since numpy doesn't follow semantic versioning, and it requires more integration/functionality tests to make sure MXNet is compatible to the latest numpy version. Before all this works are completed, this PR adds constraint to numpy version < 1.19.0 to enable CI pipeline.\r\n\r\n@szha @TaoLv @leezu

Description ##\r\nOn master website api page, currently all language binding api reference links are redirected to v1.6 docs. But only the redirect for Julia does not work as expect. The same rewrite rule that works on a preview host behaves differently on MXNet website. https://mxnet.apache.org/api\r\nAfter investigation, I found only julia's folder structure changed (was removed) while other languages still preserve the folder with API docs removed and tutorials left. And how Apache's server redirect Julia query is `/api/julia/docs/api/` => `/api/julia.html/docs/api/`, which looks like it searches for `julia` folder first and do not find it, then it try to look for `julia.html` which exists, this redirect executes before our rewrite rules takes effect. While a preview host can't reproduce this with same `htaccess` file, so it is possible a higher level rewrite rule Apache Infra team defined in their server.\r\n\r\nTo fix this problem, we can 1. put an empty Julia folder and test the result 2. Hard coded the link\r\nIn this PR, method 2 is implemented. It hardcoded the endpoint of julia API and tutorials on master directly to `/versions/1.6/api/julia/docs/api`, which should be reverted once new Julia docs completes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duplicate `.htaccess` files in each version could also make the redirect work not as expect. Still investigating.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID

Description ##\r\nMilestone 2 of #18548 -  Build user feedback widget based Google Analytics on MXNet website.\r\nThis PR implements a website widget to collect user feedback which can be added to any tutorials and API pages. It will be attached to the end of the page with 2 clickable button with responses YES and NO. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-06-29 at 1 40 52 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23468760/86061441-ae565c00-ba1b-11ea-9c7d-b5d67c771b98.png\">\r\n\r\nOnce user clicks on a response button, it hides the widget and show \"Thanks for you feedback!\" and fire a google analytics event with relating data to record this feedback. The report of user feedback can be viewed on Google Analytics console, under `Behavior` => `Events`. Google Analytics provide 3 available fields for an event and below is how we define it.\r\n```bash\r\nCategory: \"Did this page help you?\"    # Common name for all feedback event\r\nLabel: $URI_PATH     # The URI where event was fired, for example \"api/scala/docs/tutorials/io\"\r\nAction: yes or no     # User feedback \r\nValue: 1 or 0  # used to calculate the satisfactory percentage of feedback\r\n```\r\nTo add feedback widget to website:\r\n+ On main site: Found the target markdown or html page, add `feedback: true`  in its Jekyll front matter\r\n+ Python microsite: all pages are enabled automatically\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID

Description ##\r\nWhen doing calibration with variable input shapes, a new `executor` will be created [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/v1.6.x/python/mxnet/executor.py#L468) in the case of the current input has different shape compared to the previous one. While the `callback` function is only bound to the very first `executor` instead of passed down to the succeeding `executors` which shares the same symbol.\r\nThis PR enables passing down the `callback` function, to address the calibration skipping issue.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv @ChaiBapchya @szha

Description ##\r\nAs described in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/18280#issuecomment-627010252, MXNet currently contains too many CUDA kernels, that affect negatively compile time, size of the resulting binary (resulting in issues like #17045 and #18205), and GPU memory consumption (as all of those kernels need to be loaded during the first GPU context creation to GPU memory).\r\n\r\nThe reason of those problems is the number of templates that need to be instantiated, especially in the case of NumPy operators which need to accept different input/output types - this results in multiple nested `MSHADOW_TYPE_SWITCH` macros and great increase in the number of kernels generated, most of them pretty much never used. For example, executing this command:\r\n```\r\ncuobjdump -symbols -arch sm_70 /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/mxnet/libmxnet.so | grep GLOBAL | wc -l\r\n```\r\non the nightly build of mxnet-cu102 from 6/25 shows 69169 kernels (the same command executed on the library built with this PR at the time of writing gives 51511 kernels).\r\n\r\nThe proposed approach is to use RTC (runtime compilation) in order to generate the needed kernels at runtime. This saves the ahead-of-time compilation time and binary size as well as the GPU memory utilization (since only the needed kernels are generated, not all combinations).\r\n\r\nTo test the impact on binary size and memory consumption reduction I compiled MXNet for 5 GPU architectures (5.2, 6.0, 6.1, 7.0, 7.5) using CUDA 11 both from the head of this PR and from the latest master commit included (f872b4340).\r\nBinary size reduction: 292 MB (from 2 GB to 1.7 GB)\r\nIdle GPU memory consumption reduction: 96 MB (from 1442 MB to 1346 MB)\r\nIdle GPU memory consumption reduction was checked by launching Python interpreter and checking GPU memory consumption after calling:\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\na = mx.nd.zeros((1,), ctx=mx.gpu())\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR uses that approach to handle elementwise and broadcast kernels (as well as their backward), which constitute a big portion of the total number of kernels in MXNet.\r\n\r\nFYI @leezu @sxjscience @eric-haibin-lin \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n - RTC is now required for using CUDA in MXNet\r\n - Unary, binary, binary with scalar, binary broadcast ops and their backward counterparts were changed to use RTC \r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Things left to do:\r\n\r\n   - [x] Test the performance impact of cache lookup for kernel code\r\n   - [x] Convert `MixedUnaryBackward` functions\r\n   - [x] Update PR description with the change in GPU memory utilization and binary size resulting from this PR\r\n\r\n - After this PR the next step would be to use the same approach for reduce kernels - this PR already contains a ground work for this as reduction was needed for backward of broadcast ops, but it does not apply that path to standalone reduction ops. Grepping for `reduce_kernel` in the symbols visible in libmxnet.so after application of this PR:\r\n```\r\ncuobjdump -symbols -arch sm_70 /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/mxnet/libmxnet.so | grep GLOBAL | grep reduce_kernel | wc -l\r\n```\r\ngives 12057 entries. This would also help with reducing the amount of code duplication that this PR introduces (to maintain both RTC and non-RTC paths).\r\n

Description ##\r\nA draft!\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

Description ##\r\nThis PR removes the graph executor bind/forward/backward C_API. Going forward, we will use cached_op_create/invoke in favor of graph executor c APIs. This PR also removes all language bindings except for python. The language bindings will be supported continuously in the mxnet 1.x branch. To add back language bindings, we shall use the new cached op c APIs. \r\n\r\n#17676 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-20T20:23:54Z","updated_at":"2020-06-23T16:43:27Z","closed_at":"2020-06-22T06:02:14Z","merged_at":"2020-06-22T06:02:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"2fbec60e0da8832d71f7e3f93d4407dbca745e51","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gigasquid","id":340299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDI5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid","html_url":"https://github.com/gigasquid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"iblislin","id":761623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTYyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/761623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iblislin","html_url":"https://github.com/iblislin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iblislin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iblislin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iblislin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iblislin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iblislin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iblislin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iblislin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iblislin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iblislin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"leezu","id":946903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu","html_url":"https://github.com/leezu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":

The issue will try to be resolved in another PR.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-19T13:23:00Z","updated_at":"2020-07-04T01:14:05Z","closed_at":"2020-07-04T01:14:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"18486fb2feb135a4c7dbd688fec32137d0d38dd0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18594/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18594/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/18594/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/f0637575ddb403f38c16df033706e4f6442c66ff","head":{"label":"JiangZhaoh:fix_ufunc_scalar_op_bug","ref":"fix_ufunc_scalar_op_bug","sha":"f0637575ddb403f38c16df033706e4f6442c66ff","user":{"login":"JiangZhaoh","id":54654391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjU0Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54654391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiangZhaoh","html_url":"https://github.com/JiangZhaoh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiangZhaoh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiangZhaoh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiangZhaoh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiangZhaoh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiangZhaoh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiangZhaoh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiangZhaoh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiangZhaoh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiangZhaoh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":213588024,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTM1ODgwMjQ=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"JiangZhaoh/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JiangZhaoh","id":54654391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjU0Mzkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54654391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiangZhaoh","html_url":"https://github.com/JiangZhaoh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiangZhaoh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiangZhaoh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiangZhaoh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiangZhaoh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiangZhaoh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiangZhaoh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiangZhaoh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiangZhaoh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiangZhaoh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JiangZhaoh/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nFix #17244 . It prevents to land on any unsupported version of installation guide on `get started` page. \r\n\r\n**How the fix works:**\r\nIt grabs the available versions from the version drop down, and checks if the target version is within the available versions before updating the installation guide. If invalid version is specified, update it to the newest version instead.\r\n\r\n**Bug description:**\r\nCurrent `Get Started` page has no check if the version is valid. While we removed `master` from the version dropdown, users can still see the contents by typing `version=master` in browser. And what is more, any string can be typed in browser and the `Get Started` page will show the wired page.

Description ##\r\nThe functionality provided by `GPUPooledStorageManager` and `GPUPooledRoundedStorageManager` classes was re-implemented. This allowed using caching not only for the `GPU`, but also for the `CPU` and  `CPU_Pinned` memory. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Class `PooledStorageManager` implemented as a template:\r\n```cpp\r\ntemplate<typename BucketingStrategy, typename StoringMethod>\r\nclass PooledStorageManager : public StorageManager,\r\n public BucketingStrategy, public StoringMethod { ... }\r\n```\r\nwhich \r\n- allows using different methods/algorithms for bucketing and storing cached data;\r\n- eliminate duplication of code for different memory types: `gpu`, `cpu`,` cpu_pinned`; \r\n\r\n- [x] The default Storage Manager for CPU, CPU_Pinned memory will be `Pooled` and not `Naive` as before.\r\n\r\n- [x] Duplicated code related to the profiling and some parameter checks (`handle.size` / `handle.dptr`) which was spread inside the different Storage Manages now is located in corresponding methods of `StorageImpl` class.\r\n\r\n- [x] New environment variables which define the bucketing parameters for `CPU`, `CPU_Pinned` memory used with the Pooled Storage Managers are implemented and described in `**docs/static_site/src/pages/api/faq/env_var.md**`\r\n\r\n- [x] If needed, the user can \r\n- set MXNET_USE_NAIVE_STORAGE_MANAGERS=1 and the Naive Storage Managers for all types of memory\r\n- use **MXNET_[XXX]_MEM_POOL_TYPE=Unpooled**, with XXX is one of {GPU, CPU, CPU_PINNED} and start using Native storage Manager for that specific memory type.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nOur experiments show a 2.2-2.3x improvement in training time when using `CPU` /` CPU_Pinned` memory with new Pooled Storage Managers compared to their usage with Naive (non-pooled) Storage Manager's\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-18T02:11:07Z","updated_at":"2020-09-10T00:34:48Z","closed_at":"2020-07-16T23:57:59Z","merged_at":"2020-07-16T23:57:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"3ef00b8840c05c49118705f6fd9663ebb951f3a1","assignee":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18582/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18582/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/18582/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/97dfc823d8b89751ff8be459a0357195e383a23d","head":{"label":"andrei5055:pooled_storage_manager","ref":"pooled_storage_manager","sha":"97dfc823d8b89751ff8be459a0357195e383a23d","user":{"login":"andrei5055","id":7293680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyOTM2ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7293680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei5055","html_url":"https://github.com/andrei5055","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei5055/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei5055/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei5055/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei5055/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei5055/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei5055/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei5055/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei5055/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei5055/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":271843162,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzE4NDMxNjI=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"andrei5055/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andrei5055","id":7293680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyOTM2ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7293680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei5055","html_url":"https://git

Description ##\r\nThis is one of a series of PRs that removes graph executor for better maintenance of MXNet execution backend. The graph executor will be still maintained in mxnet 1.x.  Also, disabled two tests that failed with cached op: \r\n- https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/13193  (sparse csr binary op)\r\n- https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/18575  (one variant of contrib.while_loop)\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the python mx.executor.Executor class is replaced with an implementation with CachedOp backend. The methods `Symbol.bind` and `Symbol.simple_bind` are replaced with `Symbol._bind` and `Symbol._simple_bind` that return the new python Executor class.\r\n\r\nNote that the implementation is only meant for a way to switch to cached op when testing all existing operators (which were all tested with the graph executor in MXNet 1.x). Users are not expected to use the new python Executor for performance sensitive inference/training workloads. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, since the quantization flow is only implemented for the old graph executor, the APIs are removed in this PR. Finally, two contrib ops are also removed in this PR (contrib.SparseEmbedding and contrib.ifft). \r\n\r\nThe PR also removes the perl binding, which uses the old cached op c_api. In upcoming PRs, I'll remove the graph executor c_api and other language bindings, too. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-17T16:12:52Z","updated_at":"2020-06-20T21:49:59Z","closed_at":"2020-06-20T21:49:59Z","merged_at":"2020-06-20T21:49:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"c1098aa33d6795f84a19601d0319d5bb8e19f317","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"sergeykolychev","id":25470168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDcwMTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25470168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev","html_url":"https://github.com/sergeykolychev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18579/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18579/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/18579/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/c1cf4b4d875702ae725126c3662b46090d8d6a79","head":{"label":"eric-haibin-lin:exec-v2","ref":"exec-v2","sha":"c1cf4b4d875702ae725126c3662b46090d8d6a79","user":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https:

Description ##\r\nFix #18567 . Original posted from https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17982#issuecomment-634850809. When clicking an anchor on \"contribute\" page, the landing position shifts.\r\nThe cause: The header's position is `fix` which takes it out of normal flow. But the anchors are not aware of it and not counting the height of the header, which leads to the overlap between anchor's landing spot and the header.\r\nThis is a common problem from fixed header, here is a bug fix discussed in this article https://css-tricks.com/hash-tag-links-padding/. Fix this issue by adding extra padding to each anchor's headings to avoid overlapping with header.\r\n@ChaiBapchya \r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable

Description ##\r\nDuring training, MxNet reinitiates data stored in the instances of `NDArray` class by making a lot of `NDArray` constructor's calls and assigning the newly constructed objects to the existing ones.\r\nFirst of all, it is not very effective, because \r\n\r\n- (a) usually we call some `NDArray` constructor AND NDArray` copy constructor \r\n- (b) after each such call the NDArray destructor will be called.\r\n\r\nSecond, lots of such calls are done \"under the hood\" and are not effective at all. For instance, the usage of \r\n```cpp\r\n          std::vector<NDArray> inputs, outputs\r\n```\r\nin lambda expressions generates more `NDArray` constructor calls than it's actually necessary:\r\n\r\n- 3 times more for `PushFCompute(...)` and \r\n- 1.5 time more for `PushFComputeEx(...)`,  `PushOperator(...)`;\r\n \r\nThird, it's hard to debug.\r\n\r\nTo fix this problem we propose to use \r\n\r\n- the newly implemented `NDArray::Init(...), NDArray::ReInit(...)` methods\r\n- `std::vector<NDArray *> inputs, outputs;` instead of `std::vector<NDArray> inputs, outputs;`\r\n\r\nOur experiments show that these changes reduce the number of `NDArray` constructor calls by approx. 80%:\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] The usage of\r\n```\r\nstd::vector<NDArray> inputs, outputs\r\n```\r\nin `PushFCompute(...)` , `PushFComputeEx(...)`,  `PushOperator(...)`\r\nwas replaced by \r\n```cpp\r\nstd::vector<NDArray> inputs, outputs\r\n```\r\n- [x] The usage of macros, similar to the following ones, which are defined in different ways  for fifferent values of `MXNET_USE_MKLDNN` simplifies the code\r\n```cpp\r\n#if MXNET_USE_MKLDNN == 1\r\n#define INVALIDATE_OUTPUTS(outputs, req) InvalidateOutputs(&outputs, req)\r\n#define INVALIDATE_OUTPUTS_COND(cond, outputs, req) if (cond) INVALIDATE_OUTPUTS(outputs, req)\r\n// add for mkldnn OP + no mkldnn OP\r\n#define CREATE_DEFAULT_INPUTS(cond, attrs, func_call) \\\r\n if (cond) { \\\r\n const auto is_mkldnn = Op::GetAttr<bool>(\"TIsMKLDNN\"); \\\r\n if (!is_mkldnn.get(attrs.op, false)) func_call; \\\r\n }\r\n\r\n#else\r\n#define INVALIDATE_OUTPUTS(outputs, ...)       // empty macros\r\n#define INVALIDATE_OUTPUTS_COND(outputs, ...)  // empty macro\r\n#define CREATE_DEFAULT_INPUTS(input, ...)      // empty macro\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n- [x] Implementation of constructor:\r\n```cpp\r\n  NDArray(const NDArrayStorageType stype, const mxnet::TShape &shape, Context ctx,\r\n          bool delay_alloc = true, int dtype = mshadow::default_type_flag,\r\n          std::vector<int> aux_types = {}, mxnet::ShapeVector aux_shapes = {},\r\n          mxnet::TShape storage_shape = mxnet::TShape(mshadow::Shape1(0)));\r\n```\r\nwas moved into newly implemented:\r\n```cpp\r\nvoid NDArray::ReInit(const NDArrayStorageType stype, const mxnet::TShape &shape,\r\n Context ctx, int dtype, bool delay_alloc, const std::vector<int> *pAux_types,\r\n const mxnet::ShapeVector *pAux_shapes, const mxnet::TShape *pStorage_shapes)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\nThe sanity build already has a timeout of 180 minutes. The staggered full build pipeline currently has a timeout of 20 minutes, but we are seeing timeouts because sometimes the sanity build takes longer than this (because of having to rebuild docker caches for branches other than master.) This results in the rest of the builds failing to get triggered. Increasing this timeout to 180 minutes allows the sanity build to complete and won't prevent the rest of the builds from being
