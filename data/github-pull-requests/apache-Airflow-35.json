Previously, the deferral trigger would be added regardless of the `wait_for_completion` setting, leading to unintended behavior.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made:\r\n- Updated the condition for deferring to check both `deferrable` and `wait_for_completion`.\r\n- Adjusted the condition for synchronous waiting to occur only when `wait_for_completion=True` and `deferrable=False`.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease review the changes, and let me know if further adjustments are needed.\r\n\r\nCloses:

It is very common for users to want to run a DAG for the first time either immediately, with a logical date of the past run that would have occurred most recently, or to wait until the next run time and then begin. The former is only possible if you set catchup to False and the latter is not possible without knowing ahead of time when that next run would be and hardcoding the start time for the DAG (which is not feasible when doing dev/text/prod environment promotion of the same DAG file). \r\n\r\nIt is also very common to set the start_date to a dynamic function that calculates a date in the recent past, such as days_ago(1), which can bite you if you're used to doing that (or have coded it into a DAG factory pattern) and then you set up your first monthly DAG. The existing timetables behavior is to silently miss the run, which makes it even worse.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the ability to set start_date to `None` and get the intuitive behavior of running the last run if that run would have happened in the very recent past (10% of the distance between DAG runs) or to wait for the next run otherwise. It also allows using the `run_immediately` parameter to specify always running the last run, always waiting for the next run, or passing a timedelta to exactly control what \"recent past\" means for this particular DAG. Setting start_date to `None` is a much more accurate and clear indication of author intent that `days_ago(x)`.\r\n\r\nI hope that if this is widely adopted, we can stop seeing users miss DAG runs or using dynamic start dates.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

This seems like a such a basic use case that it would make sense to include. There is the TimeDeltaSensor, but this sensor is based on the data interval of the DAG run, not the start time of the task.\r\n\r\nI have observed some Airflow users using BashOperators that sleep for a specified time for want of this sensor, which would be strictly better, especially when run as deferrable.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**^ Add

#21004, cloudant is no longer developed and ibmcloudant is the active replacement\r\n\r\nThis is a breaking change to the provider in the following ways:\r\n\r\n- `get_conn` now returns a `CloudantV1` object with different function names than the previous `Cloudant` object; the mappings from the old library functions to the new are outlined here: https://github.com/cloudant/python-cloudant/blob/master/MIGRATION.md#reference-table\r\n- `get_conn` now directly returns a usable object instead of a context manager; `with`-block syntax is no longer needed\r\n- The connection is now checked for a mandatory `host` value that functions as the Cloudant account name (previously the host field was optional, but could cause a runtime failure)\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-17T18:36:40Z","updated_at":"2024-09-06T11:15:37Z","closed_at":"2024-09-06T11:02:20Z","merged_at":"2024-09-06T11:02:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"caa94fa4665bf4a63e8cbf3b0344481af3787a06","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"o-nikolas","id":65743084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzQzMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65743084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas","html_url":"https://github.com/o-nikolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"hussein-awala","id":21311487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzExNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21311487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala","html_url":"https://github.com/hussein-awala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"

To take account of possible container replication at deployment time, a `Task` and `Container` retrieval step has been added, in addition to the specific `retrieve_output` functionality.\r\n\r\nThe modifications were tested with the Dag provided below:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.utils.dates import days_ago\r\nfrom datetime import timedelta\r\n\r\nfrom docker import types\r\nfrom airflow.providers.docker.operators.docker import DockerOperator\r\nfrom airflow.providers.docker.operators.docker_swarm import DockerSwarmOperator\r\n\r\nparams = {\r\n    'dag_id': 'test_xcom_docker_docker_swarm',\r\n    'catchup': False,\r\n    'max_active_runs': 1,\r\n    'default_args': {\r\n        'owner': 'airflow',\r\n        'start_date': days_ago(1),\r\n        'retries': 1,\r\n        'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nwith DAG(**params) as dag:\r\n    write_xcom_docker = DockerOperator(\r\n        task_id='write_xcom_docker',\r\n        image='python:latest',\r\n        api_version='auto',\r\n        command=\"\"\"python -c '\r\n\r\nimport os\r\nimport pickle\r\n\r\ncapitals = {\r\n  \"Canada\": \"Ottawa\", \r\n  \"England\": \"London\",\r\n  \"France\": \"Paris\",\r\n  \"Germany\": \"Berlin\", \r\n}\r\n\r\nfile_path = \"/tmp/variable.pickle\"\r\nwith open(file_path, \"wb+\") as file:\r\n    pickle.dump(capitals, file)\r\n\r\n    '\r\n    \"\"\",\r\n        retrieve_output=True,\r\n        retrieve_output_path='/tmp/variable.pickle')\r\n\r\n    write_xcom_docker_swarm = DockerSwarmOperator(\r\n        task_id='write_xcom_docker_swarm',\r\n        image='python:latest',\r\n        api_version='auto',\r\n        command=\"\"\"python -c '\r\n\r\nimport os\r\nimport pickle\r\n\r\ncapitals = {\r\n  \"Canada\": \"Ottawa\", \r\n  \"England\": \"London\",\r\n  \"France\": \"Paris\",\r\n  \"Germany\": \"Berlin\", \r\n}\r\n\r\nfile_path = \"/tmp/variable.pickle\"\r\nwith open(file_path, \"wb+\") as file:\r\n    pickle.dump(capitals, file)\r\n\r\n    '\r\n    \"\"\",\r\n        retrieve_output=True,\r\n        retrieve_output_path='/tmp/variable.pickle')\r\n\r\n    write_xcom_docker_swarm_replicas = DockerSwarmOperator(\r\n        task_id='write_xcom_docker_swarm_replicas',\r\n        image='python:latest',\r\n        api_version='auto',\r\n        command=\"\"\"python -c '\r\n\r\nimport os\r\nimport pickle\r\n\r\ncapitals = {\r\n  \"Canada\": \"Ottawa\", \r\n  \"England\": \"London\",\r\n  \"France\": \"Paris\",\r\n  \"Germany\": \"Berlin\", \r\n}\r\n\r\nfile_path = \"/tmp/variable.pickle\"\r\nwith open(file_path, \"wb+\") as file:\r\n    pickle.dump(capitals, file)\r\n\r\n    '\r\n    \"\"\",\r\n        retrieve_output=True,\r\n        retrieve_output_path='/tmp/variable.pickle',\r\n        mode=types.ServiceMode(mode=\"replicated\", replicas=2))\r\n\r\nwrite_xcom_docker >> write_xcom_docker_swarm >> write_xcom_docker_swarm_replicas\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere the results:\r\n- `DockerOperator`:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bb550a3-62ba-4a53-a119-f17bf0211612)\r\n- `DockerSwarmOperator` without replication: \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4c89d4d-0fdf-4388-ba81-4ae5191e9e60)\r\n- `DockerSwarmOperator` with `replicas=2`: \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b4c85ba-15a6-478c-ad3b-63b0831f2a6b)\r\nAs `replicas=2` in the Service configuration inside the DAG, 2 files were loaded inside the `return_value` XCOM.\r\n\r\nIf needed, I can create a specific PR for the `v2-10-test` branch !\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

`DataprocCreateBatchOperator`:\r\n- significantly refactored the `execute()` method for decreasing its accumulated complexity and code duplication.\r\n- made the `batch_id` parameter optional as it is supported by API\r\n- made the `region` parameter required because (1) it is required by the API, and (2) it was already required de-facto because the operator used to raise and exception manually: `raise AirflowException(\"Region should be set here\")`\r\n- added a specific error message to the operator logs (in both deferrable=True|False modes), so it would be more convenient for users to debug their batch jobs using the operator logs directly.\r\n\r\nAlso additionally slight refactored Dataproc system tests:\r\n- reduced parallelism\r\n- added retry to cluster creation tasks in a hope to suppress [the error](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-vm-creation)\r\n\r\nThis PR also rolls back changes in pre-commit hook made for Dataflow system tests. From now those changes rea not needed.","created_at":"2024-08-16T11:10:30Z","updated_at":"2024-08-16T17:12:14Z","closed_at":"2024-08-16T17:12:14Z","merged_at":"2024-08-16T17:12:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"55d49cc12f31f669a5bd2b3a4b8e66e97a406077","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

2.10.0 has the new feature to use multiple executors. The value schema check in the current Helm chart doesn't allow this because it has a strict list of allowed values. I removed this enum check list to enable custom and combinations of executors.\r\n\r\nAnother change is the `executor` label in the scheduler Deployment. I removed this label because it has no functional use. Reasons are:\r\n\r\n1. Characters such as `:` are not allowed in label values. This prevents me from using short names such as `airflow.providers.amazon.aws.executors.ecs.AwsEcsExecutor:AwsEcsExecutor`\r\n2. The label value can have max 63 characters. Even if (1) is okay, we still need to do some string truncating.\r\n\r\n~Another change is the `executor` label in the scheduler Deployment. Because Kubernetes allows max 63 characters for label values, and hybrid executor values can easily exceed this limit, therefore I added a `trunc -63` to prevent this. This value has no functional use AFAIK, so doing a truncate here will not cause any functional problems.~\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-16T08:57:14Z","updated_at":"2024-10-13T00:16:29Z","closed_at":"2024-10-13T00:16:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"81d8036286b36b1aa1c736947528d603b9c8176a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

#40875.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in #40875, in some cases `EcsRunTaskOperator` have missing logs in the log group specified through `awslogs_group`. When `awslogs_group` is provided, the operator pull logs from `awslogs_group` (where the ECS task logs are) and log them so that the user can see them in the UI. The issue is, somehow (and I really cannot explain why), when multiple logs from `awslogs_group` have the same timestamp, only one of them (the first one) is logged. An example to better understand:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlog_events = self._get_log_events(continuation_token)\r\nfor log_event in log_events:\r\n    self.logger.info(self.event_to_str(log_event))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `log_events` has 2 events with the same timestamp, `self.logger.info(self.event_to_str(log_event))` will run twice but will log once.\r\n\r\nAdding a delay between the logging operators \"fix\" the issue.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Without this fix, the utility of the `@dag` decorator is significantly diminished because only \"plain\" defaults (without any attached metadata to drive UI generation) can be used in the decorated function.","created_at":"2024-08-15T19:52:38Z","updated_at":"2024-10-13T00:16:29Z","closed_at":"2024-10-13T00:16:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bbc64c0bce2dc7669de5b12cf856c893482acf77","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

PR introduces support for multiple queries in the `AthenaOperator` in the AWS provider for Apache Airflow\r\n   - The `query` parameter now accepts a list of SQL strings in addition to a single string. This allows the execution of multiple queries in sequence within a single task.\r\n   - A new optional parameter `split_statements` has been added.\r\n   - The query execution logic has been refactored into a loop that processes each query individually, ensuring that all queries are executed or appropriately deferred.\r\n   - The `execute_next_query` method has been introduced to handle the deferred execution of queries. This method replaces the `execute_complete` method.\r\n\r\n**Note: I haven’t worked on tests or docs yet, I’ll proceed with those once we’re happy with the implementation.**","created_at":"2024-08-15T17:33:43Z","updated_at":"2024-11-25T00:16:39Z","closed_at":"2024-11-25T00:16:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eladkal","id":45845474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODQ1NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45845474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal","html_url":"https://github.com/eladkal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"o-nikolas","id":65743084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzQzMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65743084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas","html_url":"https://github.com/o-nikolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

This fix constructs task dependency tree without intermediate representation.\r\n\r\nPrevious memory consumption:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot@a24bae3584cb:/opt/airflow# pytest --memray tests/providers/openlineage/utils/test_utils.py::test_get_dag_tree_large_dag\r\n=========================================================================================================================================================================== test session starts ============================================================================================================================================================================\r\nplatform linux -- Python 3.12.5, pytest-8.3.2, pluggy-1.5.0 -- /usr/local/bin/python\r\ncachedir: .pytest_cache\r\nrootdir: /opt/airflow\r\nconfigfile: pyproject.toml\r\nplugins: memray-1.7.0, timeouts-1.2.1, icdiff-0.9, mock-3.14.0, rerunfailures-14.0, requests-mock-1.12.1, xdist-3.6.1, asyncio-0.23.8, anyio-4.4.0, instafail-0.5.0, cov-5.0.0, time-machine-2.15.0, custom-exit-code-0.3.0\r\nasyncio: mode=Mode.STRICT\r\nsetup timeout: 0.0s, execution timeout: 0.0s, teardown timeout: 0.0s\r\ncollected 1 item\r\n\r\ntests/providers/openlineage/utils/test_utils.py::test_get_dag_tree_large_dag PASSED                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  [100%]\r\n\r\n\r\n============================================================================================================================================================================== MEMRAY REPORT ===============================================================================================================================================================================\r\nAllocation results for tests/providers/openlineage/utils/test_utils.py::test_get_dag_tree_large_dag at the high watermark\r\n\r\n\t 📦 Total memory allocated: 5.4GiB\r\n\t 📏 Total allocations: 23\r\n\t 📊 Histogram of allocation sizes: |▁▁█  |\r\n\t 🥇 Biggest allocating functions:\r\n\t\t- _safe_get_dag_tree_view:/opt/airflow/airflow/providers/openlineage/utils/utils.py:446 -> 2.7GiB\r\n\t\t- get_tree_view:/opt/airflow/airflow/models/dag.py:2445 -> 2.7GiB\r\n\t\t- __setattr__:/opt/airflow/airflow/models/baseoperator.py:1191 -> 1.3MiB\r\n\t\t- __setattr__:/opt/airflow/airflow/models/baseoperator.py:1191 -> 1.3MiB\r\n\t\t- __setattr__:/opt/airflow/airflow/models/baseoperator.py:1191 -> 1.3MiB\r\n\r\n\r\n=================================================================================================================================================================== Warning summary.

PROD image building fails currently in non-main because it attempts to build source provider packages rather than use them from PyPi when PR is run against \"v-test\" branch.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it:\r\n\r\n* PROD images in non-main-targetted build will pull providers from PyPI rather than build them\r\n* they use PyPI constraints to install the providers\r\n* they use UV - which should speed up building of the images\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit 4d5f1c42a7873329b1b6b8b9b39db2c3033b46df)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor

PROD image building fails currently in non-main because it attempts to build source provider packages rather than use them from PyPi when PR is run against \"v-test\" branch.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it:\r\n\r\n* PROD images in non-main-targetted build will pull providers from PyPI rather than build them\r\n* they use PyPI constraints to install the providers\r\n* they use UV - which should speed up building of the images\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

This parameter allows users to specify whether the operator should fail the task if the specified file is not found on the SFTP server.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the operator would raise an exception and fail the task if the file was not found on the SFTP server. With the introduction of the `fail_on_sftp_file_not_exist` parameter, users now have the flexibility to configure the operator's behavior in such scenarios. By setting this parameter to `False`, the operator will log a warning message instead of failing the task, allowing the DAG to continue running.\r\n\r\nThis enhancement aligns with similar improvements requested for other operators, such as the `SFTPToS3Operator`.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Added the `fail_on_sftp_file_not_exist` parameter to the `SFTPToGCSOperator`.\r\n- Updated the `_copy_single_object` method to conditionally handle missing files based on the value of `fail_on_sftp_file_not_exist`.\r\n- Provided relevant test cases to ensure the new parameter functions as expected.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-14T13:43:36Z","updated_at":"2024-11-04T09:36:46Z","closed_at":"2024-11-04T09:36:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

This parameter allows users to specify whether the operator should fail the task if the specified file is not found on the SFTP server.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the operator would raise an exception and fail the task if the file was not found on the SFTP server. With the introduction of the `fail_on_sftp_file_not_exist` parameter, users now have the flexibility to configure the operator's behavior in such scenarios. By setting this parameter to `False`, the operator will log a warning message instead of failing the task, allowing the DAG to continue running.\r\n\r\nThis enhancement aligns with similar improvements requested for other operators, such as the `SFTPToS3Operator`.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Added the `fail_on_sftp_file_not_exist` parameter to the `SFTPToGCSOperator`.\r\n- Updated the `_copy_single_object` method to conditionally handle missing files based on the value of `fail_on_sftp_file_not_exist`.\r\n- Provided relevant test cases to ensure the new parameter functions as expected.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-14T12:19:13Z","updated_at":"2024-08-14T12:26:00Z","closed_at":"2024-08-14T12:25:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"40795a75793bc228ba6690d0d30cf13385456744","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

arguments 'schedule_interval' and 'timetable' are removed from both the DAG class and the `@dag` decorator.\r\n    \r\nThe default value of the 'schedule' argument (on both entities) is changed to None (i.e. a DAG will not have a schedule by default).\r\n    \r\nThe 'timetable' attribute still exists on DAG, and is now the only value that reflects the DAG's schedule. The 'schedule_interval' attribute is removed from DAG.\r\n    \r\nThe 'schedule_interval' on DagModel used to store a string representation of DAG's attribute of the same name, is now replaced by timetable_summary, which should (mostly?) work the same as before. We can fix minor UI differences as we go. Some use cases that rely on that field are also changed to use other fields instead (dataset_expression, for example, can be used to check whether a DAG is dataset-triggered).\r\n    \r\nThe API field 'schedule_interval' has also been removed since that field no longer exists in the database. This has some side effects. The field previously contains some type information for delta values, but now becomes a simple string. It is unclear if anyone really needs the information, but we can always bring it back if needed.\r\n\r\nClose

The error specifying `...is not bound to a Session;...`. We could try to somehow use `dag_maker` in this file to create `self.dag` for skipped tests. In that case, I assume the dag won't be None via passing the session to dag_maker. I may be missing some parts and adding dag_maker into the test context won't solve all issues.

Why\r\nBefore this change, we used the previous DagRun to decide which dataset events should be append to a DagRun as its `consumed_dataset_events.` However, if we delete the previous run, these DatasetEvent will be added to the next DagRun, which is confusing.\r\n\r\n## What\r\nInstead of using the timestamp of the previous run as the start time to filter dataset events, it now fetches the dataset event created after the `create_at` timestamp of `DatasetDagRunQueue`s (a.k.a DDRQ). To achieve this, we also need to ensure the first created DDRQ is no later than the creation time of a dataset event. Thus, it also passes the timestamp of the dataset event that calls `_queue_dag_run` as the `created_at` timestamp of DDRQs\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
