Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nUse the new framework to resolve the ALTER TABLE commands.\r\n\r\nThis PR also refactors ALTER TABLE logical plans such that they extend a base class `AlterTable`. Each plan now implements `def changes: Seq[TableChange]` for any table change operations.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, `UnresolvedV2Relation` and its usage is completely removed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a part of effort to make the relation lookup behavior consistent: [SPARK-29900](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdding a dedicated boss event loop group to the Netty pipeline in the External Shuffle Service to avoid the delay in channel registration.\r\n```\r\n   EventLoopGroup bossGroup = NettyUtils.createEventLoop(ioMode, 1,\r\n      conf.getModuleName() + \"-boss\");\r\n    EventLoopGroup workerGroup =  NettyUtils.createEventLoop(ioMode, conf.serverThreads(),\r\n    conf.getModuleName() + \"-server\");\r\n\r\n    bootstrap = new ServerBootstrap()\r\n      .group(bossGroup, workerGroup)\r\n      .channel(NettyUtils.getServerChannelClass(ioMode))\r\n      .option(ChannelOption.ALLOCATOR, allocator)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe have been seeing a large number of SASL authentication (RPC requests) timing out with the external shuffle service. \r\n```\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException: Timeout waiting for task.\r\n\tat org.spark-project.guava.base.Throwables.propagate(Throwables.java:160)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.network.client.TransportClient.sendRpcSync(TransportClient.java:278)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.network.sasl.SaslClientBootstrap.doBootstrap(SaslClientBootstrap.java:80)\r\n\tat

org.apache.spark.network.client.TransportClientFactory.createUnmanagedClient(TransportClientFactory.java:181)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.network.shuffle.ExternalShuffleClient.registerWithShuffleServer(ExternalShuffleClient.java:141)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManager$$anonfun$registerWithExternalShuffleServer$1.apply$mcVI$sp(BlockManager.scala:218) \r\n```\r\nThe investigation that we have done is described here:\r\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/issues/9890\r\n\r\nAfter adding `LoggingHandler` to the netty pipeline, we saw that the registration of the channel was getting delay which is because the worker threads are busy with the existing channels. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nWe have tested the patch on our clusters and with a stress testing tool. After this change, we didn't see any SASL requests timing out. Existing unit tests pass.","created_at":"2020-01-16T19:46:02Z","updated_at":"2020-01-29T21:14:18Z","closed_at":"2020-01-29T21:03:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c2684384f6e8dec5fed6b5eb603a4438987ef461","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27240/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27240/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27240/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9c6fbcb56b1204a435207078487da7e9fdab2a21","head":{"label":"otterc:SPARK-30512","ref":"SPARK-30512","sha":"9c6fbcb56b1204a435207078487da7e9fdab2a21","user":{"login":"otterc","id":4690923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2OTA5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4690923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/otterc","html_url":"https://github.com/otterc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otterc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otterc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otterc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otterc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otterc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otterc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otterc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otterc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otterc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":234393297,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzQzOTMyOTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"otterc/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"otterc","id":4690923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2OTA5MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4690923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/otterc","html_url":"https://github.com/otterc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otterc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otterc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otterc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otterc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otterc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otterc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otterc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otterc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/otterc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/otterc/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to fix the bug reported in SPARK-30530.

In the case `UnivocityParser.convert()` always throws `BadRecordException` independently from the result of applying filters.\r\n\r\nFor the described case, I propose to save the exception in `badRecordException` and continue value conversion according to `parsedSchema`.

Consider `OFFSET` as the special case of `LIMIT`. For example:\r\n`SELECT * FROM a limit 10;` similar to `SELECT * FROM a limit 10 offset 0;`\r\n`SELECT * FROM a offset 10;` similar to `SELECT * FROM a limit -1 offset 10;`\r\n**2**. Because the current implement of `LIMIT` has good performance. For example:\r\n`SELECT * FROM a limit 10;` parsed to the logic plan as below:\r\n```\r\nGlobalLimit (limit = 10)\r\n    |--LocalLimit (limit = 10)\r\n```\r\nand then the physical plan as below:\r\n```\r\nGlobalLimitExec (limit = 10) // Take the first 10 rows globally\r\n    |--LocalLimitExec (limit = 10) // Take the first 10 rows locally\r\n```\r\nThis operator reduce massive shuffle and has good performance.\r\nSometimes, the logic plan transformed to the physical plan as:\r\n```\r\nCollectLimitExec (limit = 10) // Take the first 10 rows globally\r\n```\r\nIf the SQL contains order by, such as `SELECT * FROM a order by c limit 10;`.\r\nThis SQL will be transformed to the physical plan as below:\r\n```\r\nTakeOrderedAndProjectExec (limit = 10) // Take the first 10 rows after sort globally\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on this situation, this PR produces the following operations. For example:\r\n`SELECT * FROM a limit 10 offset 10;` parsed to the logic plan as below:\r\n```\r\nGlobalLimit (limit = 10, offset = 10)\r\n    |--LocalLimit (limit = 10, offset = 10)\r\n```\r\nand then the physical plan as below:\r\n```\r\nGlobalLimitExec (limit = 10, offset = 10) // Skip the first 10 rows and take the next 10 rows globally\r\n    |--LocalLimitExec (limit = 10, offset = 10) // Take the first 20(limit + offset) rows locally\r\n```\r\nSometimes, the logic plan transformed to the physical plan as:\r\n```\r\nCollectLimitExec (limit = 10, offset = 10) // Skip the first 10 rows and take the next 10 rows globally\r\n```\r\nIf the SQL contains order by, such as `SELECT * FROM a order by c limit 10 offset 10;`.\r\nThis SQL will be transformed to the physical plan as below:\r\n```\r\nTakeOrderedAndProjectExec (limit = 10, offset 10) // Skip the first 10 rows and take the next 10 rows after sort globally\r\n```\r\n**3**.In addition to the above, there is a special case that is only offset but no limit. For example:\r\n`SELECT * FROM a offset 10;` parsed to the logic plan as below:\r\n```\r\nGlobalLimit (limit = -1, offset = 10) // -1 means invalid\r\n    |--LocalLimit (limit = -1, offset = 10) // -1 means invalid\r\n```\r\nIf offset is very large, will generate a lot of overhead. So I add a configuration item `spark.sql.forceUsingOffsetWithoutLimit` to force running query when user knows the offset is small enough. The default value of `spark.sql.forceUsingOffsetWithoutLimit` is false.\r\n\r\nNote: The origin PR to support this feature is https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25416.\r\nBecause the origin PR too old, there exists massive conflict which is hard to resolve.

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSpark support constraint propagation which will infer IsNotNull for some scene, like `where c = 1`. And `In`, `InSet`, `InSubQuery` also can use this feature. \r\n\r\nHere is some result that `In` executed.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// null\r\nnull in (1, 2)\r\n\r\n// null\r\n1 in (1, null)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAdd filter.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate table t (c string);\r\nexplain extended select c from t where c in ('1', '2');\r\n\r\n// before\r\nFilter c#8 IN (1,2)\r\n+- Relation[c#8] parquet\r\n\r\n// after\r\nFilter (isnotnull(c#162) AND c#162 IN (1,2))\r\n+- Relation[c#162] parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdd

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nForcing partition evaluation in `callsite` thread before sending `org.apache.spark.scheduler.JobSubmitted` event to `org.apache.spark.scheduler.DAGScheduler#eventProcessLoop` can help in mitigation against job submission event blocking the `DAGScheduler` thread\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`DAGScheduler` becomes a bottleneck in cluster when multiple `JobSubmitted` events has to be processed as `DAGSchedulerEventProcessLoop` is single threaded and it will block other tasks in queue like `TaskCompletion`.\r\nThe `JobSubmitted` event is time consuming depending on the nature of the job (Example: calculating parent stage dependencies, shuffle dependencies, partitions) and thus it blocks all the events to be processed.\r\n\r\nSimilarly in my cluster some jobs partition calculation is time consuming (Similar to stack at SPARK-2647) hence it slows down the spark `DAGSchedulerEventProcessLoop` which results in user jobs to slowdown, even if its tasks are finished within seconds, as `TaskCompletion` Events are processed at a slower rate due to blockage.\r\n\r\nRefer: http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/Spark-Scheduler-Spark-DAGScheduler-scheduling-performance-hindered-on-JobSubmitted-Event-td23562.html\r\n\r\nI see multiple JIRA referring to this behavior\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-2647\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-4961\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UT to reproduce and evaluate fix.","created_at":"2020-01-16T09:31:53Z","updated_at":"2020-05-30T00:20:48Z","closed_at":"2020-05-30T00:20:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4397bad9fe2783a7187912a4519dc02073aaa2a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406606875,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA2ODc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SCHEDULER","name":"SCHEDULER","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27234/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27234/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27234/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8e8ed6334dc616349d4017e4be550d73446a5e3e","head":{"label":"ajithme:dagsche","ref":"dagsche","sha":"8e8ed6334dc616349d4017e4be550d73446a5e3e","user":{"login":"ajithme","id":22072336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDcyMzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22072336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme","html_url":"https://github.com/ajithme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":124182301,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjQxODIzMDE=","name":"spark","full_name":"ajithme/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ajithme","id":22072336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDcyMzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22072336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme","html_url":"https://github.com/ajithme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajithme/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ajithme/spark","description":"Mirror

For example, a query below with empty input has a different answer between Spark and PostgreSQL:\r\n```\r\npostgres=# create table gstest_empty (a integer, b integer, v integer);\r\nCREATE TABLE\r\npostgres=# select a, b, sum(v), count(*) from gstest_empty group by grouping sets ((a,b),());\r\n a | b | sum | count \r\n---+---+-----+-------\r\n   |   |     |     0\r\n(1 row)\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"\"\"select a, b, sum(v), count(*) from gstest_empty group by grouping sets ((a,b),())\"\"\").show\r\n+---+---+------+--------+\r\n|  a|  b|sum(v)|count(1)|\r\n+---+---+------+--------+\r\n+---+---+------+--------+\r\n```\r\nIn the case, we should follow the PostgreSQL answer. To fix this, this PR added a new optimizer rule to rewrite a resolved logical plan as an union query of aggregates with/without keys as follows;\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"\"\"select a, b, sum(v), count(*) from gstest_empty group by grouping sets ((a,b),())\"\"\").explain(true)\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\na: int, b: int, sum(v): bigint, count(1): bigint\r\nAggregate [a#10, b#11, spark_grouping_id#7], [a#10, b#11, sum(cast(v#3 as bigint)) AS sum(v)#5L, count(1) AS count(1)#6L]\r\n+- Expand [List(a#1, b#2, v#3, a#8, b#9, 0), List(a#1, b#2, v#3, null, null, 3)], [a#1, b#2, v#3, a#10, b#11, spark_grouping_id#7]\r\n   +- Project [a#1, b#2, v#3, a#1 AS a#8, b#2 AS b#9]\r\n      +- SubqueryAlias `default`.`gstest_empty`\r\n         +- Relation[a#1,b#2,v#3] parquet\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nUnion\r\n:- Aggregate [a#10, b#11, spark_grouping_id#7], [a#10, b#11, sum(cast(v#3 as bigint)) AS sum(v)#5L, count(1) AS count(1)#6L]\r\n:  +- Expand [List(v#3, a#1, b#2, 0)], [v#3, a#10, b#11, spark_grouping_id#7]\r\n:     +- Project [v#3, a#1, b#2]\r\n:        +- Relation[a#1,b#2,v#3] parquet\r\n+- Aggregate [null AS a#10, null AS b#11, sum(cast(v#3 as bigint)) AS sum(v)#5L, count(1) AS count(1)#6L]\r\n   +- Project [v#3]\r\n      +- Relation[a#1,b#2,v#3] parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\nBehaviours of the other database-like systems:\r\n```\r\n// Presto\r\npresto:db> select a, b, sum(v), count(*) from gstest_empty group by grouping sets ((a,b),());\r\n  a   |  b   | _col2 | _col3 \r\n------+------+-------+-------\r\n NULL | NULL | NULL  |     0 \r\n(1 row)\r\n\r\n// MySQL does not have GROUPING SETS, so uses ROLLUP instead\r\nmysql> select a, b, sum(v), count(*) from gstest_empty group by a, b with rollup;\r\nEmpty set (0.01 sec)\r\n\r\n// Oracle & MS SQL Server have the same output\r\n// https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27233#issuecomment-577950755\r\nSQL> select a, b, sum(v), count(*) from gstest_empty group by grouping sets ((a,b),());\r\nno rows selected\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: This pr also updates the existing test in `OptimizeMetadataOnlyQuerySuite`; it has [the rollup query](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27233/files#diff-7d340edd739a1f59d51d5228113fd9edL120) and this PR transforms it into a `union(aggregate with keys, aggregate without keys)` form. The test checks that no metadata-only query happens there, but the `aggregate without keys` side can be optimized by the `OptimizeMetadataOnlyQuery` rule then `testNotMetadataOnly()` fails. To avoid this case, this PR replaces the rollup query with a grouping set one.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nHiveTableScanExec does not prune partitions again after SessionCatalog.listPartitionsByFilter called.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn HiveTableScanExec, it will push down to hive metastore for partition pruning if spark.sql.hive.metastorePartitionPruning is true, and then it will prune the returned partitions again using partition filters, because some predicates, eg. \"b like 'xyz'\", are not supported in hive metastore. But now this problem is already fixed in HiveExternalCatalog.listPartitionsByFilter, the HiveExternalCatalog.listPartitionsByFilter can return exactly what we want now. So it is not necessary any more to double prune in HiveTableScanExec.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, when speculative tasks fail/get killed, they are still considered as pending and count towards the calculation of number of needed executors. To be more accurate: `stageAttemptToNumSpeculativeTasks(stageAttempt)` is incremented on onSpeculativeTaskSubmitted, but never decremented.  `stageAttemptToNumSpeculativeTasks -= stageAttempt` is performed on stage completion. **This means Spark is marking ended speculative tasks as pending, which leads to Spark to hold more executors that it actually needs!**\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue by updating `stageAttemptToSpeculativeTaskIndices` and  `stageAttemptToNumSpeculativeTasks` on speculative tasks completion.  This PR also addresses some other minor issues: scheduler behavior after receiving an intentionally killed task event; try to address [SPARK-28403](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28403).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis has caused resource wastage in our production with speculation enabled. With aggressive speculation, we found data skewed jobs can hold hundreds of idle executors with less than 10 tasks running.\r\n\r\nAn easy repro of the issue (`--conf spark.speculation=true --conf spark.executor.cores=4 --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors=1000` in cluster mode):\r\n```\r\nval n = 4000\r\nval someRDD = sc.parallelize(1 to n, n)\r\nsomeRDD.mapPartitionsWithIndex( (index: Int, it: Iterator[Int]) => {\r\nif (index < 300 && index >= 150) {\r\n    Thread.sleep(index * 1000) // Fake running tasks\r\n} else if (index == 300) {\r\n    Thread.sleep(1000 * 1000) // Fake long running tasks\r\n}\r\nit.toList.map(x => index + \", \" + x).iterator\r\n}).collect\r\n```\r\nYou will see when running the last task, we would be hold 38 executors (see below), which is exactly (152 + 3) / 4 = 38.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9404831/72469112-9a7fac00-3793-11ea-8f50-74d0ab7325a4.png)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to use non-deprecated constructor of `ExpressionInfo` in `SparkSessionExtensionSuite`, and pass valid strings as `examples`, `note`, `since` and `deprecated` parameters.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUsing another constructor allows to eliminate the following deprecation warnings while compiling Spark:\r\n```\r\nWarning:(335, 5) constructor ExpressionInfo in class ExpressionInfo is deprecated: see corresponding Javadoc for more information.\r\n    new ExpressionInfo(\"noClass\", \"myDb\", \"myFunction\", \"usage\", \"extended usage\"),\r\nWarning:(732, 5) constructor ExpressionInfo in class ExpressionInfo is deprecated: see corresponding Javadoc for more information.\r\n    new ExpressionInfo(\"noClass\", \"myDb\", \"myFunction2\", \"usage\", \"extended usage\"),\r\nWarning:(751, 5) constructor ExpressionInfo in class ExpressionInfo is deprecated: see corresponding Javadoc for more information.\r\n    new ExpressionInfo(\"noClass\", \"myDb\", \"myFunction2\", \"usage\", \"extended usage\"),\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy compiling and running `SparkSessionExtensionSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-15T14:18:44Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:42:47Z","closed_at":"2020-01-16T04:36:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5c570c71c16571036d8a8721c3c2e44096043e29","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27221/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27221/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27221/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d6cfa93f0c61016b148a0f833c3b8ed4cefbf82a","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:eliminate-expr-info-warnings","ref":"eliminate-expr-info-warnings","sha":"d6cfa93f0c61016b148a0f833c3b8ed4cefbf82a","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor decimal values between -1.0 and 1.0, it should has same precision and scale in `Decimal`, in order to make it be consistent with `DecimalType`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, for values between -1.0 and 1.0, precision and scale is inconsistent between `Decimal` and `DecimalType`. For example, for numbers like 0.3, it will have (precision, scale) as (2, 1) in `Decimal`, but (1, 1) in `DecimalType`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> Literal(new BigDecimal(\"0.3\")).dataType.asInstanceOf[DecimalType].precision\r\nres3: Int = 1\r\n\r\nscala> Literal(new BigDecimal(\"0.3\")).value.asInstanceOf[Decimal].precision\r\nres4: Int = 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWe should make `Decimal` be consistent with `DecimalType`. And, here, we change it to only count precision digits after dot for values between -1.0 and 1.0 as other DBMS does, like hive:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhive> create table testrel as select 0.3;\r\nhive> describe testrel;\r\nOK\r\n_c0                 \tdecimal(1,1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could bring larger scale for values between -1.0 and 1.0.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdated existed

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIf application is started with JavaMainAppResource, no python environment, such as PYSPARK_MAJOR_PYTHON_VERSION and PYSPARK_EXECUTOR_MEMORY, won't be available in Executor Pods. It make it not easy to work with Livy. In apache Livy, the program is first started with JavaMainAppResource, and then start the Python worker. At this time, the program needs to be able to pass Python environment variables.\r\n\r\nIn spark on yarn, we support this through spark.yarn.isPython. In k8s, we should also support this.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo support Livy on spark with k8s, we need this config.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new unit tests and run all unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWIP \r\nAdded a syntax for `SHOW TABLES EXTENDED` which can output a additional column compared to `SHOW TABLES` which prints the table type with possible values `MANAGED,EXTERNAL,VIEW`\r\nAlso to reduce complexity, this PR breaks `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.command.ShowTablesCommand` which was responsible for `SHOW TABLES` and `SHOW TABLE` command into separate classes\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIntention is to support show tables with a additional column 'type' where type can be `MANAGED,EXTERNAL,VIEW` using which user can query only tables of required types, like listing only views or only external tables (using a `where` clause over `type` column).\r\n\r\nUsecase example:\r\nCurrently its not possible to list all the VIEWS, but other technologies like hive support it using `SHOW VIEWS`, mysql supports it using a more complex query `SHOW FULL TABLES WHERE table_type = 'VIEW;`\r\n\r\nDecide to take mysql approach as it provides more flexibility for querying.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. New option `EXTENDED` for `SHOW TABLES` command\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n\r\nTODO: \r\n1. Add UTs\r\n2. `where` clause support\r\n3.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRefine FileScan.estimateStatistics to take partitionFilters into account.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, FileScan.estimateStatistics does not take partitionFilters into account, which may lead to bigger sizeInBytes. It should be reasonable to change it to involve partitionFilters when estimating the statistics.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

**What changes were proposed in this pull request?**\r\n Fix task status inconsistent in `executorLost` which caused by `markPartitionCompleted`\r\n\r\n### **Why are the changes needed?**\r\nThe inconsistent will cause app hung up.\r\nThe bugs occurs in the corer case as follows:\r\n1. The stage occurs during stage retry, scheduler will resubmit a new stage with unfinished tasks.\r\n2. Those unfinished tasks in origin stage finished and the same task on the new retry stage hasn't finished, it will mark the task partition on the current retry stage as succesuful in TSM `successful` array variable. \r\n3. The executor crashed when it is running tasks which have succeeded by origin stage, it cause TSM run `executorLost` to rescheduler the task on the executor, and it will change the partition's running status in `copiesRunning` twice to -1.\r\n4. 'dequeueTaskFromList' will use `copiesRunning` equal 0 as reschedule basis when rescheduler tasks, and now it is -1, can't to reschedule, and the app will hung forever.\r\n\r\n### **Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?**\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### **How was this patch tested?**","created_at":"2020-01-15T06:02:07Z","updated_at":"2020-01-16T03:33:07Z","closed_at":"2020-01-16T03:33:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3793cc71585858ee6328d9d2825c38e33165fc1c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27211/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27211/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27211/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/278ade70671c73a9125f190061697788f533bdc1","head":{"label":"seayoun:branch-2.4","ref":"branch-2.4","sha":"278ade70671c73a9125f190061697788f533bdc1","user":{"login":"seayoun","id":45163307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTYzMzA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45163307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun","html_url":"https://github.com/seayoun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":228821056,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjg4MjEwNTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"seayoun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"seayoun","id":45163307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTYzMzA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45163307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun","html_url":"https://github.com/seayoun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seayoun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/seayoun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch addresses missing metric, the number of output rows for streaming aggregation with append mode.

Also manually tested with below query:\r\n\r\n> query\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport spark.implicits._\r\n\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.shuffle.partitions\", \"5\")\r\n\r\nval df = spark.readStream\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch addresses remaining functionality on event log compaction: integrate compaction into FsHistoryProvider.\r\n\r\nThis patch is next task of SPARK-30479 (#27164), please refer the description of PR #27085 to see overall rationalization of this patch.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOne of major goal of SPARK-28594 is to prevent the event logs to become too huge, and SPARK-29779 achieves the goal. We've got another approach in prior, but the old approach required models in both KVStore and live entities to guarantee compatibility, while they're not designed to do so.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[Delay scheduling](http://elmeleegy.com/khaled/papers/delay_scheduling.pdf) is an optimization that sacrifices fairness for data locality in order to improve cluster and workload throughput.\r\n\r\nOne useful definition of \"delay\" here is how much time has passed since the TaskSet was using its fair share of resources.\r\n\r\nHowever it is impractical to calculate this delay, as it would require running simulations assuming no delay scheduling. Tasks would be run in different orders with different run times.\r\n\r\nCurrently the heuristic used to estimate this delay is the time since a task was last launched for a TaskSet. The problem is that it essentially does not account for resource utilization, potentially leaving the cluster heavily underutilized.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the heuristic in an attempt to move closer to the useful definition of delay above.\r\nThe newly proposed delay is the time since a TasksSet last launched a task **and** did not reject any resources due to delay scheduling when offered its \"fair share\".\r\n\r\nSee the last comments of #26696 for more discussion.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\ncluster can become heavily underutilized as described in [SPARK-18886](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18886?jql=project%20%3D%20SPARK%20AND%20text%20~%20delay)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange ```DecisionTreeClassifier``` to ```FMClassifier``` in ```OneVsRest``` setWeightCol test \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn ```OneVsRest```, if the classifier doesn't support instance weight, ```OneVsRest``` weightCol will be ignored, so unit test has tested one classifier(```LogisticRegression```) that support instance weight, and one classifier (```DecisionTreeClassifier```) that doesn't support instance weight. Since ```DecisionTreeClassifier``` now supports instance weight, we need to change it to the classifier that doesn't have weight support. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAn app terminated abnormal sometimes may cause shuffe service memory leak. In one of our production cases, the app failed for Stage cancelled as SparkContext has already shut down. the strange is there are still requests for fetch shuffle data and cause error in server side as below:\r\n```\r\n2019-12-08 22:23:33,375 ERROR server.TransportRequestHandler (TransportRequestHandler.java:processFetchRequest(132)) - Error opening block StreamChunkId{streamId=1902064894814, chunkIndex=0} for request from /10.221.115.175:38582\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Executor is not registered (appId=application_1574499669561_954327, execId=4514)\r\n```\r\nthe client sie also show corresponding log like this:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.shuffle.FetchFailedException: Failure while fetching StreamChunkId{streamId=1902064894814, chunkIndex=0}: java.lang.RuntimeException: Executor is not registered (appId=application_1574499669561_954327, execId=4514)\r\n```\r\nin some cases, the request for `OpenBlocks` or `FetchShuffleBlocks` is still on the fly. In the code `ExternalBlockHandler#handleMessage`, it will register a `StreamState` to `OneForOneStreamManager#streams`, then reply an success response to client unconditionally , the client receive the response and then fire `ChunkFetchRequest` to fetch chunk, but at this time, the app has got event `APPLICATION_STOP` and executed `ExternalShuffleService#applicationRemoved` method to clean the app's `ExecutorShuffleInfo`, this made `Executor is not registered` error happended. even though when the client channel is closing, the `TransportRequestHandler#channelInactive` was called to clean the StreamState with relate channel, but when cleanning the `StreamState buffter`, it also lookup `ManagedBuffer` with` appId` and `execId` info which have been cleaned in executors object. we can also find the log:  `StreamManager connectionTerminated() callback failed` in NM's log file.\r\n\r\nso, when an `OpenBlocks` request come, we should lookup `ExternalShuffleBlockResolver#executors` , if the realted app is exited, we should not registering a `StreamState` then just close the client and reply a faild response. \r\nIn addition, when an app get `APPLICATION_STOP` to call `applicationRemoved`, we should clean the the related `streamState` before `ExecutorShuffleInfo` has been cleaned, this is what the PR changes and prevents the shuffle service memory leak.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe external shuffle service memory leak has a great impact on cluster with dynanic on and may cause NM crash.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadd

Actually, the map is converted from a `CaseInsensitiveStringMap`. Consequently, the check https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3663dbe541826949cecf5e1ea205fe35c163d147/external/avro/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/avro/AvroUtils.scala#L45 always return `false`,

And it will be eagerly executed after `executeCommand` called and the returned `DataFrame` will contain the output of the command(if any).\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis can be useful when user wants to execute some commands out of Spark. For example, executing custom DDL/DML command for JDBC, creating index for ElasticSearch, creating cores for Solr and so on(as @HyukjinKwon suggested).\r\n\r\nPreviously, user needs to use an option to achieve the goal, e.g. `spark.read.format(\"xxxSource\").option(\"command\", \"xxxCommand\").load()`, which is kind of cumbersome. With this change, it can be more convenient for user to achieve the same goal.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, new API from `SparkSession` and a new interface `ExternalCommandRunnableProvider`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a new test suite.","created_at":"2020-01-14T08:49:48Z","updated_at":"2020-01-31T23:15:03Z","closed_at":"2020-01-31T23:05:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"743806aad2b244fb84851410ffbc6b0c65e6415b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27199/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27199/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27199/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5ae5bd158e7aab6df3391961a481be0d26e2c60f","head":{"label":"Ngone51:dev-executeCommand","ref":"dev-executeCommand","sha":"5ae5bd158e7aab6df3391961a481be0d26e2c60f","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTableCatalog reserves some properties, e,g `provider`, `location` for internal usage. Some of them are static once create, some of them need specific syntax to modify. Instead of using `OPTIONS (k='v')` or TBLPROPERTIES (k='v'), if k is a reserved TableCatalog property, we should use its specific syntax to add/modify/delete it. e.g. `provider` is a reserved property, we should use the `USING` clause to specify it, and should not allow `ALTER TABLE ... UNSET TBLPROPERTIES('provider')` to delete it. Also, there are two paths for v1/v2 catalog tables to resolve these properties, e.g. the v1 session catalog tables will only use the `USING` clause to decide `provider` but v2 tables will also lookup OPTION/TBLPROPERTIES(although there is a bug prohibit it).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, 'path' is not reserved but holds special meaning for `LOCATION` and it is used in `CREATE/REPLACE TABLE`'s `OPTIONS` sub-clause. Now for the session catalog tables, the `path` is case-insensitive, but for the non-session catalog tables, it is case-sensitive, we should make it both case insensitive for disambiguation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nprevent reserved properties from being modified unexpectedly\r\nunify the property resolution for v1/v2.\r\nfix some bugs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nyes\r\n1 . `location` and `provider` (case sensitive) cannot be used in  `CREATE/REPLACE TABLE ... OPTIONS/TBLPROPETIES` and `ALTER TABLE ... SET TBLPROPERTIES (...)`, if legacy on, they will be ignored to let the command success without having side effects\r\n3. Once `path` in `CREATE/REPLACE TABLE ... OPTIONS`  is case insensitive for v1 but sensitive for v2, but now we change it case insensitive for both kinds of tables, then v2 tables will also fail if `LOCATION` and `OPTIONS('PaTh' ='abc')` are both specified or will pick `PaTh`'s value as table location if `LOCATION` is missing.\r\n4. Now we will detect if there are two different case `path` keys or more in  `CREATE/REPLACE TABLE ... OPTIONS`, once it is a kind of unexpected last-win policy for v1, and v2 is case sensitive.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nadd

are the changes needed?\r\nIntermediate RDDs in ML are cached with storageLevel=StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK.\r\nPeriodicRDDCheckpointer & PeriodicGraphCheckpointer now store RDD with storageLevel=StorageLevel.MEMORY_ONLY, it maybe nice to set the storageLevel of checkpointer.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nUse the new framework to resolve the DESCRIBE TABLE command.\r\n\r\nThe v1 DESCRIBE TABLE command supports both table and view. Checked with Hive and Presto, they don't have DESCRIBE TABLE syntax but only DESCRIBE, which supports both table and view:\r\n1. https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-DescribeTable/View/MaterializedView/Column\r\n2. https://prestodb.io/docs/current/sql/describe.html\r\n\r\nWe should make it clear that DESCRIBE support both table and view, by renaming the command to `DescribeRelation`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also tunes the framework a little bit to support the case that a command accepts both table and view.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a part of effort to make the relation lookup behavior consistent: SPARK-29900.\r\n\r\nNote that I make a separate PR here instead of #26921, as I need to update the framework to support a new use case: accept both table and view.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to increase the memory in `WorkerMemoryTest.test_memory_limit` in order to make the test pass with PyPy.\r\n\r\nThe test is currently failed only in PyPy as below in some PRs unexpectedly:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCurrent mem limits: 18446744073709551615 of max 18446744073709551615\r\n\r\nSetting mem limits to 1048576 of max 1048576\r\n\r\nRPython traceback:\r\n  File \"pypy_module_pypyjit_interp_jit.c\", line 289, in portal_5\r\n  File \"pypy_interpreter_pyopcode.c\", line 3468, in handle_bytecode__AccessDirect_None\r\n  File \"pypy_interpreter_pyopcode.c\", line 5558, in dispatch_bytecode__AccessDirect_None\r\nout of memory: couldn't allocate the next arena\r\nERROR\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems related to how PyPy allocates the memory and GC works PyPy-specifically. There seems nothing wrong in this configuration implementation itself in PySpark side.\r\n\r\nI roughly tested in higher PyPy versions on Ubuntu (PyPy v7.3.0) and this test seems passing fine so I suspect this might be an issue in old PyPy behaviours.\r\n\r\nThe change only increases the limit so it would not affect actual memory allocations. It just needs to test if the limit is properly set in worker sides. For clarification, the memory is unlimited in the machine if not set. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the tests pass and unblock other PRs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually and Jenkins should test it out.","created_at":"2020-01-13T07:30:41Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:16:49Z","closed_at":"2020-01-13T09:47:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ae1344a8ca4a2262fd4407a64da0747082fed2a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406590181,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTkwMTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYSPARK","name":"PYSPARK","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406606402,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA2NDAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/TESTS","name":"TESTS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27186/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27186/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27186/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9ee67614f7e613c383da6e521aa796326581ed21","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-30480","ref":"SPARK-30480","sha":"9ee67614f7e613c383da6e521aa796326581ed21","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use Pygment compatible format by Rouge. As of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26521, we use Rouge instead of Pygment wrapper in Ruby.\r\nRouge claims Pygment compatibility; and we should output as Pygment does.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nRouge::Formatters::HTMLPygments.new(formatter)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwraps codes with `<div class=\"highlight\"><pre>...` properly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo keep the documentation pretty and not broken.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nTheoretically, no.\r\n\r\nThis is rather a regression fix in documentation (that happens only by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26521 in master). See the malformed doc in preview - https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.0.0-preview2/sql-pyspark-pandas-with-arrow.html\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually built the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR removes a dangling test result, `JSONBenchmark-jdk11-results.txt`.\r\nThis causes a case-sensitive issue on Mac.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git

needed?\r\n\r\nPreviously, since the file name didn't match with `object JSONBenchmark`, it made a confusion when we ran the benchmark. So, 4e0e4e51c4 renamed `JSONBenchmark` to `JsonBenchmark`. However, at the same time frame, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26003 regenerated this file.\r\n\r\nRecently, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27078 regenerates the results with the correct file name, `JsonBenchmark-jdk11-results.txt`. So, we can remove the old one.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is a test result.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually check the following correctly generated files in the master. And, check this PR removes the dangling one.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/benchmarks/JsonBenchmark-results.txt\r\n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nEnable dependency audit files to tell the value of artifact id, version, and classifier of a dependency.\r\n\r\nFor example, `avro-mapred-1.8.2-hadoop2.jar` should be expanded to `avro-mapred/1.8.2/hadoop2/avro-mapred-1.8.2-hadoop2.jar` where `avro-mapred` is the artifact id, `1.8.2` is the version, and `haddop2` is the classifier.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDependency audit files are expected to be consumed by automated tests or downstream tools.\r\n\r\nHowever, current dependency audit files under `dev/deps` only show jar names. And there isn't a simple rule on how to parse the jar name to get the values of different fields. For example, `hadoop2` is the classifier of `avro-mapred-1.8.2-hadoop2.jar`, in contrast, `incubating` is the version of `htrace-core-3.1.0-incubating.jar`.\r\n\r\nReference: There is a good example of the downstream tool that would be enabled as @yhuai suggested, \r\n\r\n> Say we have a Spark application that depends on a third-party dependency `foo`, which pulls in `jackson` as a transient dependency. Unfortunately, `foo` depends on a different version of `jackson` than Spark. So, in the pom of this Spark application, we use the dependency management section to pin the version of `jackson`. By doing this, we are lifting `jackson` to the top-level dependency of my application and I want to have a way to keep tracking what Spark uses. What we can do is to cross-check my Spark application's classpath with what Spark uses. Then, with a test written in my code base, whenever my application bumps Spark version, this test will check what we define in the application and what Spark has, and then remind us to change our application's pom if needed. In my case, I am fine to directly access git to get these audit files.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCode changes are verified by generated dependency audit files naturally. Thus, there are no tests added.\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-12T17:14:49Z","updated_at":"2020-01-16T04:25:08Z","closed_at":"2020-01-16T04:25:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"808f55aff0bbfc231cbb4f2f4ccc40c9cac7cf0b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yhuai","id":2072857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzI4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2072857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai","html_url":"https://github.com/yhuai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587336,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PROJECT%20INFRA","name":"PROJECT

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nEnable dependency audit files to tell the value of artifact id, version, and classifier of a dependency.\r\n\r\nFor example, `avro-mapred-1.8.2-hadoop2.jar` should be expanded to `avro-mapred/1.8.2/hadoop2/avro-mapred-1.8.2-hadoop2.jar` where `avro-mapred` is the artifact id, `1.8.2` is the version, and `haddop2` is the classifier.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDependency audit files are expected to be consumed by automated tests or downstream tools.\r\n\r\nHowever, current dependency audit files under `dev/deps` only show jar names. And there isn't a simple rule on how to parse the jar name to get the values of different fields. For example, `hadoop2` is the classifier of `avro-mapred-1.8.2-hadoop2.jar`, in contrast, `incubating` is the version of `htrace-core-3.1.0-incubating.jar`.\r\n\r\nReference: There is a good example of the downstream tool that would be enabled as @yhuai suggested, \r\n\r\n> Say we have a Spark application that depends on a third-party dependency `foo`, which pulls in `jackson` as a transient dependency. Unfortunately, `foo` depends on a different version of `jackson` than Spark. So, in the pom of this Spark application, we use the dependency management section to pin the version of `jackson`. By doing this, we are lifting `jackson` to the top-level dependency of my application and I want to have a way to keep tracking what Spark uses. What we can do is to cross-check my Spark application's classpath with what Spark uses. Then, with a test written in my code base, whenever my application bumps Spark version, this test will check what we define in the application and what Spark has, and then remind us to change our application's pom if needed. In my case, I am fine to directly access git to get these audit files.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCode changes are verified by generated dependency audit files naturally. Thus, there are no tests added.\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-12T16:45:38Z","updated_at":"2020-01-30T02:54:07Z","closed_at":"2020-01-16T04:19:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6eec40a2cecd248498c8e40a0e1aff6e27043ab9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587336,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PROJECT%20INFRA","name":"PROJECT

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Remove the `@deprecated` annotation for `AvroOptions. ignoreExtension`\r\n- Output log warning if `avro.mapred.ignore.inputs.without.extension` is set to non-default value - `true`\r\n- Output log warning if avro option `ignoreExtension` is set to non-default value - `true`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. Currently, the compiler output deprecation warning only during compilation of Spark source code but not user apps because `AvroOptions.ignoreExtension` is not used by users directly. In this ways, users are not aware of deprecated Hadoop's conf and avro option.\r\n2. Elimination of unnecessary warnings highlights other warnings that can indicate about real problems. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy `AvroSuite`\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-11T12:20:56Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:42:35Z","closed_at":"2020-01-15T07:41:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"84e596dd70493c5bd56eb89527a76358385b4e72","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27174/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27174/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27174/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e25f1954d62972476e3bb4bdb58fa6fd8921d51c","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:avro-deprecation-warning","ref":"avro-deprecation-warning","sha":"e25f1954d62972476e3bb4bdb58fa6fd8921d51c","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to preserve existing permission/acls of paths when truncate table/partition.\r\nNote that this is backport of #26956 to branch-2.4.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Spark SQL truncates table, it deletes the paths of table/partitions, then re-create new ones. If permission/acls were set on the paths, the existing permission/acls will be deleted.\r\n\r\nWe should preserve the permission/acls if possible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. When truncate table/partition, Spark will keep permission/acls of paths.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test and manual test as shown in #26956.","created_at":"2020-01-11T01:36:15Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:38:09Z","closed_at":"2020-01-11T18:14:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a96619e38919e3f8261cc62cc436605c753bfba9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27173/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27173/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27173/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/454c71b05261fda60008146b3fc4bd4751fd7636","head":{"label":"viirya:truncate-table-permission-2.4","ref":"truncate-table-permission-2.4","sha":"454c71b05261fda60008146b3fc4bd4751fd7636","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFixed ByteType JDBCUtils to map to TinyInt at write read and ShortType on read  path. \r\nFixed Unit test cases where applicable and added new E2E test cases in to test table read/write  ByteType.\r\n\r\nRefer https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26301 for details. The fix was reverted as it mapped even the read path to a ByteType and that would have resulted in truncations for some database that support 0 to 255 for tinyint while spark byteType range is -127 to +127 only.\r\n\r\n#### Problems\r\n- In master in JDBCUtils.scala line number 547 and 551 have a problem where ByteType are set as Integers.\r\n```\r\ncase ByteType =>\r\n(stmt: PreparedStatement, row: Row, pos: Int) =>\r\nstmt.setInt(pos + 1, row.getByte(pos))\r\n```\r\n- Also at line JDBCUtils.scala 247 TinyInt is interpreted wrongly as IntergetType in getCatalystType()\r\n\r\n``` case java.sql.Types.TINYINT       => IntegerType ```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWith the current mapping of ByteType as \"Byte\" when writting a table from JDBC connector fails.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n(Write path) Uses would now be able to create tables when data frame has ByteType.\r\n(Read path) Spark dataframe that reads a table with a TINYINT will get mapped to ShortType rather than Integer\r\n \r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCorrected Unit test cases where applicable. \r\nAdded a test case in MsSqlServerIntegrationSuite.scala. Validated by manual as follows.\r\n```\r\n./build/mvn install -DskipTests\r\n./build/mvn test -Pdocker-integration-tests -pl :spark-docker-integration-tests_2.12\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-10T23:41:58Z","updated_at":"2020-06-06T00:21:44Z","closed_at":"2020-06-06T00:21:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"61c5b73e6db88b0089676d2a9ecc35011065caff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27172/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27172/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27172/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5ee7d5e7079e79222239484d05da903d1d2eade0","head":{"label":"shivsood:fix_ByteType_TinyInt_ShortType","ref":"fix_ByteType_TinyInt_ShortType","sha":"5ee7d5e7079e79222239484d05da903d1d2eade0","user":{"login":"shivsood","id":1579057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzkwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1579057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood","html_url":"https://github.com/shivsood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":192983938,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTI5ODM5Mzg=","name":"spark","full_name":"shivsood/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shivsood","id":1579057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzkwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1579057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood","html_url":"https://github.com/shivsood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shivsood/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to define a sub-class of `AppenderSkeleton` in `SparkFunSuite` and reuse it from other tests. The class stores incoming `LoggingEvent` in an array which is available to tests for future analysis of logged events.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis eliminates code duplication in tests.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites - `CSVSuite`, `OptimizerLoggingSuite`, `JoinHintSuite`, `CodeGenerationSuite` and `SQLConfSuite`.","created_at":"2020-01-10T08:55:36Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:42:36Z","closed_at":"2020-01-14T07:03:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b71028d7e21e89ea45f1e16b9ce4b8acbd51c8cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-kV0FS_LF2zvaRh_GhkV32Uqksm_Sq8SvnBBmRyxm30/edit#heading=h.h3ncjpk6ujqu), \"A couple of less-intuitive pandas UDF types\" (by @zero323) together.\r\n\r\nIn short,\r\n\r\n- Adds new way with type hints as an alternative and experimental way.\r\n    ```python\r\n    @pandas_udf(schema='...')\r\n    def func(c1: Series, c2: Series) -> DataFrame:\r\n        pass\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- Replace and/or add an alias for three types below from UDF, and make them as separate standalone APIs. So, `pandas_udf` is now consistent with regular `udf`s and other expressions.\r\n\r\n    `df.mapInPandas(udf)`  -replace-> `df.mapInPandas(f, schema)`\r\n    `df.groupby.apply(udf)`  -alias-> `df.groupby.applyInPandas(f, schema)`\r\n    `df.groupby.cogroup.apply(udf)`  -replace-> `df.groupby.cogroup.applyInPandas(f, schema)`\r\n\r\n    *`df.groupby.apply` was added from 2.3 while the other were added in the master only.\r\n\r\n- No deprecation for the existing ways for now.\r\n    ```python\r\n    @pandas_udf(schema='...', functionType=PandasUDFType.SCALAR)\r\n    def func(c1, c2):\r\n        pass\r\n    ```\r\nIf users are happy with this, I plan to deprecate the existing way and declare using type hints is not experimental anymore.\r\n\r\nOne design goal in this PR was that, avoid touching the internal (since we didn't deprecate the old ways for now), but supports type hints with a minimised changes only at the interface.\r\n\r\n- Once we deprecate or remove the old ways, I think it requires another refactoring for the internal in the future. At the very least, we should rename internal pandas evaluation types.\r\n- If users find this experimental type hints isn't quite helpful, we should simply revert the changes at the interface level.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order to address old design issues. Please see [the proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-kV0FS_LF2zvaRh_GhkV32Uqksm_Sq8SvnBBmRyxm30/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nFor behaviour changes, No.\r\n\r\nIt adds new ways to use pandas UDFs by using type hints. See below.\r\n\r\n**SCALAR**:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@pandas_udf(schema='...')\r\ndef func(c1: Series, c2: DataFrame) -> Series:\r\n    pass  # DataFrame represents a struct column\r\n```\r\n\r\n**SCALAR_ITER**:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@pandas_udf(schema='...')\r\ndef func(iter: Iterator[Tuple[Series, DataFrame, ...]]) -> Iterator[Series]:\r\n    pass  # Same as SCALAR but wrapped by Iterator\r\n```\r\n\r\n**GROUPED_AGG**:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@pandas_udf(schema='...')\r\ndef func(c1: Series, c2: DataFrame) -> int:\r\n    pass  # DataFrame represents a struct column\r\n```\r\n\r\n**GROUPED_MAP**:\r\n\r\nThis was added in Spark 2.3 as of SPARK-20396. As described above, it keeps the existing behaviour. Additionally, we now have a new alias `groupby.applyInPandas` for `groupby.apply`. See the example below:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef func(pdf):\r\n    return pdf\r\n\r\ndf.groupby(\"...\").applyInPandas(func, schema=df.schema)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**MAP_ITER**: this is not a pandas UDF anymore\r\n\r\nThis was added in Spark 3.0 as of SPARK-28198; and this PR replaces the usages. See the example below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef func(iter):\r\n    for df in iter:\r\n        yield df\r\n\r\ndf.mapInPandas(func, df.schema)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**COGROUPED_MAP**: this is not a pandas UDF anymore\r\n\r\nThis was added in Spark 3.0 as of SPARK-27463; and this PR replaces the usages. See the example below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef asof_join(left, right):\r\n    return pd.merge_asof(left, right, on=\"...\", by=\"...\")\r\n\r\n df1.groupby(\"...\").cogroup(df2.groupby(\"...\")).applyInPandas(asof_join, schema=\"...\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests added and tested against Python 2.7, 3.6 and 3.7.\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-10T07:55:10Z","updated_at":"2020-04-04T23:30:50Z","closed_at":"2020-01-22T06:33:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"20070d3bd3644d4ec2239933ab3b6cf7c437d337","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406590181,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTkwMTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYSPARK","name":"PYSPARK","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27165/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27165/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27165/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/76e09092f983782f0986c0c55c34165de62435bd","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:revisit-pandas","ref":"revisit-pandas","sha":"76e09092f983782f0986c0c55c34165de62435bd","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch addresses adding event filter to handle SQL related events. This patch is next task of SPARK-29779 (#27085), please refer the description of PR #27085 to see overall rationalization of this patch.\r\n\r\nBelow functionalities will be addressed in later parts:\r\n\r\n* integrate compaction into FsHistoryProvider\r\n* documentation about new configuration\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOne of major goal of SPARK-28594 is to prevent the event logs to become too huge, and SPARK-29779 achieves the goal. We've got another approach in prior, but the old approach required models in both KVStore and live entities to guarantee compatibility, while they're not designed to do so.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFollow up on [SPARK-30428](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27112) which added support for partition pruning in File source V2. \r\nThis PR implements the necessary changes in order to pass the `dataFilters` to the `listFiles`. This enables having `FileIndex` implementations which use the `dataFilters` for further pruning the file listing (see the discussion [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27112#discussion_r364757217)).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDatasources such as `csv` and `json` do not implement the `SupportsPushDownFilters` trait. In order to support data skipping uniformly for all file based data sources, one can override the `listFiles` method in a `FileIndex` implementation, which consults external metadata and prunes the list of files.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nModifying the unit tests for v2 file sources to verify the `dataFilters` are passed\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-09T23:07:18Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T18:22:08Z","closed_at":"2020-01-21T04:20:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a48fca5f3fbe2414d73f553568361d0fa463ba21","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27157/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27157/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27157/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d181e38a4440c7673b1c14ead96d9d9be2720ea3","head":{"label":"guykhazma:PushdataFiltersInFileListing","ref":"PushdataFiltersInFileListing","sha":"d181e38a4440c7673b1c14ead96d9d9be2720ea3","user":{"login":"guykhazma","id":33684427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjg0NDI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33684427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma","html_url":"https://github.com/guykhazma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":232538105,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzI1MzgxMDU=","name":"spark","full_name":"guykhazma/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guykhazma","id":33684427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjg0NDI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33684427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma","html_url":"https://github.com/guykhazma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guykhazma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guykhazma/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFirstly, much of this PR is a rebase of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22535, much thanks to @dbtsai for his work.\r\n\r\nSpark can now push down predicates on struct columns when reading Parquet and ORC tables.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere are significant performance gains to be had from pushing down predicates.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting UT were extended to cover the new functionality.\r\n\r\nSanity check

See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n- This PR revisits https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22309, and [SPARK-20384](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-20384) solving the original problem, but additionally will prevent backward-compat break on schema of top-level `AnyVal` value class.\r\n- Why previous break? We currently support top-level value classes just as any other case class; field of the underlying type is present in schema. This means any dataframe SQL filtering on this expects the field name to be present. The previous PR changes this schema and would result in breaking current usage. See test `\"schema for case class that is a value class\"`. This PR keeps the schema.\r\n- We actually currently support collection of value classes prior to this change, but not case class of nested value class. This means the schema of these classes shouldn't change to prevent breaking too. See the tests asserting schema before any changes in 0cdad3b\r\n- However, what we can change, without breaking, is schema of nested value class, which will fails due to the compile problem, and thus its schema now isn't actually valid. After the change, the schema of this nested value class is now flattened: \r\nc7aaae8\r\n- With this PR, there's flattening only for nested value class (new), but not for top-level and collection classes (existing behavior)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n- Currently, nested value class isn't supported. This is because when the generated code treats `anyVal` class in its unwrapped form, but we encode the type to be the wrapped case class. This results in compile of generated code\r\nFor example, \r\nFor a given `AnyVal` wrapper and its root-level class container\r\n```\r\ncase class IntWrapper(i: Int) extends AnyVal\r\ncase class ComplexValueClassContainer(c: IntWrapper)\r\n```\r\nThe problematic part of generated code:\r\n```\r\n    private InternalRow If_1(InternalRow i) {\r\n        boolean isNull_42 = i.isNullAt(0);\r\n        // 1) ******** The root-level case class we care\r\n        org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ComplexValueClassContainer value_46 = isNull_42 ?\r\n            null : ((org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ComplexValueClassContainer) i.get(0, null));\r\n        if (isNull_42) {\r\n            throw new NullPointerException(((java.lang.String) references[5] /* errMsg */ ));\r\n        }\r\n        boolean isNull_39 = true;\r\n        // 2) ******** We specify its member to be unwrapped case class extending `AnyVal`\r\n        org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.IntWrapper value_43 = null;\r\n        if (!false) {\r\n\r\n            isNull_39 = false;\r\n            if (!isNull_39) {\r\n                // 3) ******** ERROR: `c()` compiled however is of type `int` and thus we see error\r\n                value_43 = value_46.c();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nWe get this errror: Assignment conversion not possible from type \"int\" to type \"org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.IntWrapper\"\r\n```\r\njava.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: org.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompileException: \r\nFile 'generated.java', Line 159, Column 1: failed to compile: org.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompileException: File 'generated.java', Line 159, Column 1: Assignment conversion not possible from type \"int\" to type \"org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.IntWrapper\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n- Yes, this will fix the bug.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n- This PR ports all the tests from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22309 and added a few more.\r\n\r\ncc @mt40 please let me know

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor StringType and IntegerType, such as Byte/Short/Int/Long, their common type should be DoubleType.\r\nOther wise, the result may corrupted.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nWhen we comparing a String Type and IntegerType:\r\n'2147483648'(StringType, which exceed Int.MaxValue) > 0(IntegerType).\r\n\r\nNow the result of findCommonTypeForBinaryComparison(StringType, IntegerType) is IntegerType.\r\n\r\nBut the value of string may exceed Int.MaxValue, then the result is corruputed.\r\nIn this PR, for StringType and IntegerType, return DoubleType as their common type for binary comparison.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nResult may be corrupted.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark will not cleanup cached tables in tempViews produced by sql like following\r\n`CACHE TABLE table1 as SELECT ....`\r\nThere are risks that the `uncache table` not called due to session closed unexpectedly, or user closed manually. Then these temp views will lost, and we can not visit them in other session, but the cached plan still exists in the `CacheManager`.\r\nMoreover, the leaks may cause the failure of the subsequent query.\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException: File does not exist: /userxxx/xxx/dt=20200107/data__db60e76d_91b8_42f3_909d_5c68692ecdd4\r\nIt is possible the underlying files have been updated. You can explicitly invalidate the cache in Spark by running 'REFRESH TABLE tableName' command in SQL or by recreating the Dataset/DataFrame involved.\r\n```\r\nThis PR will fix it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR will fix the above issues by uncache cached temp tables when closing session.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-09T11:21:39Z","updated_at":"2020-01-21T04:55:31Z","closed_at":"2020-01-20T09:23:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aae3c43fc392ef7de0bec7242cdeffee582e2cb9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27149/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27149/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27149/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fa96d2f9f75b1f4cd19432037dd1fcdd32003f04","head":{"label":"liupc:SPARK-30470","ref":"SPARK-30470","sha":"fa96d2f9f75b1f4cd19432037dd1fcdd32003f04","user":{"login":"liupc","id":6747355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDczNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6747355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc","html_url":"https://github.com/liupc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":75380071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NTM4MDA3MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liupc/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liupc","id":6747355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDczNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6747355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc","html_url":"https://github.com/liupc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liupc/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n SizeInBytesOnlyStatsPlanVisitor.visitProject exclude partition columns when calculating sizeInBytes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen getting the statistics of a Project logical plan, if CBO not enabled, Spark will call SizeInBytesOnlyStatsPlanVisitor.visitUnaryNode to calculate the size in bytes, which will compute the ratio of the row size of the project plan and its child plan.\r\nAnd the row size is computed based on the output attributes (columns). Currently, SizeInBytesOnlyStatsPlanVisitor.visitUnaryNode involve partition columns of hive table as well, which is not reasonable, because partition columns actually does not account for sizeInBytes.\r\nThis may make the sizeInBytes not accurate. This PR update to exclude partition columns in SizeInBytesOnlyStatsPlanVisitor.visitProject\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently data columns are displayed in one line for show create table command, when the table has many columns (to make things even worse, columns may have long names or comments), the displayed result is really hard to read.\r\n\r\nTo improve readability, we print each column in a separate line. Note that other systems like Hive/MySQL also display in this way.\r\n\r\nAlso, for data columns, table properties and options, we put the right parenthesis to the end of the last column/property/option, instead of occupying a separate line.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nfor better readability\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nbefore
