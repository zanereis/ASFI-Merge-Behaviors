exclude patterns could exclude too much code, as\nreported in <code>issue 1779</code>_.  This is now fixed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Changed: previously, coverage.py would consider a module docstring to be an\nexecutable statement if it appeared after line 1 in the file, but not\nexecutable if it was the first line.  Now module docstrings are never counted\nas executable statements.  This can change coverage.py's count of the number\nof statements in a file, which can slightly change the coverage percentage\nreported.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the HTML report, the filter term and &quot;hide covered&quot; checkbox settings are\nremembered between viewings, thanks to <code>Daniel Diniz &lt;pull 1776_&gt;</code>_.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Python 3.13.0b1 is supported.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: parsing error handling is improved to ensure bizarre source files are\nhandled gracefully, and to unblock oss-fuzz fuzzing, thanks to <code>Liam DeVoe &lt;pull 1788_&gt;</code><em>.

href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/releases\">pytest-asyncio's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>pytest-asyncio 0.23.7</h2>\n<h1>0.23.7 (2024-05-19)</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Silence deprecation warnings about unclosed event loops that occurred with certain CPython patch releases <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/pull/817\">#817</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Known issues</h2>\n<p>As of v0.23, pytest-asyncio attaches an asyncio event loop to each item of the test suite (i.e. session, packages, modules, classes, functions) and allows tests to be run in those loops when marked accordingly. Pytest-asyncio currently assumes that async fixture scope is correlated with the new event loop scope. This prevents fixtures from being evaluated independently from the event loop scope and breaks some existing test suites (see <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/issues/706\">#706</a>). For example, a test suite may require all fixtures and tests to run in the same event loop, but have async fixtures that are set up and torn down for each module. If you're affected by this issue, please continue using the v0.21 release, until it is resolved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/eb63d5ad0ca21041726ada3d5c00211d36418a9b\"><code>eb63d5a</code></a> docs: Prepared for release of v0.23.7.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/da04a7a645bdd46d0533c727e85cf2c0e13c7def\"><code>da04a7a</code></a> Build(deps): Bump exceptiongroup in /dependencies/default</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/00c667ad80571fc8e937f4422267b135f55ec6e6\"><code>00c667a</code></a> Build(deps): Bump pytest from 8.1.1 to 8.2.0 in /dependencies/default</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/3bd9cd885b5cc78ce4a73a03c878ac93e0a1840f\"><code>3bd9cd8</code></a> [docs] Add changelog entry.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/15544f0ee29152086b14e63cb040836f33b0b416\"><code>15544f0</code></a> Revert GitHub Actions and Tox changes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/6316b285c1ee8f6d300916e531ff1d320bec8d6b\"><code>6316b28</code></a> Deduplicate simplefilter snippet.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/3ffdfc5607a112a9a2cb933a6af044eaf47e0227\"><code>3ffdfc5</code></a> asyncio.run(port_afinalizer())</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/0107fd7ae7e42d399b5be9af6f3ee4427e16ea7d\"><code>0107fd7</code></a> Remove extra space.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/3bf700a80cb12354fbe0a9295be9fbd4317c8d8f\"><code>3bf700a</code></a> Fix GH Action mapping.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/d15dc31f7459810af824b5e9e903f914140ceb2c\"><code>d15dc31</code></a> Fix 3109/3108 typo.</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/compare/v0.23.6...v0.23.7\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=pytest-asyncio&package-manager=pip&previous-version=0.23.6&new-version=0.23.7)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

today's release, 33.2.0. These releases have begun adding Java 8+ APIs to <code>guava-android</code>. While we don't anticipate problems, we do anticipate that any unexpected problems could force a disruptive rollback. To minimize any disruption, we'd like to catch any such problems early.</p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=type%3Ddefect&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug_report.yaml\">let us know of any problems you encounter</a>.</p>\n<h3>Maven</h3>\n<pre lang=\"xml\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.guava&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;guava&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;33.2.0-jre&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;!-- or, for Android: --&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;33.2.0-android&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Jar files</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/guava/33.2.0-jre/guava-33.2.0-jre.jar\">33.2.0-jre.jar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/guava/33.2.0-android/guava-33.2.0-android.jar\">33.2.0-android.jar</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Guava requires <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UseGuavaInYourBuild#what-about-guavas-own-dependencies\">one runtime dependency</a>, which you can download here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/failureaccess/1.0.1/failureaccess-1.0.1.jar\">failureaccess-1.0.1.jar</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Javadoc</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://guava.dev/releases/33.2.0-jre/api/docs/\">33.2.0-jre</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://guava.dev/releases/33.2.0-android/api/docs/\">33.2.0-android</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>JDiff</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://guava.dev/releases/33.2.0-jre/api/diffs/\">33.2.0-jre vs. 33.1.0-jre</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://guava.dev/releases/33.2.0-android/api/diffs/\">33.2.0-android vs. 33.1.0-android</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://guava.dev/releases/33.2.0-android/api/androiddiffs/\">33.2.0-android vs. 33.2.0-jre</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changelog</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Dropped testing for Android versions before Lollipop (API Level 21).

(858caf425c)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Made our <code>Collector</code> APIs (e.g., <code>ImmutableList.toImmutableList()</code>) available in <code>guava-android</code>. More <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6567\">Java 8 APIs</a> will follow in future releases. (96fca0b747)\n<ul>\n<li>As always, streams are available to Android code only when that code <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring\">enables library desugaring</a> or targets a new enough API Level (<a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/stream/Stream\">24 (Nougat)</a> for many stream APIs). (But note that we test only with library desugaring, so we don't currently know if API Level 24 is high enough to use our <code>Collector</code> APIs unless you have also enabled library desugaring.) Guava users who <em>avoid</em> the <code>Collector</code> APIs do <em>not</em> need to meet this requirement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Fixed a potential <code>NullPointerException</code> in <code>ImmutableMap.Builder</code> on a rare code path. (70a98115d8)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Added <code>HttpHeaders</code> constants <code>Ad-Auction-Allowed</code>, <code>Permissions-Policy-Report-Only</code>, and <code>Sec-GPC</code>.

href=\"https://github.com/pypa/pyproject-hooks/blob/main/docs/changelog.rst\">pyproject-hooks's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Changelog</h1>\n<h2>v1.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add type annotations to the public API.</li>\n<li>More careful handling of the <code>backend-path</code> key from <code>pyproject.toml</code>.\nPrevious versions would load the backend and then check that it was loaded\nfrom the specified path; the new version only loads it from the specified path.\nThe <code>BackendInvalid</code> exception is now a synonym for :exc:<code>BackendUnavailable</code>,\nand code should move to using the latter name.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v1.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Rename package to <code>pyproject_hooks</code> (from <code>pep517</code>).</li>\n<li>Remove deprecated modules (<code>.build</code>, <code>.check</code> and <code>.envbuild</code>).\nUse the <code>build &lt;https://pypa-build.readthedocs.io/en/stable/&gt;</code>_ project\ninstead for this higher-level functionality of setting up a temporary build\nenvironment.</li>\n<li>Require Python 3.7 or above.</li>\n<li>Use <code>tomllib</code> from the standard library on Python 3.11. <code>pyproject_hooks</code>\nnow has no external dependencies when installed in Python 3.11.</li>\n<li>Avoid chaining exceptions when using the fallback implementation for\n:meth:<code>.prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel</code>.</li>\n<li>Fix propagating error message for :exc:<code>.BackendInvalid</code> errors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v0.13</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove support for end-of-life Pythons. Now requires Python3.6+.</li>\n<li>Remove support for <code>toml</code> package. Now requires <code>tomli</code>.</li>\n<li>Rely on preferred &quot;files&quot; API on Python 3.9 and later (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pypa/pyproject-hooks/issues/140\">#140</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v0.12</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add method for pip to check if build_editable hook is supported.\nThis is a private API for now.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v0.11.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix DeprecationWarning in tomli.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v0.11</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Support editable hooks (<code>PEP 660 &lt;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0660/&gt;</code>_).</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>8.2.0</h2>\n<h1>pytest 8.2.0 (2024-04-27)</h1>\n<h2>Deprecations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12069\">#12069</a>: A deprecation warning is now raised when implementations of one of the following hooks request a deprecated <code>py.path.local</code> parameter instead of the <code>pathlib.Path</code> parameter which replaced it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>pytest_ignore_collect</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>collection_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_collect_file</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>file_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_pycollect_makemodule</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>path</code> parameter - use <code>module_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_report_header</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>startdir</code> parameter - use <code>start_path</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>pytest_report_collectionfinish</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;hook&quot;} - the <code>startdir</code> parameter - use <code>start_path</code> instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The replacement parameters are available since pytest 7.0.0.\nThe old parameters will be removed in pytest 9.0.0.</p>\n<p>See <code>legacy-path-hooks-deprecated</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for more details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11871\">#11871</a>: Added support for reading command line arguments from a file using the prefix character <code>@</code>, like e.g.: <code>pytest @tests.txt</code>.

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Mypy Release Notes</h1>\n<h2>Next release</h2>\n<h2>Mypy 1.10</h2>\n<p>We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.10 to the Python Package Index (<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/mypy/\">PyPI</a>). Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>python3 -m pip install -U mypy\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can read the full documentation for this release on <a href=\"http://mypy.readthedocs.io\">Read the Docs</a>.</p>\n<h4>Support TypeIs (PEP 742)</h4>\n<p>Mypy now supports <code>TypeIs</code> (<a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0742/\">PEP 742</a>), which allows\nfunctions to narrow the type of a value, similar to <code>isinstance()</code>. Unlike <code>TypeGuard</code>,\n<code>TypeIs</code> can narrow in both the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> branches of an if statement:</p>\n<pre lang=\"python\"><code>from typing_extensions import TypeIs\n<p>def is_str(s: object) -&gt; TypeIs[str]:\nreturn isinstance(s, str)</p>\n<p>def f(o: str | int) -&gt; None:\nif is_str(o):\n# Type of o is 'str'\n...\nelse:\n# Type of o is 'int'\n...\n</code></pre></p>\n<p><code>TypeIs</code> will be added to the <code>typing</code> module in Python 3.13, but it\ncan be used on earlier Python versions by importing it from\n<code>typing_extensions</code>.</p>\n<p>This feature was contributed by Jelle Zijlstra (PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/mypy/pull/16898\">16898</a>).</p>\n<h4>Support TypeVar Defaults (PEP 696)</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0696/\">PEP 696</a> adds support for type parameter defaults.\nExample:</p>\n<pre lang=\"python\"><code>from typing import Generic\nfrom typing_extensions import TypeVar\n<p>&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/releases\">com.google.errorprone:error_prone_annotations's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Error Prone 2.26.1</h2>\n<p>This release contains all of the changes in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.26.0\">2.26.0</a>, plus a bug fix to the module name of the annotations artifact <code>com.google.errorprone.annotations</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/commit/9d99ee76f2ca8568b69150f5df7fe845c8545d16\">https://github.com/google/error-prone/commit/9d99ee76f2ca8568b69150f5df7fe845c8545d16</a>)</p>\n<p>Starting in <code>2.26.x</code>, the 'annotations' artifact now includes a <code>module-info.java</code> for Java Platform Module System support, thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/sgammon\"><code>@​sgammon</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4311\">#4311</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Compatibility note:</strong></p>\n<p>Now that the annotations artifact explicit declares a module instead of relying on <code>Automatic-Module-Name</code>, JDK 17 and newer perform stricter module encapsulation checks. Modularized libraries depending on Error Prone annotations <code>2.26.x</code> and newer may see errors like:</p>\n<pre><code>error: package com.google.errorprone.annotations is not visible\nimport com.google.errorprone.annotations.CheckReturnValue;\n                            ^\n  (package com.google.errorprone.annotations is declared in module com.google.errorprone.annotations, but module ... does not read it)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The fix is to add <code>requires static</code> to the module declaration of modularized libraries that depend on Error Prone annotations:</p>\n<pre lang=\"diff\"><code> module your.module {\n...\n+  requires static com.google.errorprone.annotations;\n }\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<p>Full Changelog: <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.26.0...v2.26.1\">https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.26.0...v2.26.1</a></p>\n<h2>Error Prone 2.26.0</h2>\n<p><strong>Warning: This release contains a bug, please use <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.26.1\">2.26.1</a> or newer instead.</strong></p>\n<p>Changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 'annotations' artifact now includes a <code>module-info.java</code> for Java Platform Module System support, thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/sgammon\"><code>@​sgammon</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4311\">#4311</a>.</li>\n<li>Disabled checks passed to <code>-XepPatchChecks</code> are now ignored, instead of causing a crash.

fixes the issue mentioned in #1433.\r\n\r\nWhen writing multiple tags via ADS, the IndexOffset and tag specific data type sizes were incorrect; the IndexOffset should indicate how many tags are being written instead of how many bytes, and the individual tag write sizes were pointing to the length of the data type table entry instead of the data type size from that entry.

with <code>[run] relative_files=True</code>, a data file\ncould be created with absolute path names.  When combined with other relative\ndata files, it was random whether the absolute file names would be made\nrelative or not. If they weren't, then a file would be listed twice in\nreports, as detailed in <code>issue 1752</code>_.  This is now fixed: absolute file\nnames are always made relative when combining.  Thanks to Bruno Rodrigues dos\nSantos for support.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: the last case of a match/case statement had an incorrect message if the\nbranch was missed.  It said the pattern never matched, when actually the\nbranch is missed if the last case always matched.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: clicking a line number in the HTML report now positions more accurately.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: the <code>report:format</code> setting was defined as a boolean, but should be a\nstring.  Thanks, <code>Tanaydin Sirin &lt;pull 1754_&gt;</code>_.  It is also now documented\non the :ref:<code>configuration page &lt;config_report_format&gt;</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _issue 1752: <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1752\">nedbat/coveragepy#1752</a>\n.. _pull 1754: <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1754\">nedbat/coveragepy#1754</a></p>\n<p>.. _changes_7-4-3:</p>\n<h2>Version 7.4.3 — 2024-02-23</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: in some cases, coverage could fail with a RuntimeError: &quot;Set changed\nsize during iteration.&quot; This is now fixed, closing <code>issue 1733</code>_.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _issue 1733: <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1733\">nedbat/coveragepy#1733</a></p>\n<p>.. _changes_7-4-2:</p>\n<h2>Version 7.4.2 — 2024-02-20</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: setting <code>COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon</code> no longer errors on 3.11 and lower,\nthanks <code>Hugo van Kemenade &lt;pull 1747_&gt;</code>_.

[pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) from 8.0.0 to 8.1.1.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/releases\">pytest's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>8.1.1</h2>\n<h1>pytest 8.1.1 (2024-03-08)</h1>\n<p>::: {.note}\n::: {.title}\nNote\n:::</p>\n<p>This release is not a usual bug fix release -- it contains features and improvements, being a follow up\nto <code>8.1.0</code>, which has been yanked from PyPI.\n:::</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11475\">#11475</a>: Added the new <code>consider_namespace_packages</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;confval&quot;} configuration option, defaulting to <code>False</code>.</p>\n<p>If set to <code>True</code>, pytest will attempt to identify modules that are part of <a href=\"https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages\">namespace packages</a> when importing modules.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11653\">#11653</a>: Added the new <code>verbosity_test_cases</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;confval&quot;} configuration option for fine-grained control of test execution verbosity.\nSee <code>Fine-grained verbosity &lt;pytest.fine_grained_verbosity&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for more details.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10865\">#10865</a>: <code>pytest.warns</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;} now validates that <code>warnings.warn</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;} was called with a [str]{.title-ref} or a [Warning]{.title-ref}.\nCurrently in Python it is possible to use other types, however this causes an exception when <code>warnings.filterwarnings</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;} is used to filter those warnings (see [CPython <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/103577\">#103577</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/cpython/issues/103577\">python/cpython#103577</a>) for a discussion).\nWhile this can be considered a bug in CPython, we decided to put guards in pytest as the error message produced without this check in place is confusing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11311\">#11311</a>: When using <code>--override-ini</code> for paths in invocations without a configuration file defined, the current working directory is used\nas the relative directory.</p>\n<p>Previoulsy this would raise an <code>AssertionError</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;}.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11475\">#11475</a>: <code>--import-mode=importlib &lt;import-mode-importlib&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} now tries to import modules using the standard import mechanism (but still without changing :py<code>sys.path</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;data&quot;}), falling back to importing modules directly only if that fails.</p>\n<p>This means that installed packages will be imported under their canonical name if possible first, for example <code>app.core.models</code>, instead of having the module name always be derived from their path (for example <code>.env310.lib.site_packages.app.core.models</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11801\">#11801</a>: Added the <code>iter_parents() &lt;_pytest.nodes.Node.iter_parents&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;} helper method on nodes.\nIt is similar to <code>listchain &lt;_pytest.nodes.Node.listchain&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;func&quot;}, but goes from bottom to top, and returns an iterator, not a list.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11850\">#11850</a>: Added support for <code>sys.last_exc</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;data&quot;} for post-mortem debugging on Python&gt;=3.12.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11962\">#11962</a>: In case no other suitable candidates for configuration file are found, a <code>pyproject.toml</code> (even without a <code>[tool.pytest.ini_options]</code> table) will be considered as the configuration file and define the <code>rootdir</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a
