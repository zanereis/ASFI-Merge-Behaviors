Request for the addition of a Satori RTM processor bundle:\r\n\r\n**ConsumeSatoriRTM**\r\nConsumes a live data stream from Satori RTM based on a user specified Endpoint, Appkey, and Channel. Also supports the following features and configurations:\r\n- Connection to Satori private channels (using Role & Role Secret Key configurations for authentication)\r\n- Satori's Streamview filters, which allow you to provide SQL-like queries to select, transform, or aggregate messages from a subscribed channel\r\n- Batching of multiple messages into a single FlowFile, which will provide a new-line delimited list of messages in each output FlowFile (based on a 'minimum batch size' configuration)\r\n\r\nExample walkthrough on using the processor can be found here:\r\nhttps://community.hortonworks.com/articles/144322/stream-satori-open-data-feeds-with-apache-nifi.html\r\n\r\n**PublishSatoriRTM**\r\nPublishes incoming FlowFiles to Satori RTM, based on user specified Satori configurations for Endpoint, Appkey, Role, Role Secret Key, and Channel. Supports the use of a Message Demarcator to split the incoming flowfile as separate RTM messages, or if unspecified will send an entire flowfile content as a single RTM message.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHappy to make any changes based on review &

caused new Primary Node to not pull current Clustered State when File Location was set to Remote. Fixed bug that caused TailFile to occasionally become 'stuck' when the file it is tailing is renamed and a new file is created with the same name. Removed the 'Rolling Strategy' property from TailFile because it is not actually used in the processor anymore. Deleted MonitorMemoryTest because the unit test was testing the behavior of FlowController more than the behavior of the reporting task itself and in order to do so had a dependency in the pom.xml on nifi-framework-core, which means that it no longer compiles when FlowController is modified.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

some scenarios the updated ExecuteSQL returns no FlowFile, even when the SQL was executed without error. This is a bug I introduced in https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1471.\r\n\r\nIf you execute a stored procedure that returns only a row count, or if the row count is the first result and the ResultSet follows it, then no FlowFile will be generated. This is because `getMoreResults()` and `execute()` return false to indicate that the ResultSet does not exist OR that the statement returned a number and not a ResultSet. So if ResultSet's and numerical responses are inter mixed this will also result in missed result sets.\r\n\r\nSome JDBC drivers allow for multi-statement requests to be submitted using `Statement.execute`. In these cases you can have an INSERT statement followed by a SELECT statement. In this case no ResultSet would be returned either.\r\n\r\nPrior to NIFI-3432, executing any number of statements would result in a single ResultSet, which may or may not include data. I've seen examples of a DELETE followed by several INSERT statements and our JDBC driver (Teradata) would execute them and NiFi would return a single empty FlowFile.\r\n\r\nThis update corrects the logic. The new logic:\r\n- For every ResultSet, output a FlowFile\r\n- Skip non-ResultSet outputs\r\n- If we have no more results, there were no errors, there was no original inbound FlowFile, and no ResultSet's were found at all (statements were Insert/Update/Delete only), then output a blank FlowFile.\r\n\r\n@mattyb149 You reviewed https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1471 for me, not sure if you have the time to review this fix as well. I know in the past you weren't big on the idea of executing non SELECT statements from ExecuteSQL, but it's something I'm seeing in our environment since the JDBC driver allows it, and since we can do multi-statement requests.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

been trying to read UTF-8 BOM CSV files with occasional Chinese in them. I've been running into a lot of trouble with the strings being read as junk characters.\r\n\r\nThe strange thing is, though I added two unit tests, these tests pass without this code change in place in my environment (I know... not great tests). But with this code change in place CSV now works great on my actual server.\r\n\r\nAccording to the docs, if you don't explicitly specify UTF-8 then the read/write streams will use the environments default encoding. It feels likely that my default environment for my unit tests is UTF-8, but is something different when I run NiFi. Not exactly sure.\r\n\r\nWith this change in place, the code now matches the example code from Apache Commons CSV documentation on how to handle files with a BOM. The BOM was being handled already through the use of a BOMInputStream, but no encoding was being explicitly set. https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-csv/user-guide.html#Handling_Byte_Order_Marks\r\n\r\n**I've made the default value UTF-8, but users are free to pick any encoding.**\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
