Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `getDefaultBlockSize` and `openSeekable` APIs to `HoodieStorage` and implements these APIs in `HoodieHadoopStorage`.  The implementation follows the same logic of creating seekable input stream for log file reading, and `openSeekable` will be used by the log reading logic.\r\n\r\nA few util methods are moved from `FSUtils` and `HoodieLogFileReader` classes to `HadoopFSUtils`class.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSupports seekable input stream and log reading with `HoodieStorage`.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nClean up literal usage in Hudi CLI argument check:  \r\n\r\n- added min arguments count as an int field to SparkCommand enum, and now there is a single literal usage for each command (instead of 5 that was before);  \r\n- added args count validation methods to SparkCommand;  \r\n- extracted common logic of additional configs creation to `makeConfigs` method in SparkCommand;  \r\n- extracted common logic of getting propsFilePath to `getPropsFilePath` method in SparkCommand;\r\n- called args validation and configs/propsFilePath computations for all values before the `switch(cmd)`\r\n- fixed logging;\r\n- reused `ArchiveExecutorUtils.archive()` method for `archive` command execution.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-17T14:57:40Z","updated_at":"2024-04-18T02:14:32Z","closed_at":"2024-04-18T02:14:32Z","merged_at":"2024-04-18T02:14:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"4c04216d5cade10f9589e2c0d425109cc502ebcd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6605747796,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABibu2VA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:M","name":"size:M","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIndex lookup duration we emit as of now is buggy. We compute the duration before and after tag() call which is actually lazy. So, the actual lookup was not even triggered, but we compute the duration and emit the value. Within tag() calls, we do partitioners instantiation and few other minor things that runs in the driver and the index duration was referring to that. \r\n\r\nWe also confirmed from our production metrics. \r\n\r\nduration from stream sync for one batch of ingest : 34 mins. \r\ndelta commit duration: 32 mins\r\nindex look up duration (buggy): 3.6 mins\r\n\r\nSo, fixing it in this patch. We are introducing a metric named \"pre_write.lookup.duration\" which will refer to duration of starting of write to the completion of building workload profile. Just when we are building the workload profile is when the entire dag is triggered and hence we can't split it up further. \r\n\r\nAlso removed the previous buggy metrics. \r\n\r\nTesting: \r\nAlso tested manually. I injected 10 sec delay to bloom index check function (executor) and here are the duration from metrics. \r\n\r\nhudi_trips_cow.commit.duration\r\n             value = 13886\r\n\r\nhudi_trips_cow.pre_write.lookup.duration\r\n             value = 11411\r\n\r\nhudi_trips_cow.index.lookup.duration\r\n             value = 987\r\n \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nCorrect metric value for pre write duration. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIndex lookup duration we emit as of now is buggy. We compute the duration before and after tag() call which is actually lazy. So, the actual lookup was not even triggered, but we compute the duration and emit the value. Within tag() calls, we do partitioners instantiation and few other minor things that runs in the driver and the index duration was referring to that. \r\n\r\nWe also confirmed from our production metrics. \r\n\r\nduration from stream sync for one batch of ingest : 34 mins. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1426\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/onehouseinc/hudi-internal/assets/513218/dce9316f-9245-40b7-abd4-86a710db14f4\">\r\n\r\ndelta commit duration: 32 mins\r\n<img width=\"1270\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/onehouseinc/hudi-internal/assets/513218/74d007ed-78c1-48f0-95cb-5a6f796e4a0f\">\r\n\r\nindex look up duration (buggy): 3.6 mins\r\n<img width=\"1381\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/onehouseinc/hudi-internal/assets/513218/82f46131-86d3-49b1-ba6c-5edc8e1bc15c\">\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, fixing it in this patch. We are introducing a metric named \"pre_write.lookup.duration\" which will refer to duration of starting of write to the completion of building workload profile. Just when we are building the workload profile is when the entire dag is triggered and hence we can't split it up further. \r\n\r\nAlso removed the previous buggy metrics. \r\n\r\nTesting: \r\nAlso tested manually. I injected 10 sec delay to bloom index check function (executor) and here are the duration from metrics. \r\n\r\nhudi_trips_cow.commit.duration\r\n             value = 13886\r\n\r\nhudi_trips_cow.pre_write.lookup.duration\r\n             value = 11411\r\n\r\nhudi_trips_cow.index.lookup.duration\r\n             value = 987\r\n \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nCorrect metric value for pre write duration. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe read path for functional index leads to a NPE which causes file-pruning to be skipped entirely.

Check functional index definiton and if there is an index, then use that to skip files.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nCorrect data skipping with functional index.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low

Change Logs\r\n\r\nNOTE: This PR handles only AVRO code paths, there will be follow-up patch for RowWriter code paths as well. \r\n\r\nThere are two problems with BULK_INSERT and partitioners.  \r\n1. Passing user defined partitioner using `hoodie.bulkinsert.user.defined.partitioner.class` is not honoured in the StreamSync code path and the data is written in a non-sort mode and can lead to OOM errors because of too many open writeHandles. \r\n2. There is another problem with `RDDCustomColumnsSortPartitioner` where data is globally sorted but too many files are written because data is actually not pre-pending the partition keys in the sort columns. The unit test fails with this error for existing code.\r\n```\r\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: \r\nExpected :654\r\nActual   :3\r\n<Click to see difference> \r\n\r\n// Verify each partition has one base file because parallelism is 1.\r\nassertEquals(baseFiles.size(), partitions.size());\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/onehouseinc/hudi-internal/blob/master/hudi-client/hudi-spark-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/execution/bulkinsert/RDDCustomColumnsSortPartitioner.java#L60 \r\n```\r\n @Override\r\n  public JavaRDD<HoodieRecord<T>> repartitionRecords(JavaRDD<HoodieRecord<T>> records,\r\n                                                     int outputSparkPartitions) {\r\n    final String[] sortColumns = this.sortColumnNames;\r\n    final SerializableSchema schema = this.serializableSchema;\r\n    final boolean consistentLogicalTimestampEnabled = this.consistentLogicalTimestampEnabled;\r\n    return records.sortBy(\r\n        record -> {\r\n          Object[] columnValues = record.getColumnValues(schema.get(), sortColumns, consistentLogicalTimestampEnabled);\r\n          return FlatLists.ofComparableArray(columnValues);\r\n        },\r\n        true, outputSparkPartitions);\r\n  } \r\n```\r\n\r\nBut `_hoodie_partition_path` is returned as null here using record.getColumnValues, added the screenshots from debugger because these fields are actually added as part of `HoodieAvroParquetWriter`. \r\nhttps://github.com/onehouseinc/hudi-internal/blob/master/hudi-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/io/storage/HoodieAvroParquetWriter.java#L64 \r\n```\r\n  @Override\r\n  public void writeAvroWithMetadata(HoodieKey key, IndexedRecord avroRecord) throws IOException {\r\n    if (populateMetaFields) {\r\n      prepRecordWithMetadata(key, avroRecord, instantTime,\r\n          taskContextSupplier.getPartitionIdSupplier().get(), getWrittenRecordCount(), fileName);\r\n      super.write(avroRecord);\r\n      writeSupport.add(key.getRecordKey());\r\n    } else {\r\n      super.write(avroRecord);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  default void prepRecordWithMetadata(HoodieKey key, IndexedRecord avroRecord, String instantTime, Integer partitionId, long recordIndex, String fileName) {\r\n    String seqId = HoodieRecord.generateSequenceId(instantTime, partitionId, recordIndex);\r\n    HoodieAvroUtils.addHoodieKeyToRecord((GenericRecord) avroRecord, key.getRecordKey(), key.getPartitionPath(), fileName);\r\n    HoodieAvroUtils.addCommitMetadataToRecord((GenericRecord) avroRecord, instantTime, seqId);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n```\r\nAttaching the screenshots below where _hoodie_partition_path column is null. \r\n![image](https://github.com/onehouseinc/hudi-internal/assets/16958856/131fcf7c-7bc6-49db-aa82-d2871bf49a8f)\r\n

defined partitioners to ensure it sorts the data correctly.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nMedium.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [x] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the default cleaner behavior to avoid multiple cleaner plans, i.e., only scheduling a new cleaner plan if there is no inflight plan, by setting the default of `hoodie.clean.allow.multiple` to false.  The config is also deprecated and going to be removed after one release.  This is to avoid overlapping cleaner plans when MDT is enabled, and there is no need to schedule multiple inflight cleaner plans.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMakes cleaner behavior easier to maintain and understand.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nConfig docs will be updated during the release process.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Improve the efficiency of `getRelativePartitionPath` by reducing the number of operations on the path object that are required to get the final result\r\n- Reduce the number of times a partitionPath is computed by supplying a partition path argument where possible in the AbstractFileSystemView\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nReduces overhead of building FSViews with large numbers of files\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nPreviously in #10874, we use the DT earliest pending instant time as the MDT compaction time, it may conflict with the delta_commit when the DT pending instant finally got committed.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to minus the instant time with 1 millisecond, there is still possibility to conflict, but that is very rare case.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow medium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe `TableSchemaResolver` reads the schema from the log block.  The current way of instantiating log reader does not lazily read the content, causing the whole block content to be read, which is unnecessary.  During clustering, when clustering rewrites a file group that contains log files, it requires deriving the schema from the file group in the current logic.  Such logic happens in all paralleled threads on each file group on the Spark driver, causing OOM on the driver.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the `TableSchemaResolver` and `HoodieMetadataTableValidator` to read the log blocker header only for the schema and instant time, and avoid reading block content to reduce the memory requirement.\r\n\r\nA test is added for reading the log file.  The memory usage is manually verified.\r\n\r\nI have created follow-ups to improve the relevant logic in deriving schema and clustering: [HUDI-7584](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-7584), [HUDI-7585](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-7585), [HUDI-7586](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-7586).\r\n\r\nRelevant code before the fix:\r\n`TableSchemaResolver`:\r\n```\r\n  public static MessageType readSchemaFromLogFile(FileSystem fs, Path path) throws IOException {\r\n    try (Reader reader = HoodieLogFormat.newReader(fs, new HoodieLogFile(path), null)) {\r\n      HoodieDataBlock lastBlock = null;\r\n      while (reader.hasNext()) {\r\n        HoodieLogBlock block = reader.next();\r\n        if (block instanceof HoodieDataBlock) {\r\n          lastBlock = (HoodieDataBlock) block;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      return lastBlock != null ? new AvroSchemaConverter().convert(lastBlock.getSchema()) : null;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n`HoodieLogFormat.Reader`:\r\n```\r\n  static HoodieLogFormat.Reader newReader(FileSystem fs, HoodieLogFile logFile, Schema readerSchema)\r\n      throws IOException {\r\n    return new HoodieLogFileReader(fs, logFile, readerSchema, HoodieLogFileReader.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE, false);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nCall stack in clustering:\r\n<img width=\"629\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 15

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Adds partitionPath string to the HoodieBaseFile and HoodieLogFile to avoid computing it multiple times for a single instance of these files.\r\n- Minor optimization on partition path computation in case where CachingPath is not used\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n- Reduces overhead of constructing FSViews. We see a non-negligible amount of CPU time spent on computing the partition path for each file when it can actually simply be taken in as an input in some cases. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nHudi callback URL's doesn't support passing the custom headers as of now: https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/8834  \r\nImplemented a way to pass them and use it for callback:  \r\n- added config param `hoodie.write.commit.callback.http.custom.headers` to HoodieWriteConfig (HoodieWriteCommitCallbackConfig);\r\n- in this config param user can set all his custom headers in the form: `header_name1:value 1;header_name2:value2`;  \r\n- this string is parsed and send as http headers with callback request.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nDocumentation update: add config property `hoodie.write.commit.callback.http.custom.headers`\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nUpdated compact and logcompact to start a heartbeat (within a transaction) before attempting to execute a plan. If multiple writers attempt to execute same compact/logcompact plan at same time, only one of them will process and the rest will fail with an exception (upon seeing a heartbeat has already been started) and will abort.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nWithout this change, if multiple jobs are launched at the same that target executing the same compact/logcompact plan (due to a non-HUDI related user-side configuration/orchestration issue) then one job can execute the compact/logcompact plan and create an inflight/commit instant file while the other jobs can roll it back (and delete inflight instant files or data files). This can lead to timeline being in a corrupted state.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

introduced to ensure that hive-sync's behaviour is inline with Spark's externalCatalog table schema sync, which is used in AlterTableHoodieCommand.\r\n\r\nHive-sync is used to create the _ro and _rt tables of MOR.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nUpdated the config description for `hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.support_timestamp` to document that this is an intended inconsistency.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nSubtask of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-7045\r\nExtracts from https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/10278\r\n\r\nThis pr adds in schema evolution to the file readers. Additionally it refactors schema evolution so it is maintainable against ported code. Spark 2.4 has diverged from spark 3 schema evolution so I didn't refactor. \r\n\r\nTo review this pr, compare the schema evolution changes with the legacy file formats.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSubtask for schema evolution support in new fg reader\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n###

level index speeds up queries (when appropriate config properties are enabled) by pruning files based on metadata's RLI partition entries. The current implementation can prune files only when the query predicate has a EqalTo (i.e '=') OR In filters/expressions on the record-key column.\r\n\r\nHowever, the logic to detect if a 'In' query predicate references a record-key column is buggy. This can result in wrong results when the query predicate is a `In` expression ona  column other than record-key column. This seems like a serious bug that needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this problem and adds a unit test for the same.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe changes introduced are:\r\nRecordLevelIndexSupport.scala: The method `filterQueryWithRecordKey(...)` is where the bug exists. The switch-case for `In` expression was not filtering out expressions that are based on non-record-key columns. Fixed it correctly.\r\n\r\nTestRecordLevelIndexWithSQL.scala: Adds a unit test that clearly shows the problem with wrong results and the changes in this PR that fixes the wrong result issue.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nBug fix\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNone. No new configs are user visible options/changes added\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the jira ticket [HUDI-7564](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-7564) for a more detailed explanation.\r\n\r\nWhen investigating an error thrown by Trino/Presto queries involving Timestamp types:\r\n\r\n```log\r\n2024-04-02 17:32:21 (UTC+8) INFO - Clear session property for connection.\r\n2024-04-02 17:32:21 (UTC+8) ERROR- Task Execution failed with CommonException: Query failed (#20240402_093220_06724_cg4jg): Expected field to be long, actual timestamp(9) (field 0) \r\n```\r\n\r\nWe realised that there is a config inconsistency shown that indirectly causes the error thrown above. Trino/Presto requires that `TIMESTAMP` types to be synced to HMS as `LONG` types. \r\n\r\nThis should be the default behaviour as:\r\n```properties\r\nhoodie.datasource.hive_sync.support_timestamp=false\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, we realised that the default behaviour is overwritten by `buildHiveSyncConfig` when performing inserts via **Spark**, breaking our assumptions.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this inconsistency.\r\n\r\n**TLDR:** \r\nFix inconsistency\r\n```\r\nhoodie.datasource.hive_sync.support_timestamp = false  (HiveSyncConfigHolder - default)\r\nhoodie.datasource.hive_sync.support_timestamp = true   (ProvidesHoodieConfig#buildHiveSyncConfig )\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo impact\r\n\r\n### Risk level

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe wanna remove the very specific design for MDT so that it's behavior is in sync with the DT.\r\n\r\nThe criteria for simplification:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n1. use the instant timestamp from DT to commit to the MDT as much as possible for any delta_commit on MDT.\r\n2. for table sercives like cleaning, compaction and log_compaction, the timestamp is auto-generated.\r\n3. avoid to trigger multiple commits to MDT for one DT action. \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe async index instant suffix is also fixed.\r\n\r\nAlso simplify the logic for MDT delta instant validation for log reader.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow medium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThere is a chance that MDT could list additional partitions when compared to FS based listing. \r\n\r\nReason:\r\nWe load active timeline from metaclient and poll FS based listing for completed commits. And then we poll MDT for list of all partitions. in between these two, there could be a commit that could have been completed and hence MDT could be serving that as well. So, lets account for that in our validation tool \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nWe may have false positive validation failures from MDT validators\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis [PR](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/7865) added a preloading from the MDT for the sake of performance but it also forces all the file group information into memory. This leads to higher memory usage than is required for the cleaner planner.\r\n\r\nChanges in this PR: \r\n- Adds new method to load a list of partitions\r\n- Adds new endpoint for Remote FS View\r\n- Removes old load-all call in the CleanPlanner constructor\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nLowers amount of memory required for the cleaner planner\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI
