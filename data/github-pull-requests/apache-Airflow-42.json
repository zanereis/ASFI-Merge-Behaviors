Type annotation correction:\r\n    - In the Airflow codebase, a return type was incorrectly annotated as None when it actually returns an int.\r\n    - While Python allows for flexible typing, accurate type annotations improve code clarity and catch potential errors early.\r\n1. Test coverage improvement:\r\n    - Some existing function tests were not comprehensive.\r\n    - Added more thorough unit tests to cover all conditional branches of the affected

are using DockerOperator for executions outside the cloud... and compared to KubernetesPodOperator I see a lot of problems when logs are emitted. This PR improves the situation:\r\n\r\n- If an image is pulled all layer status is posted to logs - mostly this is not of interest, added a cool new log group around\r\n- As logs from container are captured, log chunks are logged to stdout for Airflow. But chunks mostly contain multiple lines and if a lot of logs are emitted then... at point of retrieval the task_log_handler tries to sort messages by timestamp an fails if numeric content is in the docker logs and totally scrambles the result. Logs are with this PR split by line and the python logger prefix is added consistently on each line - like in K8sPodOperator.\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-28T20:38:56Z","updated_at":"2024-06-29T05:40:08Z","closed_at":"2024-06-29T05:40:03Z","merged_at":"2024-06-29T05:40:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"c8b7dc5ce69267e064307851be92ab56532df8d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2172800850,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwODUw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:improvement","name":"type:improvement","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

deployment and have noticed improvements in triggerer performance.\r\n\r\n### Following are the `Explain Analyze` outputs for the two SQL Alchemy relationship loading strategies\r\n\r\n#### **Triggerer Process**\r\n**Using `joinedload` in bulk_fetch method**\r\n```sql\r\n-> Nested loop left join  (cost=101 rows=95) (actual time=0.22..0.359 rows=3 loops=1)\r\n    -> Nested loop left join

(task_instance_1.trigger_id = `trigger`.id)  (cost=0.386 rows=1.55) (never executed)\r\n                    -> Index lookup on task_instance_1 using ti_dag_run (dag_id=dag_run_1.dag_id, run_id=dag_run_1.run_id)  (cost=0.386 rows=1.55) (never executed)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Using `selectin` for relationship between TaskInstance and Trigger**\r\n```sql\r\n-> Nested loop inner join  (cost=8.41 rows=8) (actual time=0.0409..0.0409 rows=0 loops=1)\r\n    -> Index range scan on task_instance using ti_trigger_id over (trigger_id = 109) OR (trigger_id = 110) OR (6 more), with index condition: (task_instance.trigger_id in (116,115,114,113,112,111,110,109))  (cost=5.61 rows=8) (actual time=0.0402..0.0402 rows=0 loops=1)\r\n    -> Single-row index lookup on dag_run_1 using dag_run_dag_id_run_id_key (dag_id=task_instance.dag_id, run_id=task_instance.run_id)  (cost=0.263 rows=1) (never executed)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom above `Explain Analyze` results, we can see that using `selectinload` is gives more optimal performance for triggerer process as well as the triggerview list api.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-28T20:12:37Z","updated_at":"2024-10-23T09:26:10Z","closed_at":"2024-09-18T17:36:29Z","merged_at":"2024-09-18T17:36:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"46b41e332f2d32962c0e3c14c1e5b8d052dfc359","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"hussein-awala","id":21311487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzExNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21311487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala","html_url":"https://github.com/hussein-awala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

order to locally develop and execute new providers with old sources you need to run breeze with `--use-airflow-version` and with the `--mount-sources` flag set to `providers-and-tests`. While for CI it worked with packages from dist, when you run it from sources, the providers mounted to inside container were not linked to where airflow has been installed. While this worked for tests, you could not really start airflow because the providers were not available. Also - even after removing the providers, the providers and providers/common folder remained inside installed airflow path.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes both problems:\r\n\r\n* in case there are any left-over \"providers\" directory in airflow installation location, it is removed\r\n\r\n* the mounted sources of providers are symbolically linked to that airflow installation folder, making the provider folders available for import for airflow.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Why this change?\r\nrelated: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/40039 which is inspired https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/34206\r\n\r\nWe want to allow `DatasetEvent` and `Dataset` to be created in a task dynamically.\r\n\r\ne.g.,\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@task(outlets=[DatasetAlias(\"my-task-outputs\")])\r\ndef my_task(*, ds, outlet_events):\r\n    outlet_events[\"my-task-outputs\"].add(Dataset(f\"s3://bucket/my-task/{ds}\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What's change?\r\n\r\nIntroduced `DatasetAlias` which support the following syntax to create a `Dataset` and a `DatasetEvent` dynamically\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@task(outlets=[DatasetAlias(\"my-task-outputs\")])\r\ndef my_task_with_outlet_events(*, ds, outlet_events):\r\n    outlet_events[\"my-task-outputs\"].add(Dataset(f\"s3://bucket/my-task/{ds}\"))\r\n\r\n@task(outlets=[DatasetAlias(\"my-task-outputs\")])\r\ndef my_task_with_metadata(*, ds):\r\n    s3_dataset = Dataset(f\"s3://bucket/my-task/{ds}\")\r\n    yield Metadata(s3_dataset, extra={\"k\": \"v\"}, alias=\"my-task-outputs\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Note\r\nThis PR only supports part of the https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/40039. It does not yet support scheduling based on `DatasetAlias` (will create another PR for that)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

`apache-airflow>=2.10.0,<3.0` as it will require Airflow 2.10 and it is assumed due to planned breaking changes it will not work with Airflow 3.0 anymore.\r\n\r\nNote: Thought about a pytest but

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/34023\r\nprevious attempts: #34337 (and subsequent #36462 which has been stale and closed)\r\nrelated issues: #35541\r\n\r\nports: #44937\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR deals with handling pre-mature evaluation of tasks in mapped task group, which happens when using one of the \"fast\" trigger rules, and specifically `ONE_FAILED` [1]. This PR adds the exact logic presented by @uranusjr and @ephraimbuddy in the previous attempt (#34337), with a slight modification to be executed only for the appropriate trigger rules (the previous attempt has been reverted due to a [bug](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/34337#issuecomment-1721605099) that it caused). The slight modification is rather adding a simple `if` statement, which seems to do the job.\r\nFor a more robust and performent solution, I think that eventually we'll have to completely refactor the trigger rule dependencies (as their code is quite messy atm).\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Theoretically it might also happen in the other \"fast\" trigger rules (`ONE_SUCCESS`, `ONE_DONE`), but I couldn't come up with good test case for that.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Return value of `BigQueryInsertJobOperator's` `execute_complete()` (so execution in deferrable mode) will now be an actual BQ job id instead of None. As described in [this](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/authoring-and-scheduling/deferring.html#triggering-deferral) docs, when deferring: `No state will persist, such as local variables or attributes set on self.`, so assigning value to self.job_id within `execute()` had no effect and was not actually used in `execute_complete()`.\r\n\r\n2. We are re-assigning the job_id in `execute_complete()` as an instance attribute, so that we can later use it within OpenLineage method even when in deferrable mode. We are also re-creating any attributes (hook) that may be missing as a result of the state keeping logic mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^

we have rules [D212](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/multi-line-summary-first-line/) and [D213](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/multi-line-summary-second-line/) on the ruff ignore list in [pyproject,toml](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/pyproject.toml#L300).  They are conflicting rules and I want to propose that we work towards enabling one of them.  In a nutshell:\r\n```\r\nclass Banana():\r\n    \"\"\"This is a D212-style docstring.\r\n\r\n    Note that the summary line of a multi-line docstring is the first physical line, immediately \r\n    following the opening triple-quote.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Apple():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    This is a D213-style docstring.\r\n\r\n    Note that the opening triple-quote is followed by a newline in this multi-line \r\n    docstring, giving the mandatory (per D205, which we already enforce) \r\n    one-line summary its own line.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nPersonally, I always use D213 style when I write multiline doc strings and I find it easier on the eyes.  When I enabled it and ran static checks, ruff actually auto-fixed all instances so this is an easy one to enable if we want to.\r\n\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nChanges\r\n---\r\n- `pyproject.toml` - Manually moved D213 from the exclude list to the run list and added the comments about conflicting rules.\r\n- Ran static checks locally and ruff automatically modified all other files.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\nRelated:  https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/10742\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

The choice between rendering a text input (single line) or a textarea (multiline) is based on the presence of a new line character in any of the examples of the Param.\r\nFor instance, the following code generates a multiline input:\r\n```python\r\nParam(\r\n    description=\"a parameter that is rendered better with a textarea\",\r\n    type=[\"string\", \"null\"],\r\n    examples=[\"first line of text before\\na new line\"],\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know Params of type \"array\" are rendered as textareas but forcing our end-users to format their multiline text into an array of strings would not be very friendly :). So it seems more practical to leave the Param as a \"string\" type and work on the rendering options instead.\r\n\r\nThe patch is merely a PoC to showcase what the feature would look like and by no means a definitive solution. I think that relying on the `examples` attribute is more a hack than a solution, but adding a new explicit attribute to the Param object is beyond my understanding of Airflow. So feel free to rewrite it completely if you think the feature is worth it.","created_at":"2024-06-25T01:29:53Z","updated_at":"2024-09-10T17:22:03Z","closed_at":"2024-09-10T17:22:00Z","merged_at":"2024-09-10T17:22:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"46306f55f64a53aa23f50d0c5dad9b3cde942abc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"i

Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIf you run `breeze release-management prepare-provider-documentation` and generate the docs, like for [this PR](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/40273) and if the PR isn't merged because of whatever reason, you need to rebase and rerun the command to update the docs.\r\n\r\nThe problem is the command doesn't notify you or let you change versions on the fly. It generated docs for version 8.24.1, but after rebasing, you need to update it to 8.25.0 due to [this addition](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/40287). The command only confirms the current version, forcing you to manually edit provider.yaml and rerun it.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds changes that offer to change the version (bug, feature, major etc)\r\n\r\nExample output:\r\n```\r\n➜  airflow git:(breezeImprovement2) ✗ breeze release-management prepare-provider-documentation amazon\r\nGood version of Docker: 25.0.3.\r\nGood version of docker-compose: 2.24.6\r\nExecutable permissions on entrypoints are OK\r\nFetching full history and tags from remote.\r\nThis might override your local tags!\r\nFrom

parallell tests start on CI, they are running parallel docker compose's and on a clean machine in CI this means that every parallel test is pulling the images needed to run tests. This means that backend images are pulled in parallell by all starting parallel runs.\r\n\r\nThis PR optimizes this step - before running the tests in parallel we run `docker compose pull` once with the same compose files as tests - this will pull the necessary images only once.\r\n\r\nIt should save a few seconds and save a lot of unnecessary traffic for CI tests - where same image is pulled multiple times - especially for self-hosted runners of ours where we run 8 docker compose instances in parallel.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
