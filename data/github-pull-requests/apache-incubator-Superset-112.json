SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nCurrently the examples that come with Superset are all generated by Python scripts, making modifying the existing examples or creating new ones unnecessarily complicated.\r\n\r\nWith the new export/import functionality from [SIP-54](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11167) we can store the examples in the repo as YAML files instead of code. This way the examples can be easily modified, and new examples can be created inside Superset, exported and added to the repo.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I moved the \"Unicode test\" example to YAML files. Doing so required a few modifications, namely, adding a `data` attribute to the dataset config pointing to a URL where the data can be download as a CSV. This is similar to how `load_examples` currently work, with the difference that we don't know the column types a priori, so they need to be inferred from the dataset metadata.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

was finding it strangely tedious to have to click the global nav menus to open them. Hover-opening seemed lie it'd be more natural. Not sure others will agree, but if they do, we can merge this PR after that one.\r\n\r\nCurious what others think, e.g. @junlincc @ktmud @mihir174\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nWe would like to publish release notes with each major release. This is a first crack at sorting out the format for the release notes, starting with v0.38. These are the decision points that would benefit from feedback or objections, and will likely see iteration in future release notes:\r\n- Multimedia embedded in the release notes vs no multimedia\r\n- A single .md file with each new version's notes appended vs a separate .md file and directory for each release\r\n- Directory structure for release notes\r\n- How the release notes are linked to the top level README.md\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR make a suggestion for each of those points.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nNo testing required, no changes to codebase. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has

SUMMARY\r\nRemoves all [anchor-is-valid](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/blob/master/docs/rules/anchor-is-valid.md) lint warnings.\r\n\r\nAll anchor tags that were being used as a button and not making use of `href` were replaced by a similar component. A component called `Link` were always being used as an icon button and no valid `href` so I renamed to `IconTooltip`. We already have a `Link` component in `react-router-dom`.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit of this change is that the icon buttons now have their colors provided by Emotion using the theme. I noticed that some of the icons are coming from images/icons and some are coming from bootstrap classes. When we unify all this we can create an icon property in IconTooltip of a type available in images/icons. For now I kept the use of class names for icon definition.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe layout of dashboards is stored in the `position_json` attribute, containing the position and ID of charts. When a dashboard layout hasn't been modified the attribute is empty, and the relationship between which charts are contained in a given dashboard exists only in the `dashboard_slices` table and **is not exported**.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, if `position_json` is empty we add a default position to the attribute, so that the relationship between dashboards and charts is present in the export bundle. This doesn't change the layout, but allows us to extract the relationship when importing the dashboard together with the charts.\r\n\r\nOne alternative to this PR would be explicitly listing the UUIDs of charts when we export a dashboard, eg:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# dashboards/some_dashboard.yaml\r\ndashboard_title: Test Import [copy]\r\ndescription: null\r\ncss: ''\r\nslug: null\r\nuuid: a1a7dd04-d113-46b8-8cb9-29b9eef280f4\r\nchart_uuids:\r\n- foo\r\n- bar\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut since most dashboards will have the `position_json` attribute set, it seems more efficient to populate it when it's empty.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR optimizes fetching samples. The goal is not to refetch on every change in controls panel, but only when filters change, because only filters affect the response of samples endpoint.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nVerify that we refetch samples only when filters change either in Networking tab of browser console or visually, by seeing that there's no spinner that indicates fetching data.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: Closes https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11968\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\nCC: @mistercrunch @rusackas @junlincc @adam-stasiak

SUMMARY\r\nWhen chart is loading, we show a spinner icon on top of chart, but it won't block user interact with chart. This will cause some issue for filter box: In large dashboard with many filter box, user applies a filter, other filter may update accordingly. If user interact with filter box while it is waiting for query results, it will make dashboard stuck in a wired state or show errors.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to add an invisible layer on top of chart.  When chart is loading, user can not interact with the chart. There is no visible UI change for loading chart, but user can not change filter dropdown:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"576\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-12-09 at 11 34 02 PM\"

filter boxes: both dashboard and filter box should aligned as before.\r\n1. apply one filter, \r\n1. when filter box is loading, you can not select dropdown anymore.\r\n\r\ncc @zuzana-vej @etr2460

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nDashboards reference charts by their IDs in their JSON attributes (`position_json` and `json_metadata`). When importing a dashboard we need to update the IDs to the new ones, since imported charts will probably have different IDs.\r\n\r\nIn this PR we use the chart UUID to update references to charts inside the metadata of dashboards.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen deleting an asset we ask the user for confirmation with this phrase:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nt('type \"delete\" to confirm')\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich in Portuguese, eg, translates to _**digite \"apagar\" para confirmar**_. But if the user types in \"apagar\" it won't work. :-P\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the bug by comparing the user input with the translated version of \"delete\".\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nThere are currently no translations for the strings, so I couldn't test in a different language. But confirmed that it still works in English.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

SUMMARY\r\nInside airbnb, we spent a lot of time on Superset dashboard and query performance issues. We create some guidelines for airbnb users, to help them write better queries to create virtual dataset. So we want to **_add a dataset health check logic_** when user explore a chart, and show some warning message if health check returns any message.\r\n\r\nTo decide whether a dataset is good or bad, this logic is probably very specific to each corporation. Some rules applied in airbnb may totally not relevant for Dropbox. So in the open source codebase, we only add an entry point, \r\n```DATASET_HEALTH_CHECK = _your function to check dataset quality_```\r\nwhich allow each company to implement and hook their own rules.\r\n\r\nFor example, after implements a rule that checks if the chart is using a virtual dataset:\r\n```\r\ndef my_check(datasource: SqlaTable) -> str:\r\n    message = None # pass the check no warning\r\n    if datasource.type == \"table\" and datasource.sql:\r\n        message = \"You should replace this virtual datasource with physical table.\"\r\n    return message\r\n\r\nDATASET_HEALTH_CHECK = my_check\r\nDATASET_HEALTH_CHECK.version = 0.1\r\n```\r\nI will see a warning message like this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1406\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-12-08 at 8 31 33 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/101587949-1f6e4800-399a-11eb-88a1-84c13ff1ddae.png\">\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\nThe health_check result will be saved with datasource record `extra` column. _When user update datasource, or `DATASET_HEALTH_CHECK.version` is changed_, health_check function will be triggered again and update the record in the database. Please see how we discussed [different ideas for this feature](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/856#discussion_r539673938). \r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\nFixes bugs https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11623 and https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11835. `AlteredSliceTag` was crashing because it was using a `ListView` component, which requires access to React Router to work (which Explore view doesn't have). I replaced it with newer `TableView` to display a table.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: see linked issue\r\nAfter:\r\n![ezgif com-gif-maker

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCI has been slow recently. This PR is the latest effort in trying to mitigate:\r\n\r\n1. Update the Cancel Previous Run job added in #11940 to cancel future jobs as well.\r\n2. Skip dependabot branches when possible (e.g. don't run Python jobs for npm updates).\r\n3. Merge lighter actions (Prefer Typescript and License Check) into one workflow.\r\n4. Add a script to allow committers to manually cancel CI jobs in queue. This is useful on a busy day when the CI pipeline got clogged by continuous new commits to open PRs. Users have to configure [`GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://github.com/settings/tokens) in their env variables in order to use this.\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   (superset) ‚ûú  incubator-superset

Replace `path_no_int` with [request.url_rule](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/api/#flask.Request.url_rule), the match pattern used in Flask router\r\n2. Make sure JSON payload works for REST API requests\r\n3. Make sure to collect `rison` objects when present, and remove the raw query string.\r\n4. Use `ClassName.method` as `action` for REST API and add `__qualname__` to `object_ref` for legacy actions. \r\n5. Accept functions as `action` and `object_ref` in the decorators\r\n6. Rename decorator `log_manually` to `log_this_with_extra_payload`\r\n\r\nThe goal is to make future analytic queries on the `logs` table as easy as possible and reduce redundancy.\r\n\r\ncc

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nI happened to notice a few files were directly using the `supersetTheme` from `superset-ui` directly. It's better to use the theme inherited via the `ThemeProvider` at the top of the React apps, so that we can mutate/override/append that base `supersetTheme` at the provider level, and have all the react components inherit that theme properly.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n(should be no visible change at this point)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n@junlincc and I will poke around to make sure nothing looks out of place.

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen running multiple statements, BigQuery will not keep track of state during the lifetime of the cursor. This means that queries like this one will fail:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nDECLARE d DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE();\r\nCREATE TEMP FUNCTION Add(x INT64, y INT64) AS (x + y);\r\nSELECT Add(3, 4);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee discussion here: https://github.com/googleapis/python-bigquery/issues/377\r\n\r\nThis PR solves this problem by running queries as a single statement\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER
