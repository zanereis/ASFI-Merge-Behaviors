PR enhance temporary directories and subcontent handling for RPC server.\r\n\r\n---\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\n* It fix \"no space left\" for small devices like rk3399 or rpi where disk space is scarce, or even worse the very /tmp is a ramdisk:\r\n```\r\n[root@rk3399 tmp]# df -h | grep '/tmp'\r\nnone            1.9G  168K  1.9G   1% /tmp\r\n```\r\n---\r\nFixes:\r\n\r\n1. In case of timeout (quite frequent) the RPC subprocess [join(timeout)](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/python/tvm/rpc/server.py#L207) receive SIGTERM so have no chance to clean, but [root process can do](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/3574/files#diff-db3f1c8882ec8257706c885bf280f661R214) the cleaning instead.\r\n2. In case of ```untar```-ing,  make sure unpacking occur in [already existing](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/3574/files#diff-82e4b32f06c6b90becbb21b77980d666R254) root temporary no need another new one (will be not cleaned at SIGTERM), thus this new root temporary can be erased too by the master process.\r\n---\r\n\r\n@eqy, @zhiics, @vinx13, @kevinthesun \r\nCan help review ?\r\n\r\nThank you

Summary\r\n\r\nThis is an alternative implementation of a subset of the TVM runtime API (and\r\ngraph runtime) that focuses entirely on reducing code size, at the expense of\r\nfunctionality (no tvm.extern(..) calls via PackedFunc, CPU only, etc). It might\r\nbe worth incrementally expanding the surface area if there's interest.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this work was seeing what the minimal useful subset of the\r\nTVM runtime is. This is relevant for e.g. super code-size constrained\r\napplications in e.g. embedded/mobile. The current runtime is more like O(100KiB)\r\nor so, so this might be compelling for some users.\r\n\r\nThe smaller surface area for auditing might make this relevant for\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/3159, or the usecases I was thinking about in\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/2523#issuecomment-459165815 re: the Rust\r\nruntime.\r\n\r\n## Analysis\r\n\r\nThe symbols in the tvm::minimalruntime space (i.e. excluding std:: and\r\npicojson::) are about 5KiB, so I think there's a bunch of room here (i.e. we\r\ncould replace picojson:: with [`jsmn`](https://zserge.com/jsmn.html) or\r\nsomething, and we could replace more of the `std::unordered_map` usage, etc with\r\ncustom primitives as well (similar to the `DynArray`).","created_at":"2019-07-18T00:24:01Z","updated_at":"2019-09-12T19:32:46Z","closed_at":"2019-09-12T19:32:02Z","merged_at":"2019-09-12T19:32:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"1de52bb0109af3e7051a573c2b8fa2f039c3d05d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

Motivation\r\n\r\nWe observe multiple groups across a range of domains (ASR, NMT, LM, etc), internally and externally, interested in replacing standard dense layers with block-sparse matrix multiplication layers. The motivations are generally: higher performance (due to reduction in FLOPs, memory bandwidth/cache footprint), enabling larger models (e.g. fitting more layers in a given memory budget). \r\n\r\nSome public work along these lines:\r\n\r\n* https://openai.com/blog/block-sparse-gpu-kernels/\r\n* https://openai.com/blog/sparse-transformer/\r\n* https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08435\r\n* https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02782\r\n\r\nVarious groups have been able to successfully train models with reasonable levels of sparsity (90%+) with marginal accuracy changes, which suggests substantial speedups are possible (as this implies a >10x reduction in FLOPs).\r\n\r\nIt is fairly straightforward to realize these theoretical speedups, see e.g. TVM benchmarks for Intel CPUs in https://gist.github.com/ajtulloch/e65f90487bceb8848128e8db582fe902, and CUDA results in https://github.com/openai/blocksparse, etc.\r\n\r\n## Existing libraries/Prior Art\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/openai/blocksparse (CUDA)\r\n* https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl-developer-reference-c-mkl-bsrmm (MKL BSRMM)\r\n* https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.bsr_matrix.html (SCIPY BSR representation)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR details\r\n\r\nThis is extracted from an internal patch we've been using internally. There are various extensions possible (int8/fp16/bf16, CUDA/other GPU architectures), but this is a reasonable starting point. This needs more thorough unit test coverage however. \r\n\r\nWe follow the conventions established by scipy.sparse.bsr_matrix and other libraries, see the unit tests for details.\r\n\r\nFor folks interested in experimenting with scheduling/AutoTVM etc, https://gist.github.com/ajtulloch/e65f90487bceb8848128e8db582fe902 is a useful starting point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-17T18:16:53Z","updated_at":"2019-07-23T21:45:04Z","closed_at":"2019-07-23T21:44:28Z","merged_at":"2019-07-23T21:44:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"d6dcd6c56febfbb12efe67884c188f045f435893","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

the current master branch, when converting mxnet model to tvm model with operations in the title, the conversion will fail for the following reason:\r\n1. **l2_normalize**: `'Value of attribute \"mode\" must equal \"channel\" or \"instance\" for operator l2_normalize.'`\r\n2. **prelu**: `an internal invariant was violated while typechecking your program [14:50:45] /home/arkenstone/tvm/src/relay/pass/type_solver.cc:119: Check failed: resolved.defined(): Unable to unify parent types: TensorType([64], float32) and TensorType([1], float32)`\r\n3. **Pad**: `Op not found in frontend mxnet`\r\n\r\nIt seems all these ops have already be supported by `tvm.relay.op.nn`, so eliminating these errors is quite simple:\r\nFor 'l2_norm', according to mxnet [document](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/symbol/symbol.html#mxnet.symbol.L2Normalization), the difference between mode 'channel' and 'instance' is the axis to do normalization with the tensor, where 'instance' is 0 and 'channel' is 1.\r\nFor 'prelu', it is due to dimension mismatch, so we need to broadcast the alpha parameter from [1] to the same dimension as input tensor.\r\nFor pad, just wrap `tvm.relay.nn.pad` and add it to frontend mxnet operations. \r\n\r\nCan any help review it?

runtime refactor will make it easier to support FPGAs that do not rely on shared memory with the host (most PCI-E based FPGA systems).\r\n\r\nThe idea is to allocate instruction and micro op buffers right before invoking the VTA accelerator: this will let us allocate and transfer the buffers from main memory to an \"FPGA-readable\" buffer. For the Pynq FPGA, that can be a buffer that was allocated using `cma_alloc()` to obtain a physically contiguous buffer in memory; or for an F1 FPGA, that means allocating a buffer in the FPGA DRAM that the FPGA can access.\r\n\r\nIn terms of micro-op the challenge is that the earlier runtime would copy the kernels as they get JITed to the FPGA-readable buffer. Here we wait until we synchronize with VTA to do that: we size the FPGA buffer to be just-the-right width based on the kernel that we have to ship; then we copy them over one by one. In addition, we need to keep track of the physical addresses of these kernels now that they are in FPGA-readable memory. This means that we have to retroactively modify the DRAM source address in the `load_uop` instructions in the instruction stream since those are added to the stream as kernels are JITted.","created_at":"2019-07-16T23:52:57Z","updated_at":"2019-08-02T18:12:03Z","closed_at":"2019-07-22T15:31:38Z","merged_at":"2019-07-22T15:31:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"9d64d321435d9149058b151644b51425d183a9e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/3554/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/3554/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3554/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/2e8a3bb4e25c4cb03d642b454a4155255b0aa0f1","head":{"label":"tmoreau89:runtime","ref":"runtime","sha":"2e8a3bb4e25c4cb03d642b454a4155255b0aa0f1","user":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119757672,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTk3NTc2NzI=","name":"tvm","full_name":"tmoreau89/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89/tvm","description":"bring

This patch adds Winograd (Cook-Toom) matrices computation routines as described by [A. Lavin & S. Gray](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Lavin_Fast_Algorithms_for_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) based on original [wincnn](https://github.com/andravin/wincnn) implementation of [Andrew Lavin](https://github.com/andravin). Also removes actual hard coded redundant matrices.\r\n\r\nIt opens the door to:\r\n * Other **kernel_sizes** than (3x3), also more **tile_sizes** (1 < any < 9)\r\n * Allow adjusting **interpolation points** for better precision see discussion [1](https://github.com/andravin/wincnn/issues/8)\r\n * Allow custom **range scaling** for better precision see discussion [1](https://github.com/andravin/wincnn/issues/1) and [2](https://github.com/andravin/wincnn/issues/16)\r\n * Scaling ranges for **quantized ops** (int8), see: [Efficient Winograd Convolution via Integer Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.01965.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce this PR pass, will attempt with more winograd

PR introduces full relay support for the bitserial conv2d, dense, and bitpack operators. Although the current commits allow a relay function to be composed, built, and run, I suspect there are still a few missing features. For example, using relay.create_executor instead of relay.build causes the error\r\n```\r\nTVMError: Check failed: checked_type.as<IncompleteTypeNode>() == nullptr: Cannot resolve type of Var(w) at (nullptr)\r\n```\r\nThis makes it difficult to write tests in a way consistent with other relay operators. I'd appreciate feedback on what's missing so that I can fix this issue and add the proper tests.","created_at":"2019-07-16T21:17:33Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T15:56:44Z","closed_at":"2019-07-16T21:43:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"241225ffb6138260856d4e35aff9059332bf3630","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/3551/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/3551/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/3551/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/d45ed8322287381e3542607a9e006cc6d1122d5d","head":{"label":"jwfromm:relay_bitserial","ref":"relay_bitserial","sha":"d45ed8322287381e3542607a9e006cc6d1122d5d","user":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185874049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU4NzQwNDk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"jwfromm/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm/tvm","description":"Open

KL divergence algorithm ported from MXNet quantization\r\n* `CollectStats` pass that collects input of each `simulated_quantize` in annotated graph into a tuple output\r\n* Support floating-point scale\r\n* `max_scale` as an alternative for `power2_scale` in weight quantization\r\n\r\n### Evaluation code\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/vinx13/6f1eb1f9e2c0a8786149ee881bfcd6aa\r\n\r\n### What's left:\r\n* ~~I added `QAnnotateKind.BIAS`. I'm not sure whether it is necessary. Currently there are a few tricks in handling bias (nbit_bias, valid_range, ...). It would be good to find a better solution and avoid these tricks.~~\r\n* In my evaluation script, I have to write quantization workflow by myself (optimize, annotate, calibrate, realize). Please also share your thought on the design of `calibrate` function. We need to decide how users can specify different ways of quantization (max, power2, KLD, ...)\r\n\r\n### Evaluation result on ImageNet:\r\n#### max_scale for weights, KL divergence for activations:\r\n\r\nresnet18_v1, 0.70642 / 0.89702\r\nresnet50_v1, 0.73682 / 0.91664\r\nresnet101_v1, 0.74484 / 0.9208\r\nresnet18_v2, 0.70794 / 0.89832\r\nresnet50_v2, 0.7691 / 0.93268\r\nresnet101_v2, 0.78204 / 0.94124\r\n\r\n#### power2 for weights, KL divergence restricted to power2 value for activations (use --eval-power2 option in my evaluation script):\r\n\r\nresnet18_v1, 0.70332 / 0.89526\r\nresnet50_v1, 0.73426 / 0.9146\r\nresnet101_v1, 0.72434 / 0.91058\r\nresnet18_v2, 0.70314 / 0.89618\r\nresnet50_v2, 0.76486 / 0.93108\r\nresnet101_v2, 0.78066 / 0.94002\r\n\r\nThese experiments are done under `opt_level=2`. When `opt_level=3`, `FoldScaleAxis` might generate some outliers in bias vector and cause significant accuracy drops.

PR add support for roundtripping relay code from/to string.\r\nRight now, it support roundtripping all the defined network, and I think this is a good time to wrap up and merge.\r\nA few things to discuss:\r\nDoc does not accept string input with newline/tab any more, as it will interfere with the layout algorithm that will land in the future.\r\nThe printing strategy is ugly for anfed code. It will print a variable, then graph that variable.\r\nSimilarly, there should be inline ability for simple expression such as a + b + c, instead of always allocate graph var.\r\nFuncOp is highly redundant. Can we get this information with tvm?\r\nI copied the josn pretty printer so it use Doc Style.\r\nsince ppl do assert alpha_equal all the time, I build it into alpha_equal to give better error message.\r\n\r\nFuture Work:\r\n0: pattern matching/adt/fatal/ref for both pretty printing/parser\r\n1: doc.h do not have a layout engine - right now it will emit the same string regardless of screen width/remaining space\r\n2: indentation is off - nested let look incredibly broken\r\n3: every tree - style program will still make a graph var for everything, so it is impossible to display code that resemble sml\r\n4: deprecate the old json pretty printer?\r\n5: src/error.cc often do not display error message for unknown reason\r\n6: more principle solution for dealing with literal\r\n7: to do attrs in alphaequal extensibly\r\n8: handle floating point equality\r\n\r\nTired and Sleepy.

PR provides the following:\r\n\r\n* Adds two new API calls for handling hardware simulation, including Wait and Resume. This preserves the state of VTA between VTADeviceRun invocations. The hardware simulation thread is now launched from `from vta.testing import simulator` and terminated when the tvm-python-script finished.\r\n\r\n* A new VTA DPI function called `VTASimDPI` that handles all simulation related tasks.\r\n\r\n* Unified simulation statistics. TSIM now shares the same APIs as the functional simulator, making it easier to be used in current testing infrastructure without much modification.\r\n\r\n* Updated TSIM example and VTA tests to

the VTA codebase to allow for increased FPGA platform coverage.\r\n\r\n~Currently WIP.~\r\n\r\nedit: Summary of code changes\r\n- Transition to Vivado 2018.3\r\n- Small refactor of VTA HLS code base: index derivation of instruction fields is now implicit; we use bitfields instead to get an automated layout\r\n- `vta_config.json` is now simplified - all FPGA specific parameters are now derived from the target in `pkg_config.py`, and `BLOCK_IN` and `BLOCK_OUT` are fused into `BLOCK`\r\n- Parameter derivation is mostly done in `pkg_config.py` to simplify argument passing to tcl scripts\r\n- Adding preliminary Ultra96 support, although e2e support is pending on heterogeneous runtime

PR enables users to provide the interested passes for debugging during optimization. For example, users can provide a certain pass name for dumping. The module IR will be dumped after this passes is applied.\r\n\r\nAn example could be like the following:\r\n```python\r\n    shape = (1, 2, 3)\r\n    t = relay.TensorType(shape, \"float32\")\r\n    x = relay.var(\"x\", t)\r\n    y = relay.add(x, x)\r\n    y = relay.multiply(y, relay.const(2, \"float32\"))\r\n    func = relay.Function([x], y)\r\n\r\n    seq = _transform.Sequential([\r\n        relay.transform.InferType(),\r\n        relay.transform.FoldConstant(),\r\n        relay.transform.DebugPrint(),\r\n        relay.transform.DeadCodeElimination()\r\n    ])\r\n\r\n    mod =

their result will be thrown away, so it cannot help e.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we cps the program, it will become\r\n> let f a = e in if b then f c else f d\r\n\r\nwith e inlined, and possible to do further simplification base on the partial evaluator result of c/d.\r\nThere are two big design choice this commit to:\r\n\r\n- polymorphic continuation because we want to type check things. this mean we move from HM to System F.\r\n- CPS itself. It is somewhat un-revertable, and has implication on further optimization. Some say it is good while some say it is bad.\r\n\r\nWe should discuss a bit.\r\n@jroesch @tqchen @nhynes
