SUMMARY\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Default `FILTER_STATE_CACHE_CONFIG` and `EXPLORE_FORM_DATA_CACHE_CONFIG` to `SimpleCache` when app is in debug mode.\r\n- Replace old `CACHE_TYPE` references to the deprecated `null` type with `NullCache` and others (see: https://flask-caching.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#configuring-flask-caching)\r\n- Clean up `CacheConfig` type that had  a remnant from #9020 where a callable `CacheConfig` was supported, but was removed in #10887. TL;DR: now only `Dict[str, Any]` types are supported.\r\n- Raise an exception if trying to start up the application with a `NullCache` backend for required caches (Explore or Dashboard)\r\n- Update docs\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently there are a few problems in Explore view:\r\n- if `url_params` are present in chart metadata, it's impossible to set new URL params to a chart in Explore view\r\n- When saving a chart, the following error toast is emitted: \"Form data not found in cache, reverting to chart metadata.\". See screenshot below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/155984186-b9ef5b9a-63c8-4910-8fe6-d5004a4df4bb.png)\r\n\r\nThis PR changes how the hidden control [`url_params`](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/2072225a8637299c23c337966c9d5aaaeaaa732b/superset-frontend/src/explore/controlPanels/sections.tsx#L56-L64) is handled by no longer be persisting it in chart metadata or cached chart form data. This is done by changing the following:\r\n- Remove the error message about form data missing from cache if `form_data_key` is not present in the URL (sort of unrelated, but a regression nonetheless).\r\n- Remove the `url_params` property from `form_data` if present before saving chart metadata\r\n- Adds the removed `url_params` back to the URL during saving in the frontend so that the reloaded Explore/Dashboard view will retain the URL params that were present before saving chart metadata\r\n- Adds an integration test for `CreateChartCommand` (bycatch - it was missing) and updates related unit tests\r\n\r\nNote that charts that currently rely on default URL params that are persisted in chart data will still work like before - however, when the chart is saved/overwritten, the `url_params` state will be lost. So when making changes to old charts that are using the `url_param` function in templating code and haven't set default value as the second argument, users will need to update the `url_param` call to include the default value.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. enable `ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PROCESSING` feature flag\r\n4. Crete a new chart using the `flights` dataset\r\n5. Add a groupby for `AIRLINE`, a metric for `COUNT(*)` and a filter for `AIRLINE IN ('{{ url_param('test') }}')`\r\n6. Add the param `test=AA` to the URL\r\n7. Save chart\r\n8. See error toast (no longer happens after PR)\r\n9. remove the URL param and reload the chart\r\n10. Notice that the URL param `test=AA` reappears (no longer happens after PR)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe reason why the bug (view attached issue) occurred in the first place was because there was a local variable within the TabbedSqlEditors component called \"queryCount\". Whenever the component was reloaded/re-rendered, it caused this local variable to reset to it's default integer value of: '1'. Since this variable is reset to 1, the naming of the new query tabs would not work as intended.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, I decided to use a more dynamic method of naming the new query tabs:\r\n- If there are no currently open query tabs, create the new one with a name of: \"Untitled Query 1\"\r\n- If there are currently open query tabs, but none of them are named \"Untitled Query #\" (Where # is a valid integer value), the new query tab will be named: \"Untitled Query 1\"\r\n- If there are currently open query tabs and one or more of them are named \"Untitled Query #\" (Where # is a valid integer value), parse the untitled query names so that you are left with a list of all of the numbers. Select the highest number, and add one to it. The new query tab will have the name: \"Untitled Query #\" (Where # is a valid integer value, and is +1 of the previous largest untitled query number)\r\n\r\nBy using this more dynamic method of naming new query tabs, it allows us to avoid creating and maintaining unnecessary state. It also fixes the issue where there never used to be an \"Untitled Query 1\".\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore: \r\n(the far right tab was created by selecting the \"SQL query\" button from the ‚Äú+‚Äú icon drop down on the top right of the web page beside the settings drop down)\r\n\r\n![After SQL query button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96579982/155753292-7cdcf32b-0caa-4bbb-9807-77c8364c403a.PNG)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n(The query tabs were created using a combination of the two add query buttons, this image shows that the naming now works correctly regardless of which way you decide to create a new query tab)\r\n\r\n![After SQL query button - with fix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96579982/155753255-bfd05206-d662-4350-bfc8-1a798f439997.PNG)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Go to the SQL Editor page by selecting it from the main menu under the \"SQL Lab\" drop down.\r\n2. Click on the \"+\" button next to the list of query tabs, it should properly increment the query tab names.\r\n3. Select the ‚Äú+‚Äú icon on the top right of the web page beside the settings drop down, and then click \"SQL query\".\r\n4. With the new code modifications, this second method of creating a query tab should also properly increment the query tab names.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR is a rebase of the original https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/14768 PR created by @akedrou. The original modifications made to the code were kept intact, however, to ensure that the feature works on master, I had to make some minor modifications to specific files.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Original PR's Summary:**\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new per-database configuration option to disable data preview queries in SQL Lab. This setting is exposed in the database API as allows_preview_data. I decided to add the feature to the database API and pass the database as a parameter to addTable rather than adding a database setting into a table API response (the proposed solution in https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/14726). As a result the data preview query was moved up to addTable as well. To my eye that looks cleaner since I don't think that previewing data should be a part of \"table metadata\" anyway.\r\n\r\nThere is no UI change, though the UX changes when data preview is disabled to not show the data preview pane (or results) when getting table metadata.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The original PR mentions that there is no UI change, this is no longer the case as there is now a new checkbox in the \"Advanced>SQL Lab\" section of a database settings page.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n**To test that the SQL Lab data preview works when the checkbox is selected**\r\n1. In the database configuration settings, select \"Allow SQL Lab data preview queries\" under \"Advanced>SQL Lab\".\r\n2. In SQL Editor, select the database you have configured, and then any schema or table.\r\n        - Alternately, trigger metadata to load from the editor textbox itself.\r\n4. Table metadata should load as normal, and a data preview query should run.\r\n\r\n**To test that the SQL Lab data preview is disabled when the checkbox is not selected**\r\n1. In the database configuration settings, unselect \"Allow SQL Lab data preview queries\" under \"Advanced>SQL Lab\".\r\n2. In SQL Editor, select the database you have configured, and then any schema or table.\r\n        - Alternately, trigger metadata to load from the editor textbox itself.\r\n3. Table metadata should load as normal, but no data preview query should run.\r\n\r\n**You can also run the following tests to make sure they still pass after the code modifications:**\r\n\r\n`npm test ./src/components/DatabaseSelector/DatabaseSelector.test.tsx`\r\n`npm test ./src/SqlLab/actions/sqlLab.test.js`\r\n`npm test ./src/SqlLab/components/SqlEditor/SqlEditor.test.jsx`\r\n`npm test ./src/SqlLab/components/SqlEditorLeftBar/SqlEditorLeftBar.test.jsx`\r\n\r\n`tox -e py38 -- tests/integration_tests/core_tests.py`\r\n`tox -e py38 -- tests/integration_tests/databases/api_tests.py`\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWhen you switch tabs in sql lab, we were keeping them all rendered in the dom, but hidden. This meant that everytime the sql lab redux state changed, we'd re-render all tabs that were viewed since the last page load. This prop is defined on antd tabs (https://ant.design/components/tabs/#API), and un-renders tabs that aren't currently selected, improving the perf of both switching tabs and updating the sql query being run.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\ngo to SQL Lab, change tabs and see the old tabs un-rendered from the DOM. Ensure all SQL Lab functionality still works\r\n\r\nto: @kgabryje @ktmud @rusackas @john-bodley

cache key e.g.:  \r\n\r\n ``` \"rls\": [\r\n    { \"clause\": \"publisher = '{{cache_key_wrapper('Nintendo')}}'\" }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same dashboard should have independent cache for each session, and the one with the rls clause should be unable to see unfiltered data.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nfix Jinja template is not working when the global async query is enabled.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Superset uses [serialized query_obj](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/16380906d1ba0f98b486cfec4b4b16ebed5b8a14/superset/common/query_context_processor.py#L156) and [form_data](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/16380906d1ba0f98b486cfec4b4b16ebed5b8a14/superset/jinja_context.py#L189-L199) to generate [query_cache_key](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/16380906d1ba0f98b486cfec4b4b16ebed5b8a14/superset/common/query_context_processor.py#L158). But in the global async query, we didn't pass form_data. We have to get cached data from the data cache and put the cache data to `g.form_data` to fix it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/155511464-b0f99a24-cb90-467e-ad2a-7e862d6fd769.mov\r\n\r\n### After\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/155512121-c2feea8f-e880-483f-b5c4-e4860cd5c88d.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nSort `TimeTableViz` (time series table) by the first metric descending. Currently, no sorting is applied, so time series tables show the \"first\" n series, which can be confusing to users and isn't very helpful. Sorting by the first metric descending is more consistent with other chart types.\r\n\r\nNote time series tables do not have a sort by control - might be better to add this in the future, but this should still an improvement for now.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCreate time series viz. Confirm that an order by clause exists in the query.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user scrolls to the bottom of filter bar and keeps scrolling, the whole dashboard starts scrolling. Filter bar should be independent from dashboard, so this PR detaches filter bar scroll from main window scroll.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/155324238-ad979a10-7884-4599-96dc-a1cb50ff4039.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/155324018-184b0dd8-5646-4770-86d7-08936bad8e9c.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open a dashboard with native filters\r\n2. Add multiple native filters and multiple charts, so that filters bar and dashboard are both scrollable\r\n3. Verify that scrolling while hovering over filters bar doesn't trigger scrolling of main window\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR implements the Filter Card component. Please note that as of now this component is not used anywhere - usages will be added in upcoming PRs.\r\n\r\nFilter card is a component that displays native filter's metadata in user-friendly, readable way.\r\nInformation displayed:\r\n- filter's name\r\n- filter's type\r\n- filter's scope\r\n- filter's dependencies\r\n\r\nFilter scope values:\r\n- \"All charts\" if every chart in the dashboard is in scope\r\n- \"Tab name 1, Tab name 2\" if \"Tab name 1\" and \"Tab name 2\" are filter scope's rootpath and every chart in those tabs is in scope\r\n- \"Tab name 1, Chart1\" if every chart in top level tab \"Tab name 1\" is in scope + \"Chart1\" from another tab is in scope\r\n- \"Chart1, Chart2\" if only those 2 charts are in scope and previous conditions are not fulfilled\r\n\r\nFilter dependencies:\r\n- list of native filters that current native filter is dependent on\r\n- clicking a name of dependency highlights the filter\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\nAddresses #18871, #18596, #16487, #13661. This allows users to query date columns outside the maximum ranges of pandas timestamps: `1677-09-22 00:12:43.145225` and `2262-04-11 23:47:16.854775807`.\r\n\r\nThe same fix as #14006, with a small additional fix for charts to hide the timestamps it cannot convert.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nSql Lab before:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30076090/155315294-63df3e8a-c03b-4c06-bbca-b15f1bbfc3c9.png)\r\n\r\nSql Lab after can query past the date ranges mentioned above:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30076090/155314512-2450154e-9b73-498b-9d4c-42123a4ee4d9.png)\r\n\r\nCharts before:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30076090/155315241-23c32087-479a-44a5-80ca-740133b38e5e.png)\r\n\r\nCharts after now show data, excluding the dates that reside outside this period:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30076090/155313496-917fb149-eab0-4fca-b788-5ef87e1656fb.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. In Sql lab, try running `select TIMESTAMP any_timestamp_outside_ranges_mentioned_above`\r\n2. In charts, select a timeseries chart, and add a column with date ranges outside what's supported in pandas in the `TIME COLUMN`, it should still return a chart successfully and omit showing the date ranges that are unsupported.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\n- [X] Has associated issue: fixes #18871, fixes #18596, fixes #16487\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ]

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nA recent migration of the docs site to Docusaurus in #17411 lost Google Analytics tracking. Here we add the same GA confs that were introduced in #11613 by leveraging the [`plugin-google-analytics`](https://docusaurus.io/docs/using-plugins/#docusaurusplugin-google-analytics) plugin that's included in the [`preset-classic`](https://docusaurus.io/docs/using-plugins/#docusauruspreset-classic) that's already in use. In addition, Docusaurus is bumped to the latest version as the configuration mechanism changed recently (see https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/5832 which was included in the `2.0.0-beta.10` release). A missing license property is added to the `package.json` file of the docs package.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nThe site looks the same as before:\r\n<img width=\"1791\"

I assume this was missed at some point since all other implementations of date filters set the endpoints to `[\"inclusive\", \"exclusive\"]` This resolves the issue.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSort exact match and startsWith matches in the Select component to top of the list. This improves the user experience when searching a very large list where a partial match may be sorted to the top even when an extract match exists only because the former ranks higher in lexicographic order.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/16414 tried to tackle this but the work was put on hold as the Select component was undergoing a significant migration and feature-enrichment. Now that it's more stable,  it's worth giving this problem another go.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\nPartial match may be sorted to the top if it ranks

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nOriginal report:\r\nWhen chart is at max length, pointer of the filter indicator is not pointing correctly. \r\n\r\nGrooming report:\r\n1. This issue is related to the placement of popover. We could use `bottomRight` as the placement of popover because all of filter badge icons are placed on top right corner of its section. \r\n2. Popover is being triggered for filter badge icons only for now. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n> BEFORE\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39701522/155219387-46baacc8-1452-4fef-b695-3689eda95671.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n> AFTER\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39701522/155219140-05dbef4d-6c0d-46bb-ac1f-16a909da247e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFix a bug where sever side chart data query errors were displayed as \"No results\" when the `/dashboard/[id]/datasets` API is slow. \r\n\r\n#### Background\r\n\r\n#15699 made loading full datasource info for Dashboard charts async, however, some chart types didn't handle incomplete datasource info properly, causing JS errors. #15993 fixed that by re-rendering the charts after the datasources are fully loaded. Then a ‚ÄúNo results\" state for dashboard chart container is introduced in \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\nCharts with server side errors may show as \"no results\":\r\n\r\n<img width=\"729\" alt=\"Xnip2022-02-22_11-17-46\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/155210656-f6a1e392-4579-4878-962a-bb9ba33b2840.png\">\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\nServer side errors correctly rendered as unexpected errors:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"736\" alt=\"Xnip2022-02-22_11-16-44\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/155210705-3f3b1e7f-585b-433f-a183-5c8b50146f69.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nHere's how to reproduce the bug:\r\n\r\n1. Go to a dashboard where the dashboard/datasets API may be slow---e.g. dashboard that used a large dataset with a lot of columns\r\n2. Make sure users have access control error (or any other server side errors) when accessing one of the charts\r\n2. Refresh the page until you see the datasets API returns later than the chart data api:\r\n    <img width=\"430\" alt=\"Xnip2022-02-22_12-05-00\"

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes an issue for which the Pivot Table V2 would fail when the \"Sort by\" control was cleared with D&D enabled.\r\nThe reason for the failure was that when the \"Sort by\" was cleared, the `series_limit_metric` was passed as an empty array due to the default behavior of the Select control.\r\nWith the changes in this PR, the `series_limit_metric` type is strictly checked and converted to `undefined` when the selection is cleared up / an empty array is passed. \r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nRemove the loading indicator in select option menus when users are typing and (some) options are already loaded. The loading indicator showing up as users type was added in #16531, while tackling the issue of the inaccurate \"No data\" message when data is still loading. But we shouldn't show \"Loading...\" when there are already filtered options available. Removing this unnecessary loading indicator makes the control feels faster.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\nThe \"Loading...\" option shows up as soon as users type, even when all options are loaded:\r\n\r\n![before-select](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/154582570-4288f1c4-1a6a-4df5-bea6-402b12cc6afc.gif)\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\nNo \"Loading...\" option when users start to type, but there is a loading indicator in the input and all filtered options will show up after actual loading is finished:\r\n\r\n![acceptable-select](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/154582131-c9a925e3-059a-41e4-b65d-9e2b9ea6d696.gif)\r\n\r\nWhen all options are loaded for a specific search string, there is no loading indicator at all and no excessive requests will be fired.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Run `npm run storybook` in `superset-frontend`\r\n2. Test it in the storybook: http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/select--async-select\r\n     1. Try search for something in and not in the first page. E.g. \"ale\", \"sandro\"\r\n     2. \"No data\" should not show up if there is a match in loaded options or the next page is still loading\r\n     3. \"Loading...\" should not show up if there is already a matched option\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has

implementation of SIP-78\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis is the initial implementation of the features proposed in [SIP-78](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/17852), this pull request includes:\r\n* `advanced_data_type` field added to the TableColumn model, editable through the data source edit modal\r\n* Addition of the `api/v1/chart/advanced_data_type/convert` api [GET] endpoint used for converting user entered values into appropriate format\r\n* Addition of the `api/v1/chart/advanced_data_type/types` api [GET] used for retrieving list of registered advanced data types \r\n* `AdhocFilterEditPopoverSimpleTabContent` changes if a advanced data type is present on a column \r\n  - Populate filter available operator selection based on the current selected columns advanced data type if applicable via call to the conversion endpoint \r\n  - Valid subject based on rules of advanced data type, display a useful error message if an invalid value has been entered  and prevent saving \r\n  - Display converted value to the user via a tool tip\r\n * Addition of the Port and Internet Address advanced data types as examples \r\n * Modification of the sqla connector model to use advanced data type logic for converting  if a advanced data type is present on a column

What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n* set ENABLE_ADVANCED_DATA_TYPES feature flag to be true\r\n* add a `port` or `internet_address` advanced data type to an existing column through the data source editor\r\n* open the explore view on that that data source \r\n* add a filter on a column tagged with the advanced data type \r\n* enter a subject and verify that the converted value is displayed via a tool tip (i.e http will show up as 80 for the case of ports)\r\n* enter an invalid value and insure you cannot save and an error message is displayed\r\n* save a valid filter an a column tagged with a advanced data type and run the query\r\n* verify the query is as expected (i.e a filter with `ip_col, EQUALS, 1.1.1.1` should be `ip =16843009` in there where caluse ) \r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\nAdds support to multiple dependencies to the native filters. This will allow the user to create hierarchical and graph relationships among filters. The changes are the result of a series of interviews conducted by the design team with Superset users. Here's a summary of the changes:\r\n- Creates the \"Values are dependent on other filters\" section\r\n- Removes the \"Filters is hierarchical\" section\r\n- Adds indentation to the collapsable containers\r\n- Removes the hierarchical display of filters in the left panel of the modal\r\n- Adjusts the algorithm to validate circular dependencies on the fly\r\n- [Remove cascading popovers from filter bar](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/18790) @kgabryje\r\n- Effectively uses the [filter cards](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/18874) to display filter context\r\n- Adjusts RTL and Cypress the tests\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that major refactors are not in the scope at this stage. Our first objective is to deprecate FilterBox. We'll tackle code improvements in the next stage of the native filters revamp.\r\n\r\n@kasiazjc @jess-dillard\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70410625/155568831-ae7871b9-5c54-4060-beeb-11ac70978463.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nWe need to test the whole module. Apart from the basic tests, some important behaviors that should be checked:\r\n- When selecting \"Values are dependent on other filters\" a value is automatically suggested and this value does not generate a circular dependency warning if possible.\r\n- The circular dependency checking should occur on the fly while the user is selecting the filter dependencies.\r\n- If a filter is removed or has its type changed to one different than \"select\", all references to this filter should display \"(deleted or invalid filter)\". After saving and reopening the modal, that reference should disappear.\r\n- Only filters of type \"select\" should be available to be referenced as a dependency.\r\n- All filters in scope should be displayed on the filter bar independently of their relationships.\r\n- The values of a filter should be affected by its dependencies when applicable.\r\n- The filter card context is correctly displayed and text is truncated as expected. Please refer to #18874 to see the requirements.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration

addressed [18787](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/18787)\r\nThe issue concerns hive/spark-thriftserver as the processing engine.\r\nWhen a user runs a query on SQL Lab and later for any reason wants to stop it, it doesn't stop it on the hive/spark query engine.\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWhile debugging we figured that the state updated at [core.py](https://github.com/saurabh3091/superset/blob/f03b4dbedb29087c6958804aa803b5fb3200c7bb/superset/views/core.py#L2417) is not reflected at the [logic](https://github.com/saurabh3091/superset/blob/5805fb3cfbce632b8cda38e8bfa5650f19517ca1/superset/db_engine_specs/hive.py#L343) for canceling the job.\r\n\r\nSo we have added a small fix to update the session before it checks for the STOPPED status.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nAfter\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17564120/154525559-fcf390db-1435-40da-a1b3-d8b2d97fab2f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Run any query in SQL Lab with hive/spark-thriftserver as backend processing engine.\r\n2. Press STOP button on the UI.\r\n3. Check the query engine, the query will be stopped both on the frontend and backend.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\nFixes #18787 \r\n- [x] Has associated issue: [18787](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/18787)\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in
