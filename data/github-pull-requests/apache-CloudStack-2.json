PR: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/474\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the ability to create a new Instance from a VM backup for Dummy, NAS and Veeam backup Providers.\r\nThis will still work if the original Instance used to create the backup was expunged.\r\n\r\nNew API\r\n\r\n- createVmFromBackup extends deployVIrtualMachine\r\n- new argument : backupId\r\n- User can just specify the backupId and a new instance will be created by getting the VM and volumes' configuration stored in backup_details table.\r\n- User can also choose to configure the details themselves using the parameters present in deployVIrtualMachine cmd\r\n\r\nUI\r\n\r\n- New action button in backups list view - 'Create Instance from Backup'\r\n- User can choose to directly create the VM or configure VM parameters before creating it.\r\n\r\nDB changes\r\n\r\n- New backup_details table\r\n- to store vm config data such as templateUuid, serviceOfferingUuid, hypervisor, networkUuids\r\n- to store volumes config data such as diskOfferingUuids, size, miniops and maxiops for custom disk offerings.\r\n\r\nOther Changes\r\n\r\n- Added new parameter `Map datadisksdetails` to deployVirtualMachine api to create multiple data volumes at the time of instance creation.\r\n\r\nPlugins related changes\r\n\r\n- NAS and Veeam plugin changes to restore backup to a new VM.\r\n \r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In

update involves removing the traffic shaping functionality from the system. Previously, traffic shaping was being applied to control the flow of data across the network, but after careful consideration, it was determined that this mechanism was no longer necessary for the current system requirements.\r\n\r\nReason for Removing Traffic Shaping:\r\nThe decision to remove traffic shaping was based on the following factors:\r\n\r\nIneffective for Current Needs: Traffic shaping was not aligned with the present system's architecture, and it was causing unnecessary complexity without offering significant benefits to the network performance.\r\nPerformance Overhead: The traffic shaping process added unnecessary computational overhead, which negatively impacted the overall system performance. Removing it helps streamline the operations and reduces the load.\r\nShift in System Requirements: As the system evolved, the need for fine-tuned traffic management decreased. With the current configuration, it was concluded that other optimizations could handle the network traffic more efficiently.\r\nSimplification of Codebase: Removing traffic shaping simplifies the codebase, making it more maintainable and easier to troubleshoot in the future.\r\nBy removing this feature, we aim to improve performance and simplify the system, while ensuring that other network management mechanisms continue to function

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR main purpose is adding encryption support for Linstor, as Linstor handles the encryption layer (LUKS)\r\nto allow DRBD running on top of it, we needed a new mode for encryption in CloudStack.\r\nSo that CloudStack knows the volume is encrypted, but the encryption/deencryption is handled by the primary storage.\r\nSo qemu only gets the final block device path and opening/closing is handled by Linstor.\r\n\r\nAdditionally there are a few commits for cleanups and a few unittests for Linstor code.\r\nFor this to work at least Linstor 1.30.x is needed, as the new cloning code is needed.\r\n\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the `OwnershipSelection` component to VPC networks forms, allowing users to specify the account or project that will own the VPC.\r\n\r\nFixes: #10121\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd18364d-b34b-4ddb-8105-e1e3c47c9c13)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIn a local lab with the following domain structure:\r\n\r\nROOT\r\n  |- dom-A\r\n  |- dom-B\r\n     \\ - subdom-B\r\n\r\nWith a Root Admin account, I was able to create a VPC for a user in the ROOT, dom-A, dom-B and subdom-B domains. I validated that the account/project owner of the VPC was the one specified in the form, and not the caller account.\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\n\r\nWith ACS set to Brazilian Portuguese, the VPC was always created to the caller account. With the changes of PR #10052, this situation does not

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR  adds support to enable/disable VM High Availability manager. \r\n\r\n- New config 'vm.ha.enabled'  with Zone scope is added, to enable/disable VM High Availability manager. This is enable by default (for backward compatibilty). When enabled, the VM HA WorkItems (for VM Stop, Restart, Migration, Destroy) can be created and the scheduled items are executed. When disabled, new VM HA WorkItems are not allowed and the scheduled items are retried until max retries configured at 'vm.ha.migration.max.retries' (executed in case HA is re-enabled during retry attempts), and then purged after 'time.between.failures' by the cleanup thread that runs regularly at 'time.between.cleanup'.\r\n- New config 'vm.ha.alerts.enabled' with Zone scope is added, to enable/disable alerts for the VM HA operations. This is enabled by default.\r\n\r\nBoth these config settings can defined at zone/global level.\r\n\r\nDoc PR: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/464\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `listUsers` API response supports the `usersource` attribute, which represents the authentication source of users, such as `native`, `ldap`, `saml2` and `saml2disabled`.  However, it is neither possible to filter users by their authentication source nor to view this attribute in the users' list view.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR proposes to extend the `listUsers` API by introducing a new parameter called `usersource`, allowing callers to filter users by their authentication source. Furthermore, the UI has been enhanced to support this parameter in the search view and display the `usersource` attribute in the users' list view.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFixes #9932\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/891fee58-e59b-4bbe-ab8d-035b5ae7af4a)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b8495b6-18a9-4456-8dc3-a44439274546)\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n#### Through CloudMonkey\r\n- Verified that all users are listed when the `usersource` parameter is omitted.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\r\n<code>list users listall=true filter=account,username,usersource</code>\r\n</summary>\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n(localcloud) 🐹 > list users listall=true filter=account,username,usersource\r\n{\r\n  \"count\": 9,\r\n  \"user\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"account\": \"admin\",\r\n      \"username\": \"admin\",\r\n      \"usersource\": \"native\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"account\": \"baremetal-system-account\",\r\n      \"username\": \"baremetal-system-account\",\r\n      \"usersource\": \"native\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"account\": \"admin\",\r\n      \"username\": \"admin-kubeadmin\",\r\n      \"usersource\": \"native\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"account\": \"euler\",\r\n      \"username\": \"euler\",\r\n      \"usersource\": \"ldap\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"account\": \"tesla\",\r\n      \"username\": \"tesla\",\r\n      \"usersource\": \"ldap\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"account\": \"boyle\",\r\n      \"username\": \"boyle\",\r\n      \"usersource\": \"ldap\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"account\": \"gauss\",\r\n      \"username\": \"gauss\",\r\n      \"usersource\": \"ldap\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"account\": \"saml-u1\",\r\n      \"username\": \"saml-u1\",\r\n      \"usersource\": \"saml2\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"account\": \"saml-u2\",\r\n      \"username\": \"saml-u2\",\r\n      \"usersource\": \"saml2\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n- Verified that users are listed according to their source when the `usersource` parameter is specified. \r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\r\n<code>list users listall=true filter=account,username,usersource usersource=\"ldap\"</code>\r\n</summary>\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n(localcloud) 🐲 > list users listall=true filter=account,username,usersource usersource=\"ldap\"\r\n{\r\n  \"count\": 4,\r\n  \"user\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"account\": \"euler\",\r\n      \"username\": \"euler\",\r\n      \"usersource\": \"ldap\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"account\": \"tesla\",\r\n      \"username\": \"tesla\",\r\n      \"usersource\": \"ldap\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"account\": \"boyle\",\r\n      \"username\": \"boyle\",\r\n      \"usersource\": \"ldap\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"account\": \"gauss\",\r\n      \"username\": \"gauss\",\r\n      \"usersource\": \"ldap\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n- Verified that an error message is thrown when the `usersource` value is invalid.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\r\n<code>list users listall=true filter=account,username,usersource usersource=\"notValid\"</code>\r\n</summary>\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n(localcloud) 🐄 > list users listall=true filter=account,username,usersource usersource=\"notValid\"\r\n🙈 Error: (HTTP 431, error code 4350) Invalid user source: notValid.

Description\r\n\r\nThis improves the heartbeat check done from Linstor primary storage.\r\nIf a node doesn't have a DRBD connection to another node, additionally ask Linstor-Controller if the node is alive. Otherwise we would have simply said no and the node might still be alive. This is always the case in a non hyperconverged setup.\r\n\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, ACS provides a feature that enables a guest OS preference for a specific host, prioritizing VMs based on its OS. However, this functionality allows VMs with different OSes to be deployed in a host with a Guest OS defined, as expected as it is only a preference configuration; this is not always desired. For example, keeping proprietary OS in the same host could reduce licensing costs.\r\n\r\nThis PR tackles this scenario, allowing JavaScript rules, using the JS interpreter introduced in #5909, to direct VMs to specific hosts based on their OS. Different from the guest OS preference, these guest OS rules will be strict. This new feature added a new field, `Guest OS as JS rule` in the host edit view to allow users the creation of these rules.\r\n\r\nThis PR depends on #9074, for this reason it is on draft until #9074 is merged.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04365bf3-75b4-4e29-bdda-b60b67556493)\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIn a local lab with two hosts (`host-1` and `host-2`) I created the guest OS rule `vmGuestOs.toLowerCase().indexOf(\"debian\") != -1` for `host-2`, and deployed multiple VMs using templates and ISOs.\r\n\r\n- I deployed VMs with Ubuntu and CentOS and verify that `host-2` was filtered during the deployment.\r\n- I tried to migrate these VMs to `host-2` and verified that it was not possible.\r\n- I deployed a Debian VM and verified that both hosts were considered in the deployment process.\r\n- I managed to migrate this VM from `host-1` to `host-2` and vice versa.\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\n\r\nI tried to deploy VMs in the same lab without the guest OS rules defined and validated that the deployment of VMs were

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds information to the storage adapters if the `connectPhysicalDisk` is running while doing\r\nlive VM migration. At least for Linstor this information is very beneficial to only allow two-primaries while\r\nin this environment.\r\nOther storage adapters will currently just ignore this information.\r\n\r\nWe just found out by a recent incident that this is rather critical for Linstor in the case that\r\nfor some reason the CloudStack management server thinks that a host is down or needs to do\r\nVM HA, even tough the Host is still working as expected.\r\n\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR enables VR to allow outgoing traffic from Remote access VPN clients via CloudStack VR.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a draft. Ideally there is a global/account configuration, or new property of remote access VPN (similar as remote.access.vpn.client.iprange)\r\n\r\n\r\nRemote access vpn (setup by L2tp in CloudStack VR) does not support split tunneling. Where are two options when user connects to the RAV server\r\n- Do not use the VPN connection for the client. User has to manually add static route to the VMs on guest network.\r\n- Use the VPN connection for the client. All traffic will go through the RAV server (cloudstack VR). Currently, if uses choose this option, the RAV client will lose connection to the Internet.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the VM password to the vendor_data.json generated when ConfigDrive is used.\r\nThis way the ConfigDrive can be used as a full substitute for Virtual Router-based metadata servers, and it works with the ConfigDrive datasource of cloud-init.

PR fixes the traffic shaping issue for secondary NICs in VmwareTrafficLabel. Previously, traffic shaping was not applied correctly to secondary NICs, causing inconsistencies. This fix ensures that traffic limits and guarantees are properly enforced for both primary and secondary NICs, adhering to VMware's intended behavior.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\nFixed the traffic shaping functionality for secondary NICs in VmwareTrafficLabel.\r\nUpdated configurations to ensure traffic shaping is applied consistently across all NICs.\r\nTesting:\r\nVerified the fix by testing traffic

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses an issue when trying to assign an instance to another account/project when using ACS in another language besides English. To accomplish this fix, the `OwnershipSelection` component was standardized to use logic independent of the language used by the user.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [x] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nBefore this patch, the message `The new account is the same as the old account.` was shown when trying to assign the VM to another account/project.\r\n\r\nWith this patch, assigning an

secondary storages: sec1 and sec2\r\n- register the new 4.19.1 systemvm template for VMware (systemvm-vmware-4.19.1), but mistakely as a private template.\r\n- the systemvm template is downloaded to sec2 (not sec1). If it is downloaded to sec1, remove it and re-register the template.\r\n- backup the cloudstack databases by\r\n```\r\nmysqldump -R cloud -p >cloud.db\r\nmysqldump -R cloud_usage -p

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows config drive deletion of migrated VM, on host maintenance (from it's last source location - host cache/primary/secondary storage).\r\n\r\nFixes below issues identified during host maintenance tests, with VM using config drive on KVM host cache.\r\n\r\n1.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces support for cloudstack-agent on KVM on the s390x and cloudstack-management-server on s390x architecture.\r\nKVM is supported on s390x (IBM Z and LinuxONE) architecture, [Linux KVM Processor Support Page](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Processor_support#IBM_z).\r\nI have built a new s390x version of the System VM template: [ [Refer: s390x Build instructions and System VM Template guide.](https://github.com/linux-on-ibm-z/docs/wiki/Building-CloudStack)]\r\nI have tested the deployment of VMs and confirmed that the Virtual Router (VR), SSVM, Console Proxy functionalities worked as expected.\r\nTesting was performed with Debian 11 templates that are compatible with s390x in CloudStack.\r\nI have tested with agent and management server on the following distributions:\r\n- RHEL\r\n- Ubuntu\r\n- SLES\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to

Description\r\n\r\nAdds framework layer change to allow retrieving and storing IOPS stats for storage pools. Custom `PrimaryStoreDriver` can implement method - `getStorageIopsStats` for returning IOPS stats. Existing method `getUsedIops` can also be overridden by such plugins when only used IOPS is returned. For testing purpose, implementation has been added for simulator hypervisor plugin to return capacity and used IOPS for a pool. For local storage pool, implementation has been added using iostat to return currently used IOPS. StoragePoolResponse class has been updated to return IOPS values which allows showing IOPS values in UI for different storage pool related views and APIs.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ]

PR : https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/461\r\nThis PR fixes https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/8638\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nFour new Resource Types have been added. Admin can configure corresponding resource limits for the tenants at different levels (domain, account, project) \r\nUser dashboard's Storage section will show the new resources, their limits and current usage.\r\n\r\n1. backup - No. of backups used by the account\r\n2. backup_storage - Backup storage allocated for the account\r\n3. bucket - No. of buckets used by the accounts\r\n4. object_storage - Object storage allocated for the account.\r\n\r\nSome other related changes done to BnR framework:\r\n\r\n1. Maximum number of Backups to retain can be specified while creating Backup schedules, similar to Scheduled snapshots.\r\n2. Oldest Scheduled backup of the same interval type will be deleted once the number reaches the configured max Backups value.\r\n3. Code refactor: Moved syncBackups method from BackupProvider to the framework BackupManagerImpl, as it is a common functionality and all providers were using duplicated code.\r\n\r\nChanges done to the Object Storage Framework\r\n\r\n1. Quota parameter is made mandatory while creating a bucket. Bucket quota is considered to be the allocated space and will be used to enforce Resource limits.\r\n\r\n#### Schema Changes:\r\n\r\n1. New Column `max_backups` added to `backup_schedule` table\r\n4. New Column `backup_interval_type` added to `backups` table\r\n\r\n#### Api Changes:\r\n\r\n1. createBackup: new Parameter `scheduleid`. It should be specified whenever a scheduled backup is created. This will translate to the `backup_interval_type` in the `backups` table.\r\n3. createBackupScheduke: new Parameter `max_backups`. To specify maximum number of backups to retain for the given schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Configurations:\r\n|Setting |Scope |Default Value

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, in the VM deployment wizard, when the user tries to select a userdata by clicking on its row (outside the radio button), the userdata is not selected. This behavior also occurs for load balancer selection in the autoscale group creation form.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, whenever the `listUserData` API response doesn't contain the `params` attribute, the following exception is thrown in the browser's console:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'forEach')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses these issues by enabling users to select the VM's userdata and the autoscale group's load balancer by clicking on the corresponding resource table rows. Furthermore, the UI exception is now properly handled.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFixes #9990 and fixes #9991\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing

Description\r\n\r\nIf a user that is associated to a project gets deleted, other users become unable to see who belongs to the project via `listProjectAccounts` due to a NPE. This happens because the removed user is still associated with the project.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by removing the user from all projects before deleting it (as we already do with accounts). To normalize environments that are affected by the bug, the following script will be executed during the upgrade in order to delete project-user associations for users that were removed.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nDELETE FROM `cloud`.`project_account` WHERE `user_id` IN (SELECT `id` FROM `cloud`.`user` WHERE `removed`);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes #9974\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [X] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n#### User clean-up on deletion\r\n\r\n1.

With the changes, I was able to list them normally.\r\n\r\n#### Normalization of affected environments\r\n\r\nBefore applying the patch, I created some broken projects by deleting their users. Then, I executed the upgrade script and verified that I was able to list their accounts/users

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the following issues related to the Usage UI:\r\n- Usage metrics section is displayed with `null` values to users without access to the `listUsageServerMetrics` API (Fixes #9992);\r\n- Purge usage records action is displayed to users without access to the `removeRawUsageRecords` API (Fixes #9995);\r\n- Generate usage records action is displayed to users without access to the `generateUsageRecords` API (Fixes #9994);\r\n- Vertical scroll overflow in the usage records table (Fixes #9996);\r\n- Usage types input field is displayed to users without access to the `listUsageTypes` API. Since the `usageid` parameter of the `listUsageRecords` API can only be used alongside the `type` parameter, both form fields are now hidden when the caller does not have access to the `listUsageTypes` API.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n- Usage UI view when the user does not have access to the `listUsageServerMetrics`,  `removeRawUsageRecords`, `generateUsageRecords` and `listUsageTypes` APIs\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8387809-ca9d-45f5-b9ae-2f9bdc2c55cc)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, CloudStack does not support dual authentication methods for SAML users. If their source is equal to `SAML` or `SAMLDISABLED`, then they're not able to login with a username and password. However, when executing the `updateUser` API to update their password, the password is changed in the database, even though username/password authentication is unsupported for these users.\r\n\r\nRegarding LDAP users, password updates directly through CloudStack should also not be allowed. Therefore, this PR addresses these issues by providing a clear error message when SAML or LDAP users attempt to change their password via the `updateUser` API.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFixes #9933\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix

Tested?\r\n\r\n- Verified that attempting to update a SAML or LDAP user's password results in an appropriate error message.\r\n- Verified that attempting to update a `SAMLDISABLED` user's password also triggers the error message.\r\n- Verified that non-SAML/LDAP users can update their passwords without any

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the possibility to create wireguard VPNs as an alternative to the currently available L2TP-IPsec tunnels.\r\n\r\nChanges in details:\r\n- System VM template changes:\r\n  - Install Wireguard (leave it disabled)\r\n  - Add placeholder file /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf\r\n  - Add systemd service to restart wg-quick@wg0 if /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf is edited\r\n- DB changes: 2 new tables are introduced\r\n    - `wireguard_vpn `-> contains details on each tunnel (similar to the `remote_access_vpn` table)\r\n    - `wireguard_vpn_peer` -> contains details on each

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes adding a `tooltip` that displays the exact frequency (without rounding and described in MHz) of the `cpuspeed` and the `memory` value in MB to three decimal places on Hosts pages. Currently, the InfoCard component treats the CPU frequency to be displayed in GHz to two decimal places. The current way in which computing resources are displayed can mislead the end user.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to

Description\r\n\r\nWhen using the `cloudstack-setup-databases` command during the database setup process, some additional users are created. Since the standard procedure involves creating and configuring database users prior to the ACS setup, these extra users are not used. Moreover, the additional users created by `cloudstack-setup-databases` are granted excessive permissions, requiring operators to manually delete them.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new optional parameter, `--skip-users-auto-creation`. By using this parameter, ACS will skip the automatic creation of these additional users.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] Build/CI\r\n- [ ] Test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nAfter executing the `cloudstack-setup-databases` with the new flag, I checked the database users and, as expected, no new users were created. I then repeated the procedure without the new flag, and the extra users were created as usual.","created_at":"2024-11-25T16:41:26Z","updated_at":"2024-12-07T01:25:08Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"45c21d5663fcc6868135c7986f5ebdd92c69970e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2238703193,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjM4NzAzMTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/status:needs-testing","name":"status:needs-testing","color":"fc2d98","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/35","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/35","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/35/labels","id":11418179,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4ArjpD","number":35,"title":"4.21.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":150,"closed_issues":26,"state":"open","created_at":"2024-08-08T08:47:33Z","updated_at":"2025-02-07T11:58:25Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/9969/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/9969/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/9969/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/ce658e5058584c8d5d75b09e951369bd3a28d219","head":{"label":"scclouds:new-param-to-not-auto-create-db-users","ref":"new-param-to-not-auto-create-db-users","sha":"ce658e5058584c8d5d75b09e951369bd3a28d219","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds/cloudstack","description":"Apache

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, when all OAuth providers are disabled, the authentication page still displays the section divider below the login form.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this issue by ensuring the section divider is only rendered when at least one OAuth provider is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [X] Trivial\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n####

enabled, both the section divider and the OAuth provider sign-in options are rendered correctly.\r\n- Verified that when all OAuth providers are disabled, the section divider is no longer displayed.","created_at":"2024-11-24T23:44:23Z","updated_at":"2024-11-28T17:34:58Z","closed_at":"2024-11-28T16:45:20Z","merged_at":"2024-11-28T16:45:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"c56fc7f81c762a8ecdec2e445ed3d9a2c7b73337","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"harikrishna-patnala","id":3348673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3348673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala","html_url":"https://github.com/harikrishna-patnala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":739374767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzkzNzQ3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:UI","name":"component:UI","color":"ea62a8","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/33","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/33","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/33/labels","id":11200547,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4Aqugj","number":33,"title":"4.19.2","description":"minor

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `listNetworkOfferings` API supports the `forvpc` and `guestiptype` parameters (see [API docs](https://cloudstack.apache.org/api/apidocs-4.19/apis/listNetworkOfferings.html)). The first is used to filter network offerings that can only be used for creating VPC tiers; the second allows filtering by guest network type (available options are: `Isolated`, `Shared` and `L2`).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support to these parameters in the UI. The `forvpc` filter has been added as a normal filter (declared in the `filters` property of the network offerings section's object) and the `guestiptype` as a search filter (declared in the `searchFilters` property).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this PR also fixes a bug that caused duplicate options to appear in search filter lists.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFixes #9924\r\n\r\n### Types of

How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n### `forvpc` filter tests\r\n\r\n- I checked that when selecting `VPC` on the section's filter, a request to `listNetworkOfferings` was sent, with the `forvpc` parameter set to `true`.\r\n- I checked that when selecting `Guest Network` on the section's filter, a request to `listNetworkOfferings` was sent, with the `forvpc` parameter set to `false`.\r\n- I checked that when selecting `All` on the section's filter, a request to `listNetworkOfferings` was sent, without the `forvpc` parameter.\r\n\r\n### `guestiptype` filter tests\r\n\r\n- I checked that when selecting the `Isolated` option on the `Guest Type` search filter, a request to `listNetworkOfferings` was sent, with the `guestiptype` parameter set to `Isolated`.\r\n- I checked that when selecting the `Shared` option on the `Guest Type` search filter, a request to `listNetworkOfferings` was sent, with the `guestiptype` parameter set to `Shared`.\r\n- I checked that when selecting the `L2` option on the `Guest Type` search filter, a request to `listNetworkOfferings` was sent, with the `guestiptype` parameter set to `L2`.\r\n\r\n### Duplicate options in search filter

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, to add a user or account to a project through UI, a select input field is rendered, displaying the accounts and users that the caller has access to as options. As a result, users with an account of the `User` type are unable to add other accounts or users to a project, since they don't have access to other accounts or users and no options are available to be selected in the input field.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the input field to allow users to both select from the available options and manually enter the account name or username they wish to add to the project.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFixes #9774\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n#### Adding an account by selecting an option available in the dropdown\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/364ee224-fe4f-48da-a1ae-aa3e25c4bb8b)\r\n\r\n#### Adding a user by entering their username in the input field\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/574f79f1-8d67-49fd-8f2a-f2cb4109e061)\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n1. I created a domain `d1`, a domain admin (`d1`) and two normal users (`u1-d1` and `u2-d1`) belonging to the domain.\r\n2. I created a project with the `d1` account.\r\n3. I verified that the `d1` account can select accounts and users of their domain to add them to the project.\r\n4. I added the `u1-d1` account to the project as an admin.\r\n5. I logged in with the `u1-d1` account, accessed the project and added the user `u2-d1` to the project.\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-14T11:52:13Z","updated_at":"2024-11-28T17:34:19Z","closed_at":"2024-11-28T17:33:47Z","merged_at":"2024-11-28T17:33:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"b6937b6a51aadebb00a68dd65b17b924c6681a41","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"weizhouapache","id":57355700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzU1NzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57355700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache","html_url":"https://github.com/weizhouapache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":739374767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzkzNzQ3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:UI","name":"component:UI","color":"ea62a8","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/33","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/33","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/33/labels","id":11200547,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4Aqugj","number":33,"title":"4.19.2","description":"minor

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a regression introduced in 4.19.1.0 in the `listServiceOfferings` API.\r\n\r\nThe API's query was being built with an AND where there previously was an OR. This regression caused the API to not return the expected offerings, breaking the dynamic scale of instances via the UI (#9879).\r\n\r\nFixes: #9879\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n- [ ] test (unit or integration test code)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n1. I tried listing the service offering for a virtual machine with dynamic scale enabled that uses a custom constrained offering via CMK, and verified the performed query.\r\n\r\na) Before the regression, the following query would be performed:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT service_offering_view.id, service_offering_view.uuid, service_offering_view.name, service_offering_view.display_text, service_offering_view.provisioning_type, service_offering_view.tags, service_offering_view.use_local_storage, service_offering_view.system_use, service_offering_view.cpu, service_offering_view.speed, service_offering_view.ram_size, service_offering_view.nw_rate, service_offering_view.mc_rate, service_offering_view.ha_enabled, service_offering_view.limit_cpu_use, service_offering_view.is_volatile, service_offering_view.host_tag, service_offering_view.default_use, service_offering_view.vm_type, service_offering_view.customized_iops, service_offering_view.min_iops, service_offering_view.max_iops, service_offering_view.hv_ss_reserve, service_offering_view.sort_key, service_offering_view.bytes_read_rate, service_offering_view.bytes_read_rate_max, service_offering_view.bytes_read_rate_max_length, service_offering_view.bytes_write_rate, service_offering_view.bytes_write_rate_max, service_offering_view.bytes_write_rate_max_length, service_offering_view.iops_read_rate, service_offering_view.iops_read_rate_max, service_offering_view.iops_read_rate_max_length, service_offering_view.iops_write_rate, service_offering_view.iops_write_rate_max, service_offering_view.iops_write_rate_max_length, service_offering_view.created, service_offering_view.removed, service_offering_view.domain_id, service_offering_view.domain_uuid, service_offering_view.domain_name, service_offering_view.domain_path, service_offering_view.zone_id, service_offering_view.zone_uuid, service_offering_view.zone_name, service_offering_view.deployment_planner, service_offering_view.cache_mode, service_offering_view.min_cpu, service_offering_view.max_cpu, service_offering_view.min_memory, service_offering_view.max_memory, service_offering_view.vsphere_storage_policy, service_offering_view.root_disk_size, service_offering_view.dynamic_scaling_enabled, service_offering_view.disk_offering_strictness, service_offering_view.disk_offering_id, service_offering_view.disk_offering_uuid, service_offering_view.disk_offering_name, service_offering_view.disk_offering_display_text, service_offering_view.encrypt_root FROM service_offering_view WHERE service_offering_view.disk_offering_strictness = 0  AND service_offering_view.use_local_storage = 0  AND  ( (service_offering_view.cpu >= 1 )  OR  (service_offering_view.cpu IS NULL  AND service_offering_view.max_cpu IS NULL )  OR  (service_offering_view.cpu IS NULL  AND service_offering_view.max_cpu >= 1 ) )  AND  (service_offering_view.speed >= 1024  OR service_offering_view.speed IS NULL )  AND  ( (service_offering_view.ram_size >= 1024 )  OR  (service_offering_view.ram_size IS NULL  AND service_offering_view.max_memory IS NULL )  OR  (service_offering_view.ram_size IS NULL  AND service_offering_view.max_memory >= 1024 ) )  AND service_offering_view.dynamic_scaling_enabled = 1  AND service_offering_view.system_use = 0  AND service_offering_view.removed IS NULL  ORDER BY service_offering_view.sort_key ASC , service_offering_view.id ASC  LIMIT 0, 500\r\n```\r\n\r\nOriginally, the section that got regressed was:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n(service_offering_view.ram_size IS NULL  AND service_offering_view.max_memory IS NULL )  OR  (service_offering_view.ram_size IS NULL  AND service_offering_view.max_memory >= 1024 )\r\n```\r\n\r\nb) With the regression, the following query is performed:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT DISTINCT(service_offering.id) FROM service_offering  LEFT JOIN service_offering_details maxComputeDetailsSearch ON service_offering.id=maxComputeDetailsSearch.service_offering_id AND 'maxcpunumber'=maxComputeDetailsSearch.name  LEFT JOIN service_offering_details maxMemoryDetailsSearch ON service_offering.id=maxMemoryDetailsSearch.service_offering_id AND 'maxmemory'=maxMemoryDetailsSearch.name  INNER JOIN disk_offering diskOfferingSearch ON

NULL  AND maxMemoryDetailsSearch.value >= 1024  )\r\n```\r\n\r\nc) With the patch:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT DISTINCT(service_offering.id) FROM service_offering  LEFT JOIN service_offering_details maxComputeDetailsSearch ON service_offering.id=maxComputeDetailsSearch.service_offering_id AND 'maxcpunumber'=maxComputeDetailsSearch.name  LEFT JOIN service_offering_details maxMemoryDetailsSearch ON

service_offering.sort_key ASC , service_offering.id ASC  LIMIT 0, 500\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second AND was reverted to an OR:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n( service_offering.ram_size IS NULL  AND  ( maxMemoryDetailsSearch.value IS NULL  OR maxMemoryDetailsSearch.value >= 1024  )  )\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Via the UI, I tried to dynamic scale the VM, and verified that I was able to scale it successfully.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-11-05

Local storage vm\r\n2. HA vm\r\n3. Local storage vm with ha data disk\r\n4. ha vm with ha datadisk\r\n5. Local storage vm with local data disk\r\n6. ha vm with local datadisk\r\n\r\n5 and 6 result in an ErrorInMaintenance due to dest being null. Similar as described in https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/9887. Without this patch these would still fail with the same error as described in actual behavior.\r\n\r\nAfter creation of a ha vm with ha data disk maintenance was not possible. After manual migration to another host and back, migration did complete. Migration without selecting host also gave a no destination found error and also occurred without this patch so is unrelated.\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes some inconsistencies which results in Usage generating usage records when it should not, namely:\r\n\r\n- Duplicated entries in the networks helper table, resulting in duplicated usage record generation;\r\n- Port forwarding helper entries are never removed, resulting in removed port forwarding rules generating usage records;\r\n- Load balancer helper entries are never removed, resulting in removed load balancer rules generating usage records;\r\n- VM snapshot helper entries are never removed, resulting in removed VM snapshots generating usage records;\r\n- Helper entries for volumes in the secondary storage are never removed after the volume gets attached to a VM, resulting in secondary storage usage records being generated for volumes that are not in the secondary storage anymore.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [X] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n#### Duplicated usage record generation for networks\r\n\r\n1. I created a network\r\n2. I added a VM to the network\r\n3. I stopped the VM\r\n4. I waited until the network reverted to `Allocated`\r\n5. I started the VM\r\n6. I ran the Usage job\r\n\r\nBefore the changes, after the Usage job finishes, there would be two non-removed helper entries for the same network, resulting in duplicated usage records being generated for the network. After the changes, the first helper entry was marked as removed.\r\n\r\n#### Removed port forwarding rules generating usage records\r\n\r\n1. I created a port forwarding rule\r\n2. I ran the Usage job in order to create a helper entry for the PF rule\r\n3. I verified, in `cloud_usage.usage_port_forwarding`, that the helper entry had an ID different from the PF rule's ID\r\n4. I deleted the PF rule\r\n5. I ran the Usage job\r\n\r\nBefore the changes, the helper entry would not get marked as removed in step 5, resulting in usage records still being generated for the removed PF rule. After the changes, the helper entry got marked as removed.\r\n\r\n#### Removed load balancer policies generating usage records\r\n\r\n1. I created a load balancer policy\r\n2. I ran the Usage job in order to create a helper entry for the LB policy\r\n3. I verified, in `cloud_usage.usage_load_balancer_policy`, that the helper entry had an ID different from the LB policy's ID\r\n4. I deleted the LB policy\r\n5. I ran the Usage job\r\n\r\nBefore the changes, the helper entry would not get marked as removed in step 5, resulting in usage records still being generated for the removed LB policy. After the changes, the helper entry got marked as removed.\r\n\r\n#### Removed VM snapshots generating usage records\r\n\r\n1. I took two VM snapshots of the same VM\r\n2. I ran the Usage job in order to create helper entries for the two VM snapshots\r\n3. I verified, in `cloud_usage.usage_snapshot_on_primary`, that the helper entry had IDs different from the VM's ID\r\n4. I removed the two VM snapshots\r\n5. I ran the Usage job\r\n\r\nBefore the changes, the helper entries would not get marked as removed in step 5, resulting in usage records still being generated for the removed VM snapshots. After the changes, the helper entries got marked as removed.\r\n\r\n#### Volumes in the secondary storage that were attached still generate usage records\r\n\r\n1. I uploaded a volume\r\n2. I ran the Usage job in order to create a secondary storage helper entry for the volume \r\n3. I verified, in `cloud_usage.usage_storage`, that the helper entry had had an ID different from the volume's ID\r\n4. I attached the volume to a VM\r\n5. I ran the Usage job\r\n\r\nBefore the changes, a helper entry would be created to generate secondary storage usage records for the volume (in `cloud_usage.usage_storage`). After attaching, another entry would be created to generate primary storage volume usage records; however, the secondary storage helper entry did not get removed, resulting in secondary storage usage records being generated for a volume that was not in the secondary storage anymore.\r\n\r\nAfter the changes, the secondary storage helper entry was marked as

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, the configuration `vmsnapshot.max` isn't dynamic, and it is necessary to restart the Management Server after changing the configuration's value.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to change the `vmsnapshot.max` config to the new `ConfigKey` standard for dynamic configurations.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing

performed the following steps without restarting the Management Server:\r\n\r\n1. Changed the `vmsnapshot.max` value to 2;\r\n2. Tried to take 3 VM snapshots, but as expected, an exception was thrown on the 3rd snapshot;\r\n3. Changed the `vmsnapshot.max` value to 3;\r\n4.
