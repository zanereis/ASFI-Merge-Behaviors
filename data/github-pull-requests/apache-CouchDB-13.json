Overview\r\nMove some configuration options from `[httpd]` to `[chttpd]`.\r\nThe options are kept in [httpd]: `port`, `bind_address`, `authentication_handlers`, `server_options` and `socket_options`.\r\nSince users have local settings, we cannot just move all options directly to `[chttpd]`.\r\n`chttpd_util: get_chttpd_config()` will first check `[chttpd]`, if it is not defined, it will check `[httpd]`, and then, if it is not defined, it will return the `Default` value.\r\n\r\nI will add a documentation PR after when I finished moving options from `[couch_httpd_auth]` to `[chttpd_auth]`.\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\nmake eunit apps=chttpd

`buggify-elixir-suite` target to run Elixir integration tests under FoundationDB's client buggify mode [1]. In this mode, the FDB C client in the `erlfdb` application will periodically throw mostly retryable errors (`1009`, `1007`, etc). Transaction closures should properly handle retryable errors without side-effects such as re-sending response data to the user more than once or, attempt to re-read data from the socket after it was already read once.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid false positives, provide a custom .ini settings file which disables transaction timeouts (`1031` errors). Those are not retryable by default, as far as the `on_error` callback is concerned. If we do have timeouts set ( = 60000), it signals to the FoundationDB client that we expect to handle timeouts in buggify mode, so it starts throwing them [2]. Since we don't handle those everywhere we get quite a few false positive errors.\r\n\r\nBuggify settings I believe are the default -- 25% chance to activate an error, and 25% chance of firing the error when the code passes over that section.

Overview\r\nCouch_prometheus's additional http server should be off by default\r\nand the port should have a default value of 17986 when running\r\n\r\n`make release`.  The http server was mistakenly left on without a port\r\nand that led to startup issues.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`make release` should install correctly after running `configure`.\r\nI performed the above step and the `default.ini` in `rel/couchdb` shows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[prometheus]\r\nadditional_port = false\r\nbind_address = 127.0.0.1\r\nport =

we deleted the ets handle cache, then bumped the FDB metadata. That has a race condition if anything else, like `fabric2_indexing` or other `couch_jobs` users, tried to get a `jtx()` handle before the metadata bump. In that\r\ncase, they would have re-inserted a handle with a stale `md_version` and the test assertions would fail.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to first bump the md version, then delete the

are 2 commits:\r\n\r\n1. After recent improvements to how retries are handled in `fabric2_fdb`, Elixir\r\n integration tests can often pass when running under \"buggify\" mode. The chance \r\nof re-sending response data during retries is now much lower, too. However,\r\nthere are still some instances of that type of failure when running `_all_dbs`\r\ntests. To trigger it would have to run the all_dbs test from basics_tests.exs a\r\nfew thousands times in a row. The reason for the failure is that retryable\r\nerrors might be still thrown during the `LayerPrefix = get_dir(Tx)` call, and\r\nthe whole transaction closure would be retried in [2]. When that happens,\r\nuser's callback is called twice with `meta` and it sends `[` twice in a row to\r\nthe client [3], which is incorrect.\r\n   A simple fix is to not call `meta` or `complete` from the transaction context.\r\nThat works because we don't pass the transaction object into user's callback\r\nand the user won't be able to run another transaction in the same process\r\nanyway.\r\n  There are already tests which test retryable errors in _all_dbs and _dbs_info,\r\nbut they had been updated to only throw retryable errors when rows are emitted\r\nto match the new behavior.\r\n\r\n2. When running integration tests with a \"buggified\" client, sometimes\r\n`fold_range_not_progressing` is triggered since it's possible retriable errors\r\nmight be thrown 3 times in a row. Instead of bumping it arbitrarily, since we\r\nalready have a retry limit in fabric2_server, start using that.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-26T20:45:51Z","updated_at":"2021-04-27T18:32:18Z","closed_at":"2021-04-27T18:32:15Z","merged_at":"2021-04-27T18:32:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"ff2242c5f90fd307eb5df52bc09952b1e580e3f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3530/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3530/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3530/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/2d574b070ae03b4736c1cdb5b2af42e1041034bb","head":{"label":"apache:improve-retry-handling-in-dbs-endpoints","ref":"improve-retry-handling-in-dbs-endpoints","sha":"2d574b070ae03b4736c1cdb5b2af42e1041034bb","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

AIMD-based batching to `couch_jobs` activity monitor and notifier\r\n\r\n`couch_jobs` activity monitor is responsible for checking jobs which have not\r\nbeen updated often enough by their workers and re-enqueuing them. Previously\r\nwhen the number of jobs grew high enough, `couch_jobs` could fail to either\r\niterate through all the jobs and timeout with a 1007, try to re-enqueue too\r\nmany jobs such that the sum of the commit data would end up being larger than\r\nthe 10MB FDB limit.\r\n\r\n`couch_jobs` notifier is in charge notifying subscribers when job state changes.\r\nIf the jobs are updated, it would notify if it noticed updates, otherwise it\r\nwould notify if job switch to a new state (`running` -> `pending`, `running` ->\r\n`finished`, etc). Previously, if there were too many jobs and/or the cluster was\r\noverloaded it was possible for the notifier to fail with timeouts.\r\n\r\nTo fix both issues, introduce batching with the batch size dynamically\r\nadjusted based on load. As more consecutive errors occur the batch will shrink\r\nexponentially down to 1 row per transaction. Then with each success, the batch\r\nwill grow linearly by a fixed amount. This auto-configurable behavior should\r\nprovide optimal behavior during overload and during normal operating\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nFor tests, since there are already tests which test enqueuing and subscription,\r\nuse the same tests but make sure they are run while errors are periodically\r\ngenerated. That's accomplished with the help of `meck:loop/1` return\r\nspecification.\r\n\r\nThere are two more commits in the PR to fix and update the `next_vs/1` function and\r\nanother one to simplify handling retryable errors in `couch_jobs`.","created_at":"2021-04-22T18:02:16Z","updated_at":"2021-04-23T18:28:45Z","closed_at":"2021-04-22T20:16:17Z","merged_at":"2021-04-22T20:16:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"bdb38184e252dbd390bccb75d18db536d9240acd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3524/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3524/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3524/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/33ed17df5d1f054bc3599bb9b18fcb557b8ff2c3","head":{"label":"apache:add-batching-to-couch-jobs","ref":"add-batching-to-couch-jobs","sha":"33ed17df5d1f054bc3599bb9b18fcb557b8ff2c3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

continues improvements to retryable error handling started in https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3460. Here we add the same logic we already have for the `erlfdb:wait/2` call in [loop function](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/main/src/couch_jobs/src/couch_jobs_type_monitor.erl#L55-L57)  to the `get_vs_and_watch/1` section.\r\n\r\n`couch_jobs_type_monitor` is meant to be linked to and run in a continuous loop as long as the parent process is alive. If FDB becomes unavailable the main process which we linked to or other main component (the whole application) should crash and fail as opposed to the type monitor itself. Still, to avoid running in a tight loop we use the holdoff interval to sleep a bit before recursing. The typical values of the holdoff is around 50-100 msec.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-06T14:28:28Z","updated_at":"2021-04-06T15:44:20Z","closed_at":"2021-04-06T15:44:17Z","merged_at":"2021-04-06T15:44:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"7a6ea6545338f942ecf9fb590d5372b73867e0b9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3494/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3494/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3494/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/ca355ebaf9d8fa8afbc2da56b0ccee2e29964f13","head":{"label":"apache:fix-retry-handling-in-jobs-type-monitor","ref":"fix-retry-handling-in-jobs-type-monitor","sha":"ca355ebaf9d8fa8afbc2da56b0ccee2e29964f13","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Overview\r\n\r\nThis is a port of https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3485 to 3.x\r\n\r\nDo not log by default potentially long list of messages received by terminated process. Currently we log `messages` field in the termination report. This means that we try to process whole message queue of a process before we write the log entry.\r\nAn example of a log message we are trying to reduce is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJan 13 20:18:22 c-fdbcore-perf-api-546dc8d4d8-6hx5n db error [error] 2021-01-13T20:18:22.322515Z dbcore@172.30.74.10 <0.381.0> -------- CRASH REPORT Process fabric2_txids (<0.381.0>) with 0 neighbors exited with reason: {bad_info,{#Ref<0.3875778607.1050673154.132562>,ready}} at gen_server:handle_common_reply/8(line:726) <= proc_lib:init_p_do_apply/3(line:247); initial_call: {fabric2_txids,init,['Argument__1']}, ancestors: [fabric2_sup,<0.377.0>], message_queue_len: 1, messages: [{'$gen_cast',{remove,<<21,22,21,255,22,6,74,23,8,...>>}}], links: [<0.378.0>], dictionary: [{fdb_directory,[<<\"perf\">>]},{'$erlfdb_error',undefined},{'$fabric_db_handle',...}], trap_exit: false, status: running, heap_size: 6772, stack_size: 27, reductions: 348809\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThe regular `make check` should work. To run tests selectively you can use:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake eunit apps=couch_log tests=couch_log_config_test_\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to those issues or pull requests here.  -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [x] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in https://github.com/apache/couchdb-documentation\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-01T18:13:34Z","updated_at":"2021-04-01T21:18:00Z","closed_at":"2021-04-01T21:17:56Z","merged_at":"2021-04-01T21:17:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"96b782baf9bfd8278b5bde9c3b4724227ae33e82","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3489/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3489/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3489/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/01448025e773d2911ee1020a3e132007d5acb662","head":{"label":"cloudant:configurable_filter_fields","ref":"configurable_filter_fields","sha":"01448025e773d2911ee1020a3e132007d5acb662","user":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39005786,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTAwNTc4Ng==","name":"couchdb","full_name":"cloudant/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant/couchdb","description":"Mirror

This means that we try to process whole message queue of a process before we write the log entry.\r\nAn example of a log message we are trying to reduce is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJan 13 20:18:22 c-fdbcore-perf-api-546dc8d4d8-6hx5n db error [error] 2021-01-13T20:18:22.322515Z dbcore@172.30.74.10 <0.381.0> -------- CRASH REPORT Process fabric2_txids (<0.381.0>) with 0 neighbors exited with reason: {bad_info,{#Ref<0.3875778607.1050673154.132562>,ready}} at gen_server:handle_common_reply/8(line:726) <= proc_lib:init_p_do_apply/3(line:247); initial_call: {fabric2_txids,init,['Argument__1']}, ancestors: [fabric2_sup,<0.377.0>], message_queue_len: 1, messages: [{'$gen_cast',{remove,<<21,22,21,255,22,6,74,23,8,...>>}}], links: [<0.378.0>], dictionary: [{fdb_directory,[<<\"perf\">>]},{'$erlfdb_error',undefined},{'$fabric_db_handle',...}], trap_exit: false, status: running, heap_size: 6772, stack_size: 27, reductions: 348809\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThe regular `make check` should work. To run tests selectively you can use:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake eunit apps=couch_log tests=couch_log_config_test_\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [x] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation

Overview\r\n\r\nWe've noticed that http client in some cases getting a stacktrace. This problem\r\ncan be reproduced when shard files are truncated and user try to call `/_all_docs`.\r\nThe depth of the stack trace was not sufficient to uncover that the error is\r\ncoming from\r\n[`couch_mrview:all_docs_fold/4`](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/3.x/src/couch_mrview/src/couch_mrview.erl#L383)\r\n\r\nWe've made a hypothesis that we are getting an `EXIT` whenever we call a\r\n`gen_server` from the request process.\r\n\r\nAs a confirmation of this hypothesis there was an error logged from\r\n[`rexi_server:init_p/3`](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/3.x/src/rexi/src/rexi_server.erl#L144).\r\n\r\n```\r\n[error] 2021-01-28T17:06:16.357719Z node1@127.0.0.1 <0.2558.0> f674d6062d rexi_server:\r\n   from: node1@127.0.0.1(<0.2485.0>)\r\n   mfa: fabric_rpc:all_docs/3\r\n   error:\r\n   {{badmatch,{'EXIT',{{badmatch,eof},[\r\n       {couch_file,read_raw_iolist_int,3,[{file,\"src/couch_file.erl\"},{line,713}]},\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `rexi_server` is just one of such places. There might be other places as well.\r\nEven if we would find all such cases in the code base and add special handling to\r\nunwrap the error to remove `EXIT`. It will not solve the problem because calls\r\nto `gen_server` can be done in EPI plugin.\r\n\r\nTherefore it is better to handle in one place in `chttpd:error_info/1`.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: @janosgyerman\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n1. create database\r\n2. add few documents\r\n3. truncate all shards of a database\r\n4. issue `/_all_docs` request\r\n5. verify that error response doesn't include the stacktrace\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3363\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works

Overview\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces a handful of related improvements to the code that chooses the FoundationDB cluster file. We now check for a cluster file in up to 4 locations, in priority order:\r\n\r\n1. The value of `[erlfdb] cluster_file` in the server config\r\n2. The value of the FDB_CLUSTER_FILE environment variable\r\n3. /usr/local/etc/foundationdb/fdb.cluster (MacOS package default)\r\n4. /etc/foundationdb/fdb.cluster (Linux packages default)\r\n\r\nThe second and fourth locations are new. We also check that the file has appropriate access permissions, namely that is RW accessible by the user running CouchDB. Finally, we add some more detailed logging to help users debug any problems in this department on startup.\r\n\r\nIf a location is specified using either one of the first two \"custom\" approaches and there is a problem with that location, CouchDB will abort rather than try any further option. This avoids a situation where a user intended to override the default cluster file but CouchDB starts up with the default one because e.g. the user failed to actually install the new file with the correct permissions.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nStill need to add a test suite here, and really some documentation too (although that would probably be a larger project involving documentation of the 4.0 stack as a whole). I could use a bit of guidance on the testing. Should I just verify the behavior of `find_cluster_file/1` with a mix of valid and invalid input? Is it better to create fixtures with bad permissions or just mock `file:read_file_info/2`?\r\n\r\nI've tested several aspects of this manually:\r\n- [x] ~~checked that a custom cluster file with bad permissions causes a crash~~ (logging a warning instead now)\r\n- [x] checked that FDB_CLUSTER_FILE can be used instead of the server config setting\r\n- [x] checked that CouchDB will find /etc/foundationdb/fdb.cluster without any config help\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Overview\r\n\r\nIn testing I've found that it would be much easier if max_dbs_open defines the maximum number of .couch files on a per couch_server basis (now that we have sharded the workload over several such processes). A few reasons that come into play;\r\n\r\n1. In many test setups, including some couchdb tests in this repo, we set max_dbs_open quite low. The runtime division of that value by the number of schedulers then causes tests to fail in a confusing way. Performance tests are particularly impacted.\r\n2. It is surprising to find that a config setting is not honored directly.\r\n3. max_dbs_open itself exists to address two concerns. Firstly, as a cap on the number of open files directly. Secondly, to reflect the prohibitive cost of updating the server state for very large numbers of entries. For the first item, for small systems, the number of cores will also be small, so the multiplying effect of this change should not be a concern. For the second item, max_dbs_open's new definition is a significant improvement, as it can be set to whatever an individual couch_server can handle in terms of updating the server state.\r\n\r\n##

is the cherry pick of the already approved PR on 3.x: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3433\r\n\r\nStarting with OTP 21 there is a new logging system, and we forgot to\r\nadd the legacy error logger handler for it. Without it `couch_log`\r\ncannot emit gen_server, supervisor and other such system events.\r\n\r\nLuckily, there is OTP support to enable legacy error_logger behavior and\r\nthat's what we're doing here. The `add_report_handler/1` call will\r\nauto-start the `error_logger` app if needed, and it will also add an\r\n`error_logger` handler to the global `logger` system.\r\n\r\nWe also keep the `gen_event:add_sup_handler/3` call, as that will\r\nensure we'll find out when `error_logger` dies so that\r\n`couch_log_monitor` can restart everything.\r\n\r\nSomeday(TM) we'll write a proper log event handler for the new logger\r\nand have nicely formatted structured logs, but it's better to do that\r\nonce we don't have to support OTP versions =< 20.\r\n\r\nIssue:

with OTP 21 there is a new logging system, and we forgot to add the legacy error logger handler for it. Without it, `couch_log` cannot emit gen_server, supervisor and other such system events.\r\n\r\nLuckily, there is OTP support to enable legacy error_logger behavior and that's what we're doing here. The `add_report_handler/1` call will auto-start the `error_logger` app if needed, and it will also add an `error_logger` handler to the global `logger` system.\r\n\r\nWe also keep the `gen_event:add_sup_handler/3` call, as that will ensure we'll find out when `error_logger` dies so that\r\n`couch_log_monitor` can restart everything.\r\n\r\nSomeday(TM) we'll write a proper log event handler for the new logger and have nicely formatted structured logs, but it's better to do that once we don't have to support OTP versions =< 20.\r\n\r\nIssue: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3422\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nBuild with Erlang/OTP >= 21, then start a dev/run cluster, tail the log and and remsh in.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>  exit(whereis(couch_replicator_scheduler), bam).\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe logs should show something like:\r\n```\r\nSupervisor couch_replicator_sup had child couch_replicator_scheduler started with

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThe last few builds ([83](https://ci-couchdb.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/jenkins-cm1%2FFullPlatformMatrix/detail/main/83/pipeline/) and [84](https://ci-couchdb.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/jenkins-cm1%2FFullPlatformMatrix/detail/main/84/pipeline/)) were failing with `AssertionError`s that I assume are due to some race.

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nAll `mix test` runs were starting with\r\n```\r\nCannot configure base applications: [:kernel]\r\n\r\nThese applications are already started by the time the configuration\r\nexecutes and these configurations have no effect.\r\n\r\nIf you want to configure these applications for a release, you can\r\nspecify them in your vm.args file:\r\n\r\n    -kernel config_key config_value\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you must configure them dynamically, you can wrap\r\nthem in a conditional block in your config files:\r\n\r\n    if System.get_env(\"RELEASE_MODE\") do\r\n      config :kernel, ...\r\n    end\r\n\r\nand then configure your releases to reboot after configuration:\r\n\r\n    releases: [\r\n      my_app: [reboot_system_after_config: true]\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nThis happened when loading config/config.exs or\r\none of its imports.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI haven't been able to find references to `Mix.Config`'s `error_logger` in `kernel` so I've opened this PR to remove it.\r\nI understand this is probably a [Chesterton's fence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#Chesterton's_fence) so I'm okay with keeping it, but I'd prefer this PR be `-1`d with a reference to why those lines need to stay.\r\n+CC @iilyak (`git blame` tells me it was introduced in d427f353ab4be03998685f6a167d9559c7b50a76 ).\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe

turns out fabric is dependent on couch_jobs because of db expiration module.\r\nSo when couch_jobs was restarted multiple times per test case it could have\r\nbrought down fabric. However, since couch_jobs needs fabric for transactional\r\nstuff it ended up brining couch_jobs app down as well.\r\n\r\nTo fix it:\r\n\r\n * Switch to explicitly starting/stopping fabric and couch_jobs together\r\n\r\n * Break apart bad_messages* tests to individually test each type of message\r\n   as app restarts in the middle of the tests kept killing fabric and\r\n   intermittently killing couch_jobs a well.\r\n\r\n * Also make the tests look nicer by re-using ?TDEF_FE macros from\r\n   `fabric2_test`, this we can avoid the `?_test(begin... end).` pattern.\r\n\r\n * Remove `meck:unload` since we don't really `meck` anything in the module\r\n\r\n * Don't need to spend time cleaning out database as we don't really create\r\n   that many dbs (just one) and that one gets cleaned out in its own test.\r\n\r\nTo test run:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  make eunit apps=couch_jobs\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr just observer the jenkins CI tests\r\n\r\n(It might be easier to inspect the diff by doing a split view and also ignore whitespace

Overview\r\n\r\nWhen function `chttpd_external:json_req_obj/2` acquiring `peer` it's always trying to read it from a socket, which doesn't work on a foreign node, because socket is unavailable there. We, however, read `peer` at request time in `chttpd:handle_request_int/1` and store it in `#httpd` record.\r\n\r\nThis change makes advantage of that and changes `chttpd_external:json_req_obj/2` to read `peer` from the stored record first and fail back to the socket reading only when it's not available there.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThere were no tests for `chttpd_external` module, so I added a new test suite `chttpd_external_test` that covers  the changes. To run an isolated run execute: `make eunit apps=chttpd suites=chttpd_external_test`\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in
