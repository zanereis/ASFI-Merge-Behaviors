Change Logs\r\nWhen merge the log files for MOR table, it can not generate partition values if we drop partition columns while upsert data. As a result, the updated rows in log files will get null for partition columns.\r\n\r\nTo prevent this issue, we suggest disable `DROP_PARTITION_COLUMNS` while upsert MOR table.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nFix bug in get partition values from path in MOR log files.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently we will list all partitions paths when calling 'alter table drop partition' to check if the table is hive style partitions and URL encoded. Listing all partitions path is expensive and we can  get these configs from table config instead. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis behavior is aligh with 'insert into table', see `org.apache.spark.sql.hudi.ProvidesHoodieConfig#buildHoodieInsertConfig`. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nGet `hiveStylePartitioningEnable` and `urlEncodePartitioning` from table config when 'alter table drop partition'.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read

Which can be overwritten in `Source` if  external schemaProvider is not null . \r\nIf we sanitize after we create RowBasedSchemaProvider , then schema mismatch is happening ( df.schema is not same as inputBatch.getSchemaProvider.schema)\r\nThis Fix will do Sanitization in RowSource \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nStacked on top of #9581 \r\n\r\nMain changes in this PR:\r\n\r\n- Add a new implementation `HoodiePositionBasedMergedLogRecordReader` that uses record positions to do merging.\r\n- Add following methods in `BaseHoodieLogRecordReader`:  `processNextDeletePosition(long position)` and `processNextRecord(T record, Map<String, Object> metadata, Option<Long> position)`. These are used for position based merging. Positions are available from the log block headers.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImproved log record reader performance, better than key-based merging.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\nThe new reader is used only when `shouldUseRecordPositions` is set to true.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\norg.apache.hudi.io.storage.HoodieAvroHFileReader.RecordIterator#hasNext uses org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.HFileScanner#isSeeked to seek to the first line of the file.\r\n```\r\n

isSeeked would still return false and the next time hasNext is called it seeks to start of file again leading to an infinite loop.\r\n\r\nDocumentation for HFileScanner#isSeeked\r\nTrue is scanner has had one of the seek calls invoked; i.e. seekBefore(Cell) or seekTo() or seekTo(Cell).

Change Logs\r\nCurrently during clustering of noncompacted mor filegroups with row writer disabled (currently the default for clustering), the records in the base file are applied to the log scanner after the log files have been scanned. If they have the same precombine, the base file records will be chosen over the log file records. This pr mimics the implementation in iterators.scala to make the behavior consistent.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nclustering now works as expected\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nMade changes to existing Hudi docs schema evolution scala example code. Earlier code was written for 0.11 version compatible with Spark 3.1.2. I made changes to align the example with Hudi 0.13.1 and Spark 3.3.3.\r\n\r\nAlso added Python equivalent of the code on Hudi 0.13.1 and Spark 3.3.3.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nUpdated schema evolution page's code sample for scala and added python sample.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nThe update was to the docs.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn order to support multiple base file format for a Hudi table, following changes have been done:\r\n\r\n1. Added a new table config which is boolean to indicate whether this table supports multiple base file formats. By default, it is false.\r\n2. File formats are decided based on file extension and then the writer/reader is created.\r\n3. On the Spark reader side, a new `FileFormat` implementation has been introduced. `HoodieMultipleBaseFileFormat` is created only when the above table config is set to true.\r\n4. Change has been tested for snapshot reads for both MOR and COW table.\r\n5. Does not yet support bootstrap table and incremental queries.\r\n\r\nUsers need to set `hoodie.table.multiple.base.file.formats.enable=true` to be able to read/write with multiple base file formats.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis is a format change. Only newer Hudi table versions will support it. Note that the change in compatible i.e. the readers used for the new relation should work even if multiple table formats is not enabled. \r\nThe performance impact is minimal. There is on extra iteration over the splits in order to infer the file format from the file extension.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-21T15:18:50Z","updated_at":"2023-10-26T03:57:02Z","closed_at":"2023-10-26T03:57:02Z","merged_at":"2023-10-26T03:57:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"8bf44c01b56dd3afe5323dc7566971cee2e46d50","assignee":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5167491007,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABNAGnvw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/release-1.0.0","name":"release-1.0.0","color":"E82785","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5792582416,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABWUPLEA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/format-change","name":"format-change","color":"B73609","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/9761/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/9761/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/9761/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/4ec731d4168128cc93e3be5d7f6c444aceacb970","head":{"label":"codope:HUDI-6821-base-file-fmt","ref":"HUDI-6821-base-file-fmt","sha":"4ec731d4168128cc93e3be5d7f6c444aceacb970","user":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":357429656,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTc0Mjk2NTY=","name":"hudi","full_name":"codope/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privac

Now we check the commit metadata to ensure it is a cluster commit.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nclustering now works as expected if lots of insert_overwrite is used\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR moves log merging and memory-related configs to `hudi-common` module so the common file group read can use them.  Configs in `HoodieRealtimeConfig` are removed if duplicate or merged to existing config.\r\n- Moved from `HoodieCompactionConfig` to `HoodieReaderConfig`: `hoodie.compaction.lazy.block.read`(with alternative key `compaction.lazy.block.read.enabled`), `hoodie.compaction.reverse.log.read`\r\n- `HoodieMemoryConfig` is moved from `hudi-client-common` to `hudi-common` module\r\n- `HoodieRealtimeConfig` is removed.\r\n  - `compaction.memory.fraction` is merged with `hoodie.memory.compaction.fraction`.  Default value for MR is kept.\r\n  - `compaction.lazy.block.read.enabled` is merged with `hoodie.compaction.lazy.block.read`.\r\n  - `hoodie.memory.dfs.buffer.max.size` already exists in `HoodieMemoryConfig`.  Default value for MR is kept.\r\n  - `hoodie.memory.spillable.map.path` already exists in `HoodieMemoryConfig`.\r\n  - `hoodie.optimized.log.blocks.scan.enable` is moved to `HoodieReaderConfig`.\r\nAs a result, two config names are removed:\r\n- `compaction.memory.fraction` -> `hoodie.memory.compaction.fraction`\r\n- `compaction.lazy.block.read.enabled` -> `hoodie.compaction.lazy.block.read`\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nCode refactoring towards consistent logic in log merging and file group reading.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nChange how out of the box schema evolution works so it is easier to understand both by users and Hudi developers.\r\n\r\nThings you can't do:\r\n- reorder columns\r\n- add new meta columns to nested structs\r\n\r\n#### Added and Dropped Columns\r\n- New fields can be added to the end of the schema or to the end of nested structs. Those fields will be in the schema of any future write.\r\n- Fields in the latest table schema that are missing from the incoming schema will be added to the incoming data with null values.\r\n\r\n#### Type Promotion\r\n\r\nPromotions work on complex types such as arrays or maps as well\r\nPromotions:\r\n- int is promotable to long, float, double, or string\r\n- long is promotable to float, double, or string\r\n- float is promotable to double or string\r\n- string is promotable to bytes\r\n- bytes is promotable to string\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n- If the incoming schema has a column that is promoted from the table schema's column type, the field will be the promoted type in the tables schema from now on\r\n- If the incoming schema has a column that is demoted from the table schema's column type, the incoming batch will have it's data promoted to the incoming schema\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nChange how out of the box schema evolution works so it is easier to understand both by users and Hudi developers.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nHigh\r\n\r\nlots of testing has been done, including performance testing on tpcds 1tb to ensure MOR avro log block reading has not been degraded\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n[jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-6958)\r\n\r\n[pr](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/9881)\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen schema on read is enabled and user drops a column, then the commit goes through and column is dropped but `schemaId` is incorrecty set to `maxColumnId`. This is a bug. Firstly, drop column is a delete action which should not change the `maxColumnId`. Secondly, `schemaId` must always map to the commit time producing the schema change otherwise it breaks on the reader side or subsequent writes when schema on read is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nBug fix.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFew issues to clean up in our spark quick start guide. \r\n1. Added code snippets for keyless table in addition to primary keyed tables. \r\n2. Simplified entire quick start to focus only on CRUD operations.

Removed adhoc spark-sql commands, procedures and added references to other pages.  \r\n5. Our quick start page had references to deprecated config keys.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the checkpoint reading in Hudi streaming sink in Spark structured streaming.  The fix avoids reading the requested compaction or clustering plan which is serialized in Avro, causing the deserialization to fail and only scan the commit metadata of completed commits, which are serialized in JSON. Without the fix, the Avro serialized plan throws exceptions (see below).  A new test is added to validate the correctness of reading checkpoint for Hudi streaming sink in Spark structured streaming.\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.hudi.exception.HoodieIOException: Failed to parse

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFor SQL DDL:\r\n- changed \"options\" to \"tblproperties\" since this is recommended \r\n- changed the config table to match the big configs page formatting\r\n- Made a link to set-hoodie-config-options when we reference that in another section\r\n\r\nFor Procedures:\r\n- any param description that was of the format \"Configuration as 'hoodie.configuration.key'\" I replaced with the config description\r\n- any param that represents a hudi config, I link to the config in the configs page\r\n- run_compaction added new parameter \"options\" and an example of usage\r\n- run_clean was missing so I added it and some examples\r\n- hive_sync added sync_incremental parameter\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMore accurate, and hopefully more useful documentation\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's
