Glad to work with the community.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- added C++ operator under `src/operator/contrib/adabelief*`\r\n- briefly modified `src/operator/contrib/adamw*` to avoid symbol name clashes\r\n- `src/operator/contrib/adabelief*`\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This is mostly a copycat of AdamW optimizer, and therefore fair amount of code duplication. It might be a good idea to perform a refactor regarding adam-like optimizers later.\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-20T08:32:37Z","updated_at":"2023-05-03T06:58:31Z","closed_at":"2021-04-30T14:46:04Z","merged_at":"2021-04-30T14:46:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"059a05549e7892007a9490e9ca2987d22ddec816","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThe goal is to add support to the C API to enable APIs for using MXNet as a model server application. For example, the regular `MXPredCreateEx` API assumes it will be given the `param_bytes` and `param_size` which are the raw params file data. But in this application the params data wont be available, instead arrays of pre-processed data will be provided in the `input_data` argument with the corresponding `input_shape_data` for each tensor. \r\n\r\nWe also add a new env var MXNET_GPU_MEM_POOL_LIMIT to allow users to limit the amount of memory MXNet can use for tensor allocations. Previously MXNet assumed it gets to use all the GPU memory (minus the amount reserved). For example, in the past you could say for 16GB of GPU memory reserve 5% (0.8GB) for other use and MXNet would use the remaining 15.2GB for tensor data. But with this PR you can tell MXNet to only use 4GB (by specifying 25%) so the rest of the GPU memory could be used for other applications (ie. non-MX pre/post-processing, or duplicating instances of MX sharing the same GPU for higher utilization in a model server). \r\n\r\n### C API changes\r\nThese are the public facing C API changes.\r\n#### MXGetBytesInUse\r\n```\r\nsize_t MXGetBytesInUse(int dev_type, int dev_id);\r\n```\r\nA new API that returns the amount of memory used by MXNet for the given context (dev type & ID)\r\n\r\n### C Predict API changes\r\nThese are the changes to the public facing C Predict API\r\n#### DType\r\n```\r\nenum DType {\r\n    kDTypeFloat32 = 0,\r\n    kDTypeFloat64 = 1,\r\n    kDTypeFloat16 = 2,\r\n    kDTypeUInt8 = 3,\r\n    kDTypeInt32 = 4,\r\n    kDTypeInt8 = 5,\r\n    kDTypeInt64 = 6\r\n};\r\n```\r\nA new enum to expose MXNet data types (previously CpredictAPI always used mxfloat for everything)\r\n\r\n#### MXPredCreateEx2\r\nA new API, similar to MXPredCreateEx but does not require param_bytes/param_size (ie. the void* pointer to param data file loaded from disk). \r\n```\r\nint MXPredCreateEx2(const char* symbol_json_str,\r\n                              int dev_type, int dev_id,\r\n                              const char** input_keys,\r\n                              const void** input_data,\r\n                              const int* input_dtypes,\r\n                              const mx_uint* input_shape_indptr,\r\n                              const mx_uint* input_shape_data,\r\n                              const mx_uint num_input_nodes,\r\n                              PredictorHandle* out);\r\n```\r\nInstead takes params the same as inputs via the input_* arguments (ie. input_keys, input_data, etc.). This will be used when there is no params file on disk (imagine that the param tensor data is already in memory somewhere and sent from a client to a model server). \r\n\r\n#### MXPredCreatePartialOutEx\r\nA new API, similar to MXPredCreatePartialOut but does not require param_bytes/param_size (ie. the void* pointer to param data file loaded from disk). \r\n```\r\nint MXPredCreatePartialOutEx(const char* symbol_json_str,\r\n                                       int dev_type, int dev_id,\r\n                                       const char** input_keys,\r\n                                       const mx_float** input_data,\r\n                                       const mx_uint* input_shape_indptr,\r\n                                       const mx_uint* input_shape_data,\r\n                                       const mx_uint num_input_nodes,\r\n                                       const mx_uint num_output_nodes,\r\n                                       const char** output_keys,\r\n                                       PredictorHandle* out);\r\n```\r\nInstead takes params the same as inputs via the input_* arguments (ie. input_keys, input_data, etc.). This will be used when there is no params file on disk (imagine that the param tensor data is already in memory somewhere and sent from a client to a model server). \r\n\r\n#### MXPredCreatePartialOutEx2\r\nA new API, similar to MXPredCreatePartialOutEx but allows specifying input_dtypes instead of requiring inputs to be in mxfloat type. \r\n```\r\nint MXPredCreatePartialOutEx2(const char* symbol_json_str,\r\n                                        int dev_type, int dev_id,\r\n                                        const char** input_keys,\r\n                                        const void** input_data,\r\n                                        const int* input_dtypes,\r\n                                        const mx_uint* input_shape_indptr,\r\n                                        const mx_uint* input_shape_data,\r\n                                        const mx_uint num_input_nodes,\r\n                                        const mx_uint num_output_nodes,\r\n                                        const char** output_keys,\r\n                                        PredictorHandle* out);\r\n```\r\nIt also changes the type for input_data to void* instead of mxfloat. \r\n\r\n#### MXPredGetOutputNames\r\nA new API, that returns the list of output node names for a predictor object.\r\n```\r\nint MXPredGetOutputNames(PredictorHandle handle,\r\n                                   mx_uint *out_names_length,\r\n                                   const char ***out_names);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### MXPredGetInputShape\r\nA new API, that returns the shape of an input node.\r\n```\r\nint MXPredGetInputShape(PredictorHandle handle,\r\n                                   const char* key,\r\n                                   mx_uint** shape_data,\r\n                                   mx_uint* shape_ndim,\r\n                                   int* key_found);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### MXPredGetInputType\r\nA new API, that returns the dtype of input node.\r\n```\r\nint MXPredGetInputType(PredictorHandle handle,\r\n                                  const char* key,\r\n                                  int* dtype,\r\n                                  int* key_found);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### MXNDListGetEx\r\nA new API, like MXNDListGet but also returns the dtype. \r\n```\r\nint MXNDListGetEx(NDListHandle handle,\r\n                            mx_uint index,\r\n                            const char** out_key,\r\n                            const void** out_data,\r\n                            int* out_dtype,\r\n                            const mx_uint** out_shape,\r\n                            mx_uint* out_ndim);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Storage Class changes\r\nChanges to the core storage class.\r\n\r\n#### GetMemoryInUseInBytes\r\nA new API in the storage class that returns the number of bytes allocated thus far. \r\n```\r\nsize_t GetMemoryInUseInBytes(const Context &ctx);\r\n```\r\nThe function returns 0 and prints a warning message if an instance of a storage class for that context has not been constructed yet (ie. if there were no allocations for that context yet). Otherwise it returns the amount of memory allocated in bytes. \r\n\r\nA default implementation of the function throws an error if not implemented for that particular subclass of Storage. This PR only implements the function for GPUPooledStorageManager.\r\n\r\n### GPUPooledStorageManager Class changes\r\nChanges to the GPUPooledStorageManager subclass.\r\n\r\n#### free_list_size_\r\nA new class variable that accounts for the amount of free memory in the internal memory pool. It is used to calculate the amount of memory actually used as Tensor data by MXNet. \r\n\r\n#### float type for reserve_\r\nChanges the reserve_ variable from int to float so users can specify more granularity (ie. 3.5%) for how much memory to reserve for non-tensor GPU allocations (ie. descriptors). \r\n\r\n#### memory_limit_percentage_\r\nA new class variable to allow users to artificially limit the amount of memory available to MXNet for tensor data via the MXNET_GPU_MEM_POOL_LIMIT environment variable. For example, on a machine with 16GB of GPU memory, can limit MXNet to 4GB so that users can run 4x copies of MXNet in separate processes and share the same GPU for model serving efficiency improvements. Basically changes the internal accounting from using the real total memory returned by CUDA to the user-constrained amount. \r\n\r\nThe enforcement of the limit works like this whenever a new tensor is being allocated. If the size of the new tensor plus the total amount of memory already is use is greater than the limit we throw an error. \r\n```\r\nif (used_memory_ + size > mem_limit_in_bytes)\r\n   LOG(FATAL) << \"memory limit reached ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [ ]

https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/19610:\r\n\r\n> Intel MKL-DNN was renamed with DNNL in its v1.1 release. Since then, the MXNet community has been working on the transition to DNNL to leverage the latest features and optimizations from the library. That includes using the string “DNNL” or “dnnl” for future development and communication. We propose to promote the flag “USE_DNNL” since MXNet 2.0 and start deprecating “USE_MKLDNN” at the same time.\r\n> DNNL source code resides in the 3rdparty/mkldnn folder of the MXNet repository and is released and distributed along with MXNet source code. If one wants to build MXNet with DNNL to accelerate the execution on Intel CPU, she/he needs to enable -DUSE_DNNL=ON in CMake. However, this flag has been set to ON by default for all platforms except edge devices. On the contrary, to disable the DNNL acceleration, one needs to set -DUSE_DNNL=OFF explicitly in the CMake command line or the CMake configuration file.\r\n> As both MXNet and DNNL are under quick development with different release cadence, we decide to link the DNNL library into MXNet statically to avoid mis-linking in the user's environment. Given this, we need to set DNNL_LIBRARY_TYPE to STATIC when building DNNL.\r\n> Some additional flags to build DNNL:\r\n> \r\n> DNNl_CPU_RUNTIME: Need set it to SEQ explicitly when USE_OPENMP=OFF;\r\n> DNNL_ARCH_OPT_FLAGS: Need pass compiler options to this build flag in string. Eg. -march or -mtune for GCC.\r\n> MKLDNN_BUILD_TESTS and MKLDNN_BUILD_EXAMPLES: We set these two flags to OFF to speed up the compilation.\r\n> One thing that needs to be taken care of is that the header dnnl_config.h and dnnl_version.h will be generated dynamically during compilation and will be copied to the installation destination when calling make install. That means these two headers are not distributed with DNNL source code. For downstream projects which are including these headers need to find them in the installation path rather than the source code path.\r\n\r\nI prepared three commits regarding this point of main RFC:\r\n1. changing USE_MKLDNN flag name to USE_ONEDNN to make it consistent with actual library name\r\nI believe that this commit is complete and if there is such a will can be merged into master.\r\n\r\n2. changing MXNET_USE_MKLDNN* flags names to MXNET_USE_ONEDNN* also for consistency reasons\r\nThis commit regards changing inner MXNET flag so that it will be consistent with the actual lib name. To avoid creating even bigger mixture of mkldnn/dnnl/onednn acronyms I believe it should be accompanied with another commit changing acronyms used in mxnet function names and comments regarding this particular lib to oneDNN.\r\n\r\n3. changing the 3rdparty/mkldnn folder name to 3rdparty/onednn for consistency.
