What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdding support to hyperbolic functions like asinh\\acosh\\atanh in spark SQL.\r\nFeature parity: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-math.html#FUNCTIONS-MATH-HYP-TABLE\r\n\r\nThe followings are the diffence from PostgreSQL.\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> SELECT acosh(0);     (PostgreSQL returns `ERROR:  input is out of range`)\r\nNaN\r\n\r\nspark-sql> SELECT atanh(2);     (PostgreSQL returns `ERROR:  input is out of range`)\r\nNaN\r\n```\r\n\r\nTeradata has similar behavior as PostgreSQL with out of range input float values - It outputs **Invalid Input: numeric value within range only.**\r\n\r\nThese newly added asinh/acosh/atanh handles special input(NaN, +-Infinity) in the same way as existing cos/sin/tan/acos/asin/atan in spark. For which input value range is not (-∞, ∞)):\r\nout of range float values: Spark returns NaN and PostgreSQL shows input is out of range\r\nNaN: Spark returns NaN, PostgreSQL also returns NaN\r\nInfinity: Spark return NaN, PostgreSQL shows input is out of range\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"select asinh(xx)\")\r\nspark.sql(\"select acosh(xx)\")\r\nspark.sql(\"select atanh(xx)\")\r\n\r\n./build/sbt \"testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.MathFunctionsSuite\"\r\n./build/sbt \"testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe current RuleExecutor system contains two kinds of strategies: Once and FixedPoint. The Once strategy is supposed to run once.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`PullOutNondeterministic` is a once analyzer rule, therefore should follow idempotence property. The `PullOutNondeterministic` rule transforms aggregates when the aggregating expression has sub-expressions whose `deterministic` field is set to false. However, this might break `PullOutNondeterministic`'s idempotence property since the actually aggregation rewriting will only transform those with `NonDeterministic` trait, leading to useless intermediate projects.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting UTs and new UTs.\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-02T21:08:16Z","updated_at":"2019-07-03T20:05:23Z","closed_at":"2019-07-03T20:05:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2067270d821897ef7a4e087c7ee109c6fef7a1ab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25036/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25036/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25036/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/363733f7944aac77cecaec8f4f42e1d608400e9e","head":{"label":"yeshengm:spark-28236","ref":"spark-28236","sha":"363733f7944aac77cecaec8f4f42e1d608400e9e","user":{"login":"yeshengm","id":12269969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY5OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12269969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm","html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187889692,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc4ODk2OTI=","name":"spark","full_name":"yeshengm/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yeshengm","id":12269969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY5OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12269969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm","html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark's decimal operations implementation follows what SQLServer does. This is not true for the `Sum` operation. In that case, SQLServer returns `DECIMAL(38, s)` where `s` is the scale of the input of the sum operator. Spark instead, uses as precision of the result type `p + 10` where `p` is the precision of the input type. This can cause overflows, which can be avoided with a higher precision: it happens in particular with sums of many decimals with a small precision.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nchanged

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Currently `sum` in aggregates for decimal type can overflow and return null.\r\n  - `Sum` expression codegens arithmetic on `sql.Decimal` and the output which preserves scale and precision goes into `UnsafeRowWriter`. Here overflowing will be converted to null when writing out.\r\n  - It also does not go through this branch in `DecimalAggregates` because it's expecting precision of the sum (not the elements to be summed) to be less than 5.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/4ebff5b6d68f26cc1ff9265a5489e0d7c2e05449/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/optimizer/Optimizer.scala#L1400-L1403\r\n\r\n- This PR adds the check at the final result of the sum operator itself.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/4ebff5b6d68f26cc1ff9265a5489e0d7c2e05449/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/aggregate/interfaces.scala#L372-L376\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28224\r\n\r\n##

PolynomialExpansion I added expansion for root degrees.\r\n\r\nI created a pull request for the same problem in the file PolynomialExpansionGeneralized, I shall close it to avoid confusions. \r\n\r\nFor example, for root degree 3, and basis vector (x,y) we have : (x, x^(1/2), x^(1/3), y, y^(1/2), y^(1/3)\r\nWe can merge simple polynomial expansion with root polynomial expansion: for simple degree 2 and root degree 2:\r\nx, y, xy, x^2, y^2, x^(1/2), y^(1/2)\r\n\r\nI used java.lang.Math.pow, and there is a case in it :\r\nIf the first argument is finite and less than zero and if the second argument is finite and not an integer,then the result is NaN\r\nFor this case I raised a IllegalArgumentException; the user should normalize the features in order to have only positive features.\r\n\r\nThe case of root degree polynomial expansion is mentioned in the Stanford Machine Learning course on Coursera.\r\nIt helped myself to minimize error when performing Linear Regression.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTo PolynomialExpansion I added expansion for root degrees.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nI did manual test on different numeric data (Integer, Double, positive, negative, zero, very large numbers, very small numbers). I tested also that the value x^1 appears once and only once in the features, whatever the setting is (setDegree only, setDegreeRoot only, both setDegree and setDegreeRoot).\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor Spark SQL, it can't support sql like :\r\n`SELECT TRANSFORM ( d2, max(d1) as maxd1, cast(sum(d3) as string))`\r\n`USING 'cat' AS (a,b,c)`\r\n`FROM script_trans`\r\n`WHERE d1 <= 100`\r\n`GROUP BY d2`\r\n`HAVING maxd1 > 0`\r\n\r\nBut in hive, it can support this kind SQL.\r\nThis makes our SQL migration difficult and complex。\r\nThis PR is to support use Aggregation with TRANSFORM and make SQL migration from Hive to Sparkeasier.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDefines a new subclass of UDF: `UserDefinedAggregator`. Also allows `Aggregator` to be registered as a udf.  Under the hood, the implementation is based on the internal `TypedImperativeAggregate` class that spark's predefined aggregators make use of. The effect is that custom user defined aggregators are now serialized only on partition boundaries instead of being serialized and deserialized at each input row.\r\n\r\nThe two new modes of using `Aggregator` are as follows:\r\n```scala\r\nval agg: Aggregator[IN, BUF, OUT] = // typed aggregator\r\nval udaf1 = UserDefinedAggregator(agg)\r\nval udaf2 = spark.udf.register(\"agg\", agg)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit testing has been added that corresponds to the testing suites for `UserDefinedAggregateFunction`. Additionally, unit tests explicitly count the number of aggregator ser/de cycles to ensure that it is governed only by the number of data partitions.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate the performance impact, I did two comparisons.\r\nThe code and REPL results are recorded on [this gist](https://gist.github.com/erikerlandson/b0e106a4dbaf7f80b4f4f3a21f05f892)\r\nTo characterize its behavior I benchmarked both a relatively simple aggregator and then an aggregator with a complex structure (a t-digest).\r\n\r\n### performance\r\nThe following compares the new `Aggregator` based aggregation against UDAF. In this scenario, the new aggregation is about 100x faster. The difference in performance impact depends on the complexity of the aggregator. For very simple aggregators (e.g. implementing 'sum', etc), the performance impact is more like 25-30%.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> import scala.util.Random._, org.apache.spark.sql.Row,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change adds capability to return Calender interval type from udf by exposing `CalendarIntervalType` and `CalendarInterval`.\r\n\r\nEarlier, the udf of Type `(String => CalendarInterval)` was throwing Exception stating:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSchema for type org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.CalendarInterval is not supported\r\njava.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Schema for type org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.CalendarInterval is not supported\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.ScalaReflection391anonfun.apply(ScalaReflection.scala:781)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded test case in `ScalaReflectionSuite.scala` and `ExpressionEncoderSuite`\r\nAlso, tested by creating an udf that returns Calendar interval.\r\n\r\njira entry for detail:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMainly change logs:\r\n### Version 3.0.13:\r\n- Support for JDK 9/10 in Full Compiler\r\n- The syntax elements that can have modifiers now all have sets of \"is...()\" methods that check for each modifier. Some also have methods \"getAccess()\" and/or \"getAnnotations()\".\r\n- Implement \"type annotations\" (JLS8 9.7.4)\r\n- Implemented parsing (but not compilation) of \"modular compilation units\" (JLS11 7.3).\r\n- Replaced all \"assert...Uncookable(..., Pattern messageRegex)\" and \"assert...Uncookable(..., String messageInfix)\" method pairs with a single \"assert...Uncookable(..., String messageRegex)\" method.\r\nMinor refactoring: Allowed modifiers are now checked in the Parser, not in Java.*. This saves a lot of THROWS clauses.\r\n- Parse Type inference syntax: Type inference for generic instance creation implemented, test cases added.\r\n- Parse MethodReference, ClassInstanceCreationReference and ArrayCreationReference\r\n\r\n### Version 3.0.12\r\n- Fixed: Operator \"&\" not defined on types \"java.lang.Long\" and \"int\"\r\n- Major bug in JavaSourceClassLoader: When loading the second and following classes, CUs were compiled again, leading to an inconsistent class hierarchy.\r\n- Fixed: Java 9 added \"@Override public final CharBuffer CharBuffer.rewind() { ...\" -- leads easily to a java.lang.NoSuchMethodError\r\n- Changed all occurences of the words \"Java bytecode\" to \"JVM bytecode\" to make clearer that the generated bytecode is for the JVMS and not suitable for, e.g. DALVIK.\r\n\r\nhttp://janino-compiler.github.io/janino/changelog.html\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOptimizer rule `PushPredicateThroughJoin` will try to push parent filter down though the join, however, when the parent filter is wholly pushed down through the join, the join will become the top node, and then the `transform` method will skip the join to apply the rule. \r\n\r\nSuppose we have two tables: table1 and table2:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntable1: (a: string, b: string, c: string)\r\n\r\ntable2: (d: string)\r\n```\r\n\r\nsql as:\r\n\r\n`select * from table1 left join (select d, 'w1' as r from table2) on a = d and r = 'w2' where b = 2`\r\n \r\n\r\nlet's focus on the following optimizer rules:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPushPredicateThroughJoin\r\n\r\nFodablePropagation\r\n\r\nBooleanSimplification\r\n\r\nPruneFilters\r\n```\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the above case, on the first iteration of these rules:\r\n\r\nPushPredicateThroughJoin -> \r\n`\r\nselect * from table1 where b=2 left join (select d, 'w1' as r from table2) on a = d and r = 'w2'`\r\nFodablePropagation ->\r\n\r\n`select * from table1 where b=2 left join (select d, 'w1' as r from table2) on a = d and 'w1' = 'w2'`\r\nBooleanSimplification ->\r\n\r\n`select * from table1 where b=2 left join (select d, 'w1' as r from table2) on false`\r\nPruneFilters -> No effective\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAfter several iteration of these rules, the join condition will still never be pushed to the \r\n\r\nright hand of the left join. thus, in some case(e.g. Large right table), the `BroadcastNestedLoopJoin` may be slow or oom.\r\n\r\nThis PR will fix this problem!\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexist UT\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-01T09:29:19Z","updated_at":"2019-09-16T23:52:00Z","closed_at":"2019-09-16T23:51:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fbd7f2a44fc018a01e1a3449aac1b29b760a6079","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25020/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25020/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25020/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1c03495f83770aa9a0c6aaa6ce9f768cc91a939e","head":{"label":"liupc:Fix-SPARK-28220","ref":"Fix-SPARK-28220","sha":"1c03495f83770aa9a0c6aaa6ce9f768cc91a939e","user":{"login":"liupc","id":6747355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDczNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6747355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc","html_url":"https://github.com/liupc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":75380071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NTM4MDA3MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liupc/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liupc","id":6747355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDczNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6747355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc","html_url":"https://github.com/liupc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liupc/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Currently, `ExpressionEncoder` does not handle bigdecimal overflow. Round-tripping overflowing java/scala BigDecimal/BigInteger returns null.\r\n  - The serializer encode java/scala BigDecimal to to sql Decimal, which still has the underlying data to the former.\r\n  - When writing out to UnsafeRow, `changePrecision` will be false and row has null value.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/24e1e41648de58d3437e008b187b84828830e238/sql/catalyst/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/codegen/UnsafeRowWriter.java#L202-L206\r\n- In [SPARK-23179](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20350), an option to throw exception on decimal overflow was introduced.\r\n- This PR adds the option in `ExpressionEncoder` to throw when detecting overflowing BigDecimal/BigInteger before its corresponding Decimal gets written to Row. This gives a consistent behavior between decimal arithmetic on sql expression (DecimalPrecision), and getting decimal from dataframe (RowEncoder)\r\n\r\nThanks to @mgaido91 for the very first PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark currently has two built-in statistics plan visitor: `SizeInBytesOnlyStatsPlanVisitor` and `BasicStatsPlanVisitor`. However, this is a bit limited since there is no way to plug in a custom plan visitor from which a query optimizer can benefit.\r\n\r\nThis PR allowers the user to specify a custom stat plan visitor via a Spark conf to override the built-in one:\r\n\r\n```Scala\r\n// First create your custom stat plan visitor.\r\nclass MyStatsPlanVisitor extends LogicalPlanVisitor[Statistics] {\r\n  // Implement LogicalPlanVisitor[Statistics] trait\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Set the visitor via Spark conf.\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.catalyst.statsPlanVisitorClass\", \"MyStatsPlanVisitor\")\r\n\r\n// Now, stat() on a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn SPARK-23179, it has been introduced a flag to control the behavior in case of overflow on decimals. The behavior is: returning `null` when `spark.sql.decimalOperations.nullOnOverflow` (default and traditional Spark behavior); throwing an `ArithmeticException` if that conf is false (according to SQL standards, other DBs behavior).\r\n\r\n`MakeDecimal` so far had an ambiguous behavior. In case of codegen mode, it returned `null` as the other operators, but in interpreted mode, it was throwing an `IllegalArgumentException`.\r\n\r\nThe PR aligns `MakeDecimal`'s behavior with the one of other operators as defined in SPARK-23179. So now both modes return `null` or throw `ArithmeticException` according to `spark.sql.decimalOperations.nullOnOverflow`'s value.\r\n\r\nCredits for this PR to @mickjermsurawong-stripe who pointed out the wrong behavior in #20350.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nimproved

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs part of the shuffle storage API proposed in SPARK-25299, this introduces an API for persisting shuffle data in arbitrary storage systems.\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces several concepts:\r\n* `ShuffleDataIO`, which is the root of the entire plugin tree that will be proposed over the course of the shuffle API project.\r\n* `ShuffleExecutorComponents` - the subset of plugins for managing shuffle-related components for each executor. This will in turn instantiate shuffle readers and writers.\r\n* `ShuffleMapOutputWriter` interface - instantiated once per map task. This provides child `ShufflePartitionWriter` instances for persisting the bytes for each partition in the map task.\r\n\r\nThe default implementation of these plugins exactly mirror what was done by the existing shuffle writing code - namely, writing the data to local disk and writing an index file. We leverage the APIs in the `BypassMergeSortShuffleWriter` only.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd docstring/doctest for `SCALAR_ITER` Pandas UDF.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe syntax 'LIKE predicate: ESCAPE clause' is a ANSI SQL.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect 'abcSpark_13sd' LIKE '%Spark\\\\_%';             //true\r\nselect 'abcSpark_13sd' LIKE '%Spark/_%';              //false\r\nselect 'abcSpark_13sd' LIKE '%Spark\"_%';              //false\r\nselect 'abcSpark_13sd' LIKE '%Spark/_%' ESCAPE '/';   //true\r\nselect 'abcSpark_13sd' LIKE '%Spark\"_%' ESCAPE '\"';   //true\r\nselect 'abcSpark%13sd' LIKE '%Spark\\\\%%';             //true\r\nselect 'abcSpark%13sd' LIKE '%Spark/%%';              //false\r\nselect 'abcSpark%13sd' LIKE '%Spark\"%%';              //false\r\nselect 'abcSpark%13sd' LIKE '%Spark/%%' ESCAPE '/';   //true\r\nselect 'abcSpark%13sd' LIKE '%Spark\"%%' ESCAPE '\"';   //true\r\nselect 'abcSpark\\\\13sd' LIKE '%Spark\\\\\\\\_%';          //true\r\nselect 'abcSpark/13sd' LIKE '%Spark//_%';             //false\r\nselect 'abcSpark\"13sd' LIKE '%Spark\"\"_%';             //false\r\nselect 'abcSpark/13sd' LIKE '%Spark//_%' ESCAPE '/';  //true\r\nselect 'abcSpark\"13sd' LIKE '%Spark\"\"_%' ESCAPE '\"';  //true\r\n```\r\nBut Spark SQL only supports 'LIKE predicate'.\r\n\r\nNote: If the input string or pattern string is null, then the result is null too.\r\n\r\nThere are some mainstream database support the syntax.\r\n\r\n**PostgreSQL:**\r\nhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/functions-matching.html\r\n\r\n**Vertica:**\r\nhttps://www.vertica.com/docs/9.2.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/SQLReferenceManual/LanguageElements/Predicates/LIKE-predicate.htm?zoom_highlight=like%20escape\r\n\r\n**MySQL:**\r\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/string-comparison-functions.html\r\n\r\n**Oracle:**\r\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/jjdbc/JDBC-reference-information.html#GUID-5D371A5B-D7F6-42EB-8C0D-D317F3C53708\r\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/Pattern-matching-Conditions.html#GUID-0779657B-06A8-441F-90C5-044B47862A0A\r\n\r\n**Teradata**\r\nhttps://docs.teradata.com/reader/756LNiPSFdY~4JcCCcR5Cw/ZP3CE_cR~e7V50zVkzzeVQ\r\n\r\n**Snowflake**\r\nhttps://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/functions/like.html\r\n\r\n##

This PR allows map N to M like flatMap.\r\n\r\nThis API mimics the way of `mapPartitions` but keeps API shape of `SCALAR_ITER` by allowing different results.\r\n\r\n### How does this PR implement?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds mimics both `dapply` with Arrow optimization and Grouped Map Pandas UDF. At Python execution side, it reuses existing `SCALAR_ITER` code path.\r\n\r\nTherefore, externally, we don't introduce any new type of Pandas UDF but internally we use another evaluation type code `205` (`SQL_MAP_PANDAS_ITER_UDF`).\r\n\r\nThis approach is similar with Pandas' Windows function implementation with Grouped Aggregation Pandas UDF functions - internally we have `203` (`SQL_WINDOW_AGG_PANDAS_UDF`) but externally we just share the same `GROUPED_AGG`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested and unittests were added.","created_at":"2019-06-28T08:07:36Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:18:40Z","closed_at":"2019-07-02T01:58:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f7d2035ce1311746b2ebc0335c2c28ffc9574f2e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406590181,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTkwMTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYSPARK","name":"PYSPARK","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24997/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24997/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24997/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cb403690b2e570298941914c7c7420caf7362416","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:scalar-udf-iter","ref":"scalar-udf-iter","sha":"cb403690b2e570298941914c7c7420caf7362416","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes moving all Trigger implementations to `Triggers.scala`, to avoid exposing these implementations to the end users and let end users only deal with `Trigger.xxx` static methods. This fits the intention of deprecation of `ProcessingTIme`, and we agree to move others without deprecation as this patch will be shipped in major version (Spark 3.0.0).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd materialize API to dataframes. Materialize is a Spark action. It is a way to let Spark explicitly know that the dataframe has already been computed. Once a dataframe is materialized, Spark skips all stages prior to the materialize when the dataframe is reused later on. \r\nPlease refer to [SPARK-28188](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28188) for the rationale behind adding the materialize API \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nTested

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPlease refer [SPARK-28190](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28190) to refer rationalization of introducing new state data source.\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes introducing a new data source \"state\" on streaming query, and enable users' batch query to read state in checkpoint. The new data source is located in `sql-core` module - I didn't create a new module in external since state is not an external storage.\r\n\r\nGiven state itself has no schema information ([SPARK-27237](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27237) is addressing this), this patch includes some tool  (`StateSchemaExtractor`) to extract the schema of state from streaming query. It would be ideal to adopt SPARK-27237 and get rid of this tool.\r\n\r\nState data source leverages existing state store APIs which would be compatible with any state store providers. That said, the data source is generic one, but could be target to specific state store provider to gain optimal performance. (on demand)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UTs.","created_at":"2019-06-27T21:53:59Z","updated_at":"2020-12-18T12:04:45Z","closed_at":"2020-12-18T12:04:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"de814069e8586b9f2a2609f6c611782c59fd7f62","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nwe are adding in generic resource support into spark where we have suffix for the amount of the resource so that we could support other configs.  \r\n\r\nSpark on yarn already had added configs to request resources via the configs spark.yarn.{executor/driver/am}.resource=<some amount>, where the <some amount> is value and unit together.  We should change those configs to have a `.amount` suffix on them to match the spark configs and to allow future configs to be more easily added. YARN itself already supports tags and attributes so if we want the user to be able to pass those from spark at some point having a suffix makes sense. it would allow for a spark.yarn.{executor/driver/am}.resource.{resource}.tag= type config.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested via unit tests and manually on a yarn 3.x cluster with GPU resources configured on.\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-27T21:42:54Z","updated_at":"2019-07-16T18:26:51Z","closed_at":"2019-07-16T18:01:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"865406af7e5c56e5ddde312de456a81c457a09e7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24989/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24989/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24989/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6e86ab9b9db12a88998e54d6358d3ac6143e957a","head":{"label":"tgravescs:SPARK-27959-yarn-resourceconfigs","ref":"SPARK-27959-yarn-resourceconfigs","sha":"6e86ab9b9db12a88998e54d6358d3ac6143e957a","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17249522,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0OTUyMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"tgravescs/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe have a scenario that our application needs to query failed tasks by REST API `/applications/[app-id]/stages/[stage-id]/[stage-attempt-id]/taskList` when Spark job is running. In a large Stage, it may filter out dozens of failed tasks from hundred thousands total tasks. It consumes much unnecessary memory and time both in Spark and App side.\r\n\r\n<del>This work splits to two PRs, the previous is #24982 (even though I commit them together here) since filter should be handled before pagination. (Assume 100 items per page, filtering after pagination may get four pages but each of page only contains several items. Actually one page could contains all the filtered item).</del>\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd UT.\r\nAnd manually test:\r\n(In local mode, there is only one running task by default.)\r\nBefore:\r\n> http://localhost:4040/api/v1/applications/local-1562040123322/stages/3/0/taskList?offset=0&length=10\r\n\r\nReturn 1 running task and 9 success tasks or 10 success tasks.\r\nAfter:\r\n> http://localhost:4040/api/v1/applications/local-1562040123322/stages/3/0/taskList?offset=0&length=10&sortBy=status&status=RUNNING\r\n\r\nOnly return 1 running task or empty if

system, and maintains a blacklist for all event log files failed once at reading. The blacklisted log files are released back after `CLEAN_INTERVAL_S` seconds.\r\n\r\nHowever, the released files whose sizes don't changes are ignored forever due to `info.fileSize < entry.getLen()` condition (previously [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/3c96937c7b1d7a010b630f4b98fd22dafc37808b#diff-a7befb99e7bd7e3ab5c46c2568aa5b3eR454) and now at [shouldReloadLog](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/FsHistoryProvider.scala#L571)) which returns `false` always when the size is the same with the existing value in `KVStore`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark can't push down filter condition of **Or**:\r\n\r\nSuch as if I have a table default.test, his partition col is \"dt\",\r\n\r\nIf we use query : \r\n\r\n`select * from default.test `\r\n` where dt=20190625 or (dt = 20190626 and id in (1,2,3) )`\r\n\r\nIn this case, Spark will resolve **Or** condition as one expression, and since this expr has reference of \"id\", then it can't been push down.\r\n\r\nIn my PR ,  for SQL like \r\n`select * from default.test`\r\n `where  dt = 20190626  or  (dt = 20190626  and xxx=\"\")   `\r\n\r\nFor this **Or**  condition \r\n`or (dt = 20190626  or  (dt = 20190626  and xxx=\"\"   )`\r\n\r\nAll expression about partition keys will be  extracted as an expression only contains partition expression  \r\n and  retain the original logical relationship of **And** & **Or**  like below :\r\n`dt = 20190626  or  dt = 20190626`\r\n\r\nThen this condition will Passed to HiveTableScanExec. Such predicate expressions can be pushed down  as expected .\r\n\r\nFor this PR, it will extract deep relation of OR expression and push down this condition \r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExist unit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch adds the binding classes to enable spark to switch dataframe output to using the S3A zero-rename committers shipping in Hadoop 3.1+. It adds a source tree into the hadoop-cloud-storage module which only compiles with the hadoop-3.2 profile, and contains a binding for normal output and a specific bridge class for Parquet (as the parquet output format requires a subclass of `ParquetOutputCommitter`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCommit algorithms are a critical topic. There's no formal proof of correctness, but the algorithms are documented an analysed in [A Zero Rename Committer](https://github.com/steveloughran/zero-rename-committer/releases). This also reviews the classic v1 and v2 algorithms, IBM's swift committer and the one from EMRFS which they admit was based on the concepts implemented here.\r\n\r\nTest-wise\r\n\r\n* There's a public set of scala test suites [on github](https://github.com/hortonworks-spark/cloud-integration)\r\n* We have run integration tests against Spark on Yarn clusters.\r\n* This code has been shipping for ~12 months in HDP-3.x.

this PR. Will create new one that have specific fixes\r\n1. PR for Float Type and ShortType Fix \r\n2. PR for ByteType Fix.\r\n\r\nFix for ByteType, ShortType and FloatTypes are not correctly mapped for read/write of SQLServer tables\r\n###ByteType issue\r\nWriting dataframe with column type BYTETYPE fails when using JDBC connector for SQL Server. Append and Read of tables also fail. The problem is due \r\n\r\n1. (Write path) Incorrect mapping of BYTETYPE in getCommonJDBCType() in jdbcutils.scala where BYTETYPE gets mapped to BYTE text. It should be mapped to TINYINT\r\ncase ByteType => Option(JdbcType(\"BYTE\", java.sql.Types.TINYINT))\r\n\r\nIn getCatalystType() ( JDBC to Catalyst type mapping) TINYINT is mapped to INTEGER, while it should be mapped to BYTETYPE. Mapping to integer is ok from the point of view of upcasting, but will lead to 4 byte allocation rather than 1 byte for BYTETYPE.\r\n\r\n2. (read path) Read path ends up calling makeGetter(dt: DataType, metadata: Metadata). The function sets the value in RDD row. The value is set per the data type. Here there is no mapping for BYTETYPE and thus results will result in an error when getCatalystType() is fixed.\r\n\r\nNote : These issues were found when reading/writing with SQLServer. Will be submitting a PR soon to fix these mappings in MSSQLServerDialect.\r\n\r\nError seen when writing table\r\n\r\n(JDBC Write failed,com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: Column, parameter, or variable #2: Cannot find data type BYTE.)\r\ncom.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: Column, parameter, or variable #2: Cannot find data type BYTE.\r\ncom.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException.makeFromDatabaseError(SQLServerException.java:254)\r\ncom.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerStatement.getNextResult(SQLServerStatement.java:1608)\r\ncom.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerStatement.doExecuteStatement(SQLServerStatement.java:859)\r\n ..\r\n\r\n###ShortType and FloatType issue\r\nShortType and FloatTypes are not correctly mapped to right JDBC types when using JDBC connector. This results in tables and spark data frame being created with unintended types.\r\n\r\nSome example issue\r\n\r\nWrite from df with column type results in a SQL table of with column type as INTEGER as opposed to SMALLINT. Thus a larger table that expected.\r\nread results in a dataframe with type INTEGER as opposed to ShortType\r\n\r\nFloatTypes have a issue with read path. In the write path Spark data type 'FloatType' is correctly mapped to JDBC equivalent data type 'Real'. But in the read path when JDBC data types need to be converted to Catalyst data types ( getCatalystType) 'Real' gets incorrectly gets mapped to 'DoubleType' rather than 'FloatType'.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n(MsSqlServerDialect.scala ) BYTETYPE  is mapped to \"TINYINT\", SHORTTYPE is mapped to small int\r\n(JdbcUtils.scala) reading ByteTYPE is added to makeGetter to enable reading after ByteType is translated to TINYINT.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test - Added and passed.\r\nIntegration Test - Tested end to end with SQLServer using JDBC connector.\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. E.g. unit tests, integration tests, manual tests)\r\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screenshot; otherwise, remove this)\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere are \"unsafe\" conversions in the Kafka connector.\r\n`CaseInsensitiveStringMap` comes in which is then converted the following way:\r\n```\r\n...\r\noptions.asScala.toMap\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThe main problem with this is that such case it looses its case insensitive nature\r\n(case insensitive map is converting the key to lower case when get/contains called).\r\n\r\nIn this PR I'm using `CaseInsensitiveMap` to solve this problem.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting + additional unit

is a rough first cut of a Pandas Udf cogroup implementation.  Currently implemented is:\r\n\r\n-  JVM serialisation for interleaved dataframes.\r\n-  Python deserialisation for interleaved dataframes\r\n-  A skeleton cogroup implementation\r\n\r\nThe code is still pretty rough  with the main caveats being:\r\n\r\n- The data passing is pretty minimal (e.g. it only supports exactly two dataframes, there's no ability distinguish on the python side between key and value columns etc)\r\n- The cogroup implementation doesn't work properly in the case of grouping by a string as attribute resolution fails.\r\n\r\nAt this point I think I'd like to focus

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is very like #23590 .\r\n\r\n`ByteBuffer.allocate` may throw `OutOfMemoryError` when the response is large but no enough memory is available. However, when this happens, `TransportClient.sendRpcSync` will just hang forever if the timeout set to unlimited.\r\n\r\nThis PR catches `Throwable` and uses the error to complete `SettableFuture`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI tested in my IDE by setting the value of size to -1 to verify the result. Without this patch, it won't be finished until timeout (May hang forever if timeout set to MAX_INT), or the expected `IllegalArgumentException` will be caught.\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\n      public

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe issue is when self-join a cached view, only one side of join uses cached relation. The cause is in `ResolveReferences` we do deduplicate for a view to have new output attributes. Then in `AliasViewChild`, the rule adds extra project under a view. So it breaks cache matching.\r\n\r\nThe fix is when dedup, we only dedup a view which has output different to its child plan. Otherwise, we dedup on the view's child plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval df = Seq.tabulate(5) { x => (x, x + 1, x + 2, x + 3) }.toDF(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\",

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAt Spark 2.4.0/2.3.2/2.2.3, [SPARK-24948](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24948) delegated access permission checks to the file system, and maintains a permanent blacklist for all event log files failed once at reading. Although this reduces a lot of invalid accesses, there is no way to see this log files back after the permissions are recovered correctly.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use `AtomicReference` so that parent and child threads can access to the same file block holder.\r\n\r\nPython UDF expressions are turned to a plan and then it launches a separate thread to consume the input iterator. In the separate child thread, the iterator sets `InputFileBlockHolder.set` before the parent does which the parent thread is unable to read later.\r\n\r\n1. In this separate child thread, if it happens to call `InputFileBlockHolder.set` first without initialization of the parent's thread local (which is done when the `ThreadLocal.get()` is first called), the child thread seems calling its own `initialValue` to initialize.\r\n\r\n2. After that, the parent calls its own `initialValue` to initializes at the first call of `ThreadLocal.get()`.\r\n\r\n3. Both now have two different references. Updating at child isn't reflected to parent.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it via initializing parent's thread local with `AtomicReference` for file status so that they can be used in each task, and children thread's update is reflected.\r\n\r\nI also tried to explain this a bit more at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24958#discussion_r297203041.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested and unittest was added.\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-25T04:42:21Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:19:38Z","closed_at":"2019-07-31T14:45:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8d95683724b1851226f8d39bdbaf642f13ebb8b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406590181,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTkwMTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYSPARK","name":"PYSPARK","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24958/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24958/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24958/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cb4cfdee34b02d3be7372eeb972c7908b63469d5","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-28153","ref":"SPARK-28153","sha":"cb4cfdee34b02d3be7372eeb972c7908b63469d5","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the predicate pushdown logic in catalyst optimizer more efficient by unifying two existing rules `PushdownPredicates` and `PushPredicateThroughJoin`. Previously pushing down a predicate for queries such as `Filter(Join(Join(Join)))` requires n steps. This patch essentially reduces this to a single pass.\r\n\r\nTo make this actually work, we need to unify a few rules such as `CombineFilters`, `PushDownPredicate` and `PushDownPrdicateThroughJoin`. Otherwise cases such as `Filter(Join(Filter(Join)))` still requires several passes to fully push down predicates. This unification is done by composing several partial functions, which makes a minimal code change and can reuse existing UTs.\r\n\r\nResults show that this optimization can improve the catalyst optimization time by 16.5%. For queries with more joins, the performance is even better. E.g., for TPC-DS q64, the performance boost is 49.2%.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting UTs + new a UT for the new rule.\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-25T01:57:54Z","updated_at":"2019-07-20T16:14:59Z","closed_at":"2019-07-03T16:05:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d0fa18d917b3c22116ded146833cca2e5cf52d37","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24956/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24956/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24956/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dda6df3f5d4f3a5a22df2c0e2e9798f673c751da","head":{"label":"yeshengm:fixed-point-opt","ref":"fixed-point-opt","sha":"dda6df3f5d4f3a5a22df2c0e2e9798f673c751da","user":{"login":"yeshengm","id":12269969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY5OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12269969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm","html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187889692,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc4ODk2OTI=","name":"spark","full_name":"yeshengm/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yeshengm","id":12269969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY5OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12269969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm","html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the input `DataFrame` schema must contain only the information that's required for the matrix object, so a vector column in the case of `RowMatrix` and long and vector columns for `IndexedRowMatrix`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests that verify:\r\n- `RowMatrix` and `IndexedRowMatrix` can be created from `DataFrame`s\r\n- If the schema does not match expectations, we throw an `IllegalArgumentException`\r\n\r\nPlease review https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe changed our non-standard syntax for `trim` function  in #24902 from `TRIM(trimStr, str)` to `TRIM(str, trimStr)` to be compatible with other databases. This pr update the migration guide.\r\n\r\nI checked various databases(PostgreSQL, Teradata, Vertica, Oracle, DB2, SQL Server 2019, MySQL, Hive, Presto) and it seems that only PostgreSQL and Presto support this non-standard syntax.\r\n**PostgreSQL**:\r\n```sql\r\npostgres=#  select substr(version(), 0, 16), trim('yxTomxx', 'x');\r\n     substr      | btrim\r\n-----------------+-------\r\n
