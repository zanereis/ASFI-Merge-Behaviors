**Issue:**\r\nCurrently Google Cloud Transfer Service operators `CloudDataTransferServiceGCSToGCSOperator` and `CloudDataTransferServiceS3ToGCSOperator` don't provide functionality to specify destination path, i.e. prefix for transferred objects, hence all the objects should simply land into the root of the bucket.  \r\n\r\n### **Solution:**\r\n[The Storage Transfer Service allows to specify prefix for transferred objects](https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/reference/rest/v1/TransferSpec#GcsData), the PR adds this functionality with a new input parameter for operators above.\r\n\r\nBy default it'd be `None`, so transferred objects will still land into the root of a bucket.\r\n\r\nIdeally I'd like to use just a single input parameter for specifying destination location, similar as it's done for [`S3ToGCSOperator`](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/transfers/s3_to_gcs.py), parsing GCS URL, but it'd break backward compatibility for already existing pipelines. Hence, adding a new input parameter seems a more reasonable solution.\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code change, Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License

celery cli provides a nice interface to launch workers and stop them. This cli setup works very well when there is one worker running on node without a custom PID specified. But if a worker is launched with custom `--pid` file then `airflow celery stop` command is not capable of stopping the worker. In our setup, we run multiple workers on same node subscribed to different queues. The only way to stop worker is to provide `SIGTERM`, which isn't always the best strategy as it is not always graceful.\r\n\r\n**Changes made**\r\nAdd an additional argument to the `airflow celery stop` command, `--pid`. If this argument is present then the cli will kill worker associated with pid present in specified pidfile.\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-28T00:46:10Z","updated_at":"2021-08-01T06:16:17Z","closed_at":"2021-07-30T04:36:52Z","merged_at":"2021-07-30T04:36:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"b814a58edbf6cad9c7bcc8375c544f35c40ccc97","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1672279581,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjcyMjc5NTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:CLI","name":"area:CLI","color":"e99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/17278/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/17278/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/17278/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/e5c210f022b38da7c139417f8bb4522ff5d80e67","head":{"label":"santosh-d3vpl3x:main","ref":"main","sha":"e5c210f022b38da7c139417f8bb4522ff5d80e67","user":{"login":"santosh-d3vpl3x","id":3813695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTM2OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3813695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/santosh-d3vpl3x","html_url":"https://github.com/santosh-d3vpl3x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santosh-d3vpl3x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santosh-d3vpl3x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santosh-d3vpl3x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santosh-d3vpl3x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santosh-d3vpl3x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santosh-d3vpl3x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santosh-d3vpl3x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santosh-d3vpl3x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/santosh-d3vpl3x/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:main","ref":"main","sha":"7b10b56a67ff935f28197e1916972b29398f667e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

It doesn't have any job_id but instead an id attribute. \r\nThis is not consistent with other Operator (DataflowCreatePythonJobOperator and DataflowCreateJavaJobOperator) and consequently the dag example for dataflow job status sensor doesn't work when using DataflowTemplatedJobStartOperator (or DataflowStartSqlJobOperator or DataflowStartFlexTemplateOperator) before the sensor --> generating an error (see issue #17180)\r\nTo make the dag example working, the XCOM return_value attribute \"id\" has to be used in the dag example instead of \"job_id\".\r\nOr more simply the return value of

#17235\r\n\r\nAdding logic to handle connection parameters added to the classic `Extra` fields as well as part of custom fields which use `Extra` under the hood.  Currently if parameters are added to the classic `Extra` field, they are overwritten by values in custom fields.\r\n\r\nThis PR will combine \"extras\" from both types, if applicable, so existing hooks can still use the `Extra` field within connections if needed.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a flash error is displayed if the value in the classic `Extra` field is not valid JSON.  The connection entry is still created however but without the values in the `Extra` field.

#17032 \r\n\r\n`BigQueryInsertJobOperator` requires the specification of a configuration dict but, at present, this results in poor SQL rendering; especially if the queries are big or complex.\r\n\r\n### Current Example\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1670\" alt=\"125806943-839d57a9-d4a0-492d-b130-06432b095239\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/967119/127119136-3d6f1f57-c941-4b06-b3f3-c6094b31f821.png\">\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to implement the capability for specific elements of a dictionary provided to an operator to be rendered individually with the appropriate renderer.\r\n\r\nFor example, when the following configuration is submitted to `BigQueryInsertJobOperator` then, in addition to the JSON rendering of `configuration` the provided SQL should be separately rendered.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsql = '''\r\nINSERT INTO `target_project.target_dataset.target_table`\r\n(col1, col2, col3, col4)\r\nSELECT col1, col2, col3, col4\r\nFROM `source_project.source_dataset.source_table`\r\n'''\r\n\r\ntest = BigQueryInsertJobOperator(\r\n    task_id='test',\r\n    gcp_conn_id='my_gcp_connection',\r\n    configuration={\"query\": {\"query\": sql,\r\n                             \"destinationTable\": {\"projectId\": 'my_project',\r\n                                                  \"datasetId\": 'my_dataset',\r\n                                                  \"tableId\": 'my_table'},\r\n                             \"writeDisposition\": 'WRITE_TRUNCATE',\r\n                             \"useLegacySql\": False}\r\n                   }\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo achieve it, this PR enables any operator to receive a dot-separated path from `template_field_renderers` along with the renderer type.  In this case we want `BigQueryInsertJobOperator` to extract the value from `configuration` dict where the key path is `query.query`.  This is fully represented as follows:\r\n\r\n `template_fields_renderers = {\"configuration\": \"json\", \"configuration.query.query\": \"sql\"}`\r\n\r\nWhen building the rendered page, we check if the content is a dict - e.g. `configuration` - then, if so, return a generator object that yields every possible path of keys (`get_key_paths`) in the form `key1.key2.key3...keyX`. \r\n\r\nUsing this we can then check to see if any of these paths match with what we have in `template_field_renderers` and, if so, what the renderer is.  If it is a valid renderer then we can use that path to retrieve the value from the configuration (`get_value_from_path`).\r\n\r\n```\r\nif isinstance(content, dict):\r\n    for dict_keys in get_key_paths(content):\r\n        template_path = '.'.join((template_field, dict_keys))\r\n        renderer = task.template_fields_renderers.get(template_path, template_path)\r\n        if renderer in renderers:\r\n            content_value = get_value_from_path(dict_keys, content)\r\n            html_dict[template_path] = renderers[renderer](content_value)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result of this is a rendered page which looks like the following:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1670\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-07-26 at 14 51 48\"

default, when generating a task instance, `DockerOperator` will create a new temporary directory and mount it to the Docker temporary directory. But in the Airflow version `2.1`, `DockerOperator` uses `mounts` instead of `volumes`  attributes to mount that temporary directory. With the `mounts` attribute, the Docker engine does not automatically create a new directory if its path does not exist in the Docker host, but generates an error.\r\nHere is the doc:

change addresses the below mentioned issues:\r\n1. Currently, the `PostgresOperator` logs the sql twice (once by `execute` method of operator and once by the underlying `run()` method of `DbApiHook`). For anyone looking at the logs, it appears the SQL ran twice which is not the case. Here's an example log file:\r\n```log\r\n[2021-07-25 00:01:02,825] {logging_mixin.py:112} INFO - Running <TaskInstance: example_dag.example_task 2021-07-24T04:00:00+00:00 [running]> on host 12345567\r\n[2021-07-25 00:01:02,848] {postgres.py:69} INFO - Executing: truncate table XYZ;\r\n[2021-07-25 00:01:02,857] {base_hook.py:89} INFO - Using connection to: id: app_db.

The `copy_expert` method of `PostgresHook` doesn't currently log the SQL executed against the db. This is helpful for debugging especially if you are calling `copy_expert` method directly as opposed to via `bulk_load` or `bulk_dump`.","created_at":"2021-07-25T21:34:55Z","updated_at":"2021-07-27T17:28:38Z","closed_at":"2021-07-27T07:50:40Z","merged_at":"2021-07-27T07:50:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"e0a41971a1c57221a5e03c70fc670a4c09f19d8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2458345138,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDU4MzQ1MTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/okay%20to%20merge","name":"okay

it failed was:\r\n`This task is not in success state {<huge JSON from AWS containing all the ECS task details>}`\r\n\r\n**Now:**\r\nThe message is:\r\n```\r\nThis task is not in success state - last

of the problem:**\r\nCurrently the celery `task_id` is being stored only after a scheduler launched a task in its executor.\r\nThen the celery `task_id` is being put on the `event_buffer` and the scheduler periodically reads out the `event_buffer` and stores the `external_executor_id`. \r\nBecause manually trigger tasks enter the adoption flow -- as their executor instances are only there for the launching of that one specific tasks -- and the `external_executor_id` is not set, they won't get adopted. Instead they get killed. Meaning, any manually triggered task that doesn't have an `external_executor_id` from a previous scheduled run before being launched, might get killed if the adoption routines kicks in while the task is still running.\r\n\r\n**Solution:**\r\nI could imagine two solution:\r\n1. After every manually triggered task, we read the event_buffer and store that in the task instances.\r\n2. Every task that is triggered for Celery Executors automatically stores its `external_executor_id` at the start up of the task.\r\n\r\nI implemented both but found the second version nicer.\r\nI am looking for some feedback so please provide me with any you can think of :)\r\n\r\n**Opened issues that are related:**\r\nrelated:

four field types are supported in Connection Forms:\r\nString, Password, Integer, Boolean.\r\n\r\nPreviously when custom connections tried to use other field\r\ntype, ConnectionForm behaved in a very strange way - the\r\nconnection form reloaded quickly hiding the actual error\r\nand no error was printed making it next to impossible to figure\r\nout the root cause of the problem.\r\n\r\nWith this change, non-supported field types generate Warning\r\nand the Connections that use them are not added to the list of\r\nsupported connections.\r\n\r\nFixes: #17193\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for

discovery:**\r\nI was debugging a bug with the `external_executor_id` Airflow after which this UI bug caught my eye and I got annoyed by it. I figured to fix this one first so my other testing can go a bit smoother :)\r\n\r\n**Description of the problem:**\r\nCurrently there is a BUG inside the Task Instance details (/task) view.\r\nIt loads the TaskInstance by calling `TI(task, execution_date)` and then uses `refresh_from_db()` to refresh many fields that are no filled in yet.\r\nHowever, the assumption is made in that case that it refreshes all values, which it does not.\r\n`external_executor_id` and `queued_by_job_id` are not updated at all and `executor_config` is only instantiated by the original `TI(task, execution_date)` call but also not updated in `refresh_from_db()`.\r\nThis also shows in the UI where these values are always showing None, while the TaskInstance view shows you these values are not None.\r\n\r\n**The changes in the PR:**\r\n1. Changes to the `update_from_db()` method to include the missing three values.\r\n2. A new test that checks we are really updating ALL values in `update_from_db()`\r\n3. Removal of an incorrect comment as we do need the `execution_date` for that view.\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-22T21:10:28Z","updated_at":"2021-07-22T22:25:08Z","closed_at":"2021-07-22T22:25:08Z","merged_at":"2021-07-22T22:25:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"759c76d7a5d23cc6f6ef4f724a1a322d2445bbd2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"turbaszek","id":9528307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9528307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek","html_url":"https://github.com/turbaszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver

#17111\r\n\r\n# Description\r\nThis PR adjusts the google ads hook to support newer versions of the google-ads library. \r\n\r\nBefore this PR google-ads library v7.0.0 was installed, while the latest version is 13.0.0. I presume the reason for this is because google introduced a backwards incompatible change in version 10.0.0.\r\n\r\nThis PR  should make the hook work with google-ads >= 10.0.0, but I have only tested it on the latest 13.0.0 version.\r\n\r\nThe biggest breaking change in the google-ads API was that instead of returning results as native protocol buffers, it's now returning the data in a simpler to use proto-plus format. \r\n\r\nTo ensure backwards compatibility for older operators that use the hook, I made the `search()` method convert the data back into native protocol buffers. In addition to that I added a `search_proto_plus()` method that returns the data in the new proto-plus format.\r\n\r\nYou can get more information about that here:\r\nhttps://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/client-libs/python/library-version-10\r\n\r\n# Other considerations\r\nAs discussed in #17111, google-ads version 12.0.0 is the last version to support python 3.6. The currently latest version 13.0.0 only supports python 3.7.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what the best way is to handle that, but wanted to raise it here so that you can consider it.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\nThis is my first time submitting a pull request for airflow. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don't have a test environment set up. I apologize for that, but since google completely stopped supporting the v5 API and everyone's google ads integrations are broken due to this issue, I decided it may be worth submitting my fix even though I wasn't able to run unit tests on it.\r\n\r\n I did test the changes on my local installation with my operators and dags though.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to adjust anything.","created_at":"2021-07-22T12:04:01Z","updated_at":"2021-07-25T20:55:51Z","closed_at":"2021-07-25T20:55:50Z","merged_at":"2021-07-25T20:55:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"5d2224795b3548516311025d5549094a9b168f3b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"turbaszek","id":9528307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9528307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek","html_url":"https://github.com/turbaszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"vikramkoka","id":25178089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTc4MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25178089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka","html_url":"https://github.com/vikramkoka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

Scheduler, the SchedulerJob was instantiated before demon context was\r\nactivated. SchedulerJob is a database ORM object from SQL Alchemy and it\r\nopens the connection to Postgres:\r\n\r\nWhen you activate daemon context, what happens under the hood is forking\r\nthe process, and while some of the opened sockets were passed to the\r\nforks (stdin and stderr but also the opened log file handle), the\r\nestablished socket for DB connection was not passed.\r\n\r\nAs the result, when scheduler was started with --daemonize flag\r\nthe error `SSL SYSCALL error: Socket operation on non-socket` was\r\nraised.\r\n\r\nThe PR moves SchedulerJob initialization to within the context\r\nwhich makes the connection to Postgres initialized after the\r\nprocess has been forked and daemonized.\r\n\r\nFixes: #17120\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

now upon failure, BashOperator will only raise AirflowException saying there is some non-zero exit code but does NOT specify which non-zero code it is! Consequently, that prevents user from providing specific actions in `on_failure_callback()` w.r.t. different exit codes.\r\n\r\nIn comparison, many other operators or hooks in the repo already include the non-zero exit code in their exception strings, to name a few:\r\n\r\n- [spark_sql.py](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/apache/spark/hooks/spark_sql.py#L194)\r\n- [spark_submit.py](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/apache/spark/hooks/spark_submit.py#L445)\r\n- [azure_container_instances.py](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/microsoft/azure/operators/azure_container_instances.py#L279)\r\n- [dataflow.py](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/hooks/dataflow.py#L1017)\r\n\r\nThis PR simply\r\n\r\n- adds that non-zero exit code to the exception string for BashOperator as well,\r\n- and also updates its unit tests accordingly.

users seem to be using different configs for different components. This doc makes it clear on what we recommend.\r\n\r\nContext: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/16754#issuecomment-884419057\r\n\r\n>I'm new to Airflow and I haven't seen an explicit part within the docs that says \"all configuration must be shared between airflow components\". In fact, all configuration keys are prefixed with some naming scheme which led me to think that some are common, some are for webserver etc... I personally don't like to have common configuration because changing a single setting requires a change in all components (hence restart) but I get that this is intentional for Airflow. I think this can be better communicated throughout the docs.\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @tunix \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

Adds an operator to return a list of prefixes from an S3 bucket\r\n- Updates `list_prefixes()` unit test to assert on a nested dir with a prefix variable\r\n- Removes duplicate calls to `list_keys()` that were in the `test_list_prefixes()` unit test (likely a copy/paste boo boo?)\r\n\r\nThere are two suggestion from [this conversation](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/8464) that I have not included here:\r\n1. Combine or otherwise simplify `s3_list_keys()` and `s3_list_prefixes()` into one - this makes sense to me but I don't quite know how people tend to use these operators or if there is a valid argument for keeping them separate. \r\n\r\n2. Combining all the s3 operators into one file like [gcs.py](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/operators/gcs.py) - this also makes sense to me, but it's not consistent with the other AWS operators. Might be worth opening a new issue to refactor them all if we want to go in this direction?\r\n\r\nIssue Link: #[8448](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/8448) \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/16754 -- it is important that both Webserver and Worker have the same config value for `[webserver] secret_key` or else you will see the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*** Fetching from: https://worker.worker-svc.default.svc.cluster.local:8793/log/<dag>/<task>/2021-07-15T11:51:59.190528+00:00/1.log\r\n*** Failed to fetch log file from worker.

Hence they don't match, resulting in the error.\r\n\r\nThis PR creates a K8s Secret object and creates a key for that setting and pass it as Env Var similar to what we do with Fernet Key.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/13779\r\n\r\nGive a possibility to run `wait_for_pipeline_state` with default or provided parameters, remove unnecessary call inside `start_pipeline` hook.\r\n\r\nWhy I removed `wait_for_pipeline_state`  from `start_pipeline` hook. By this call, I think we have a bug in this operator, for example when we have pipeline which starting more than `300` seconds, so it have a starting status, we get the error because this pipepline is not in correct state after `300` seconds. Even when we pass our parameters `sucess_states` and `pipeline_timeout` we get this error in this case, so I think when I pass both parameters the logic should use them not default. Why we have `300` second and these `SUCCESS_STATES + [PipelineStates.RUNNING]`, because we had these values in the `wait_for_pipeline_state` call which I removed from hook, I think we should replace this 300 second and use default value from `__init__` method (this is a open question I think)\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

all,\r\nDuring the RC tests, I founded this bug (generated from my PR #16365). The bug is present when the user set in `Extra` parameter field in a `Tableau Connection` the parameter `Verify` equals to `false` or `true`. During the JSON parsing, the value is automatically read as `bool`, so the explicit conversion `str` to `bool` is not necessary.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2021-07-21, 07:15:33 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1455} ERROR - Task failed with exception\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/opt/airflow/airflow/models/taskinstance.py\", line 1182, in _run_raw_task\r\n    self._prepare_and_execute_task_with_callbacks(context, task)\r\n  File \"/opt/airflow/airflow/models/taskinstance.py\", line 1285, in _prepare_and_execute_task_with_callbacks\r\n    result = self._execute_task(context, task_copy)\r\n  File \"/opt/airflow/airflow/models/taskinstance.py\", line 1315, in _execute_task\r\n    result = task_copy.execute(context=context)\r\n  File \"/opt/airflow/airflow/providers/tableau/operators/tableau_refresh_workbook.py\", line 70, in execute\r\n    with TableauHook(self.site_id, self.tableau_conn_id) as tableau_hook:\r\n  File \"/opt/airflow/airflow/providers/tableau/hooks/tableau.py\", line 70, in __init__\r\n    verify = bool(strtobool(verify))\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/distutils/util.py\", line 313, in strtobool\r\n    val = val.lower()\r\nAttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'lower'\r\n```\r\n**Code changes:**\r\n\r\n1.

tried renaming `DagRun.execution_date` to `schedule_date` and it produced a plethora of errors everywhere, so I’m taking a less drastic attempt on this.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a `schedule_date` field to the OpenAPI schema, and allow POST-ing a new DagRun with that field (instead of `execution_date`), but not both of them. Both `schedule_date` and `execution_date` fields are present when GET-ing a DagRun.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this is not currently working; I can’t successfully express the above and the POST tests are currently failing to validate. I have very little experience with OpenAPI specification, so I’m creating this as a draft hoping some can provide some advice.\r\n\r\ncc @ephraimbuddy

you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCloses: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/11901\r\nCloses: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/17516\r\n\r\nEnsuring that the active DAGs in the DB are all actually present in their corresponding python files by reconciling the DB state and with the contents of a given DAG file on every parse operation. \r\n\r\nThis _should_ prevent a lot of issues encountered when writing multiple DAGs per-file, renaming DAGs or dynamically generating DAGs based on a config file read at parse-time.\r\n\r\nThis will cause a few other functional changes:\r\n\r\n1) DAGs will disappear from the UI if an ImportError is introduced in the underlying file.\r\n2) DAGs will no longer be re-marked as active if they are inactive / missing but the file is present.\r\n3) DAGs could be incorrectly marked inactive if there's an unexpected parsing error (I guess this is a tradeoff between false-poitives and false-negatives)\r\n\r\n#### Validation:\r\n\r\nI have validated these changes in a local breeze environment with the following DAG:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow.models import DAG\r\nfrom airflow import utils\r\nfrom airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator\r\n\r\nNUM_DAGS=1\r\n\r\ndef message():\r\n    print('Hello, world.')\r\n\r\nfor i in range(NUM_DAGS):\r\n    with DAG(f'dag-{i}', schedule_interval=None, start_date=utils.dates.days_ago(1)) as dag:\r\n        task = PythonOperator(\r\n            task_id='task',\r\n            python_callable=message\r\n        )\r\n        globals()[f\"dag_{i}\"] = dag\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy changing the value of `NUM_DAGS` I can quickly change the number of DAG objects present in this file. \r\n\r\nBefore this change, decreasing the value of `NUM_DAGS` would leave a bunch of stale DAGs in the UI. These could be triggered but would then fail as the executor was not able to load the specified task from the file.\r\n\r\nAfter implementing this change, stale DAGs disappear from the UI shortly after decreasing the value of `NUM_DAGS`.\r\n\r\n#### Questions:\r\n\r\n1. Is there a good reason for Airflow to mark inactive DAGs as active if the file still exists? I looked through the [original PR which introduced this](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5743/files) but couldn't find an explanation.\r\n\r\n2. How significant is the performance hit incurred by updating the DAG table on every parse operation?\r\n \r\n3. Will this change introduce any other functional changes that I haven't mentioned above?\r\n\r\n#### Follow up:\r\n\r\nIf this PR is merged, we should also add some documentation which discusses dynamically generated DAGs, and explains how to generate multiple DAGs in a loop as shown in the example above.","created_at":"2021-07-21T03:04:15Z","updated_at":"2021-09-18T19:52:55Z","closed_at":"2021-09-18T19:52:55Z","merged_at":"2021-09-18T19:52:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"e81f14b85e2609ce0f40081caa90c2a6af1d2c65","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"turbaszek","id":9528307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9528307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek","html_url":"https://github.com/turbaszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including
