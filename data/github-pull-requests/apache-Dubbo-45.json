changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-25T06:02:37Z","updated_at":"2021-05-31T12:33:18Z","closed_at":"2021-05-31T12:33:18Z","merged_at":"2021-05-31T12:33:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"09dcf41208257fa8c9e19edd7fe34fd04f607437","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7331964,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzMxOTY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/type/bug","name":"type/bug","color":"C5DEF5","default":false,"description":"Bugs

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-25T05:03:21Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T09:24:41Z","closed_at":"2021-03-26T09:24:40Z","merged_at":"2021-03-26T09:24:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"57ef177d9a211bcbc7704541450f4f5b9c90394b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7439/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7439/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7439/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/eb119db8ee14441e5b25f066a0a3fbab8dbb55e4","head":{"label":"zonghaishang:fix_null_exception","ref":"fix_null_exception","sha":"eb119db8ee14441e5b25f066a0a3fbab8dbb55e4","user":{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":121260009,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjEyNjAwMDk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"zonghaishang/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang/dubbo","description":"Open

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n初步修复 #7367 的问题\r\n当多处用注解订阅同一个服务，并使用parameters时，如\r\n```\r\n@DubboReference(version = \"2.0\", check = false, parameters = {\"a\", \"1\"})\r\n```\r\n实际会产生多个Reference示例\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1，修复generateReferenceBeanName过程中未处理Array类型的entry问题\r\n2，如果产生多个相同“INTERFACE:VERSION:GROUP”的Reference实例，则在启动日志中增加WARN信息，帮助用户分析\r\n日志示例\r\n```\r\n[25/03/21 07:18:23:790 CST] main  WARN

Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-24T12:20:13Z","updated_at":"2021-07-05T02:22:15Z","closed_at":"2021-04-02T08:07:19Z","merged_at":"2021-04-02T08:07:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"23397290073381c0024706c935072dae457a5742","assignee":{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7438/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7438/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7438/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4eacf5ba066de99e7a912e7ae1dae10524b90ce2","head":{"label":"70-cloud-lab:210324-fix-7367-step-1","ref":"210324-fix-7367-step-1","sha":"4eacf5ba066de99e7a912e7ae1dae10524b90ce2","user":{"login":"70-cloud-lab","id":61860043,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxODYwMDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61860043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab","html_url":"https://github.com/70-cloud-lab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":345975894,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDU5NzU4OTQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"70-cloud-lab/dubbo

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-24T08:48:36Z","updated_at":"2021-03-30T13:28:02Z","closed_at":"2021-03-26T10:58:38Z","merged_at":"2021-03-26T10:58:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"041f8bb0a98a912bd363560d5a2339198dcf79a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7437/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7437/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7437/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ce492979da4e9f3ef28207be30f238bc230893d0","head":{"label":"kevinw66:yaml-safeconstructor","ref":"yaml-safeconstructor","sha":"ce492979da4e9f3ef28207be30f238bc230893d0","user":{"login":"kevinw66","id":31196226,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTk2MjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31196226?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinw66","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":324349848,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjQzNDk4NDg=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kevinw66/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kevinw66","id":31196226,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTk2MjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31196226?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinw66","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kevinw66/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-20T09:33:00Z","updated_at":"2021-05-27T07:09:40Z","closed_at":"2021-05-27T07:03:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"98da0fedd68371e94a1caab85289108b2c4dc561","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741981,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDE5ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/don%E2%80%99t-merge","name":"status/don’t-merge","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":"No

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nApache Dubbo is a Java application and thus should work fine on any architecture supported by the Java Virtual Machine.\r\nBut Dubbo depends on some libraries which use native binaries that do not have aarch64 version, for example embedded-redis and embedded-consul.\r\nThis PR updates those dependencies with newer versions which added support for ARM64 architecture!\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe PR re-introduces TravisCI as a build tool to build and tests `master` branch every night.\r\nThis has been discussed at https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r2742c51066b55787571417ed74843cd9607ba8202566ddd807f9bdab%40%3Cdev.dubbo.apache.org%3E\r\nSomeone from Dubbo team will have to setup the Cron job at TravisCI UI

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-18T10:29:43Z","updated_at":"2021-11-16T12:09:53Z","closed_at":"2021-11-16T12:09:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"84f35dfcbd4e3ac143c3510559c5b02f89e8a366","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-17T15:34:32Z","updated_at":"2021-03-22T00:41:40Z","closed_at":"2021-03-22T00:41:39Z","merged_at":"2021-03-22T00:41:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"da6093048ff2dea04444aa5dc64e5a837bfa8fa0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/36","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/36","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/36/labels","id":5867716,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTg2NzcxNg==","number":36,"title":"2.7.10","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":42,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-11T13:50:28Z","updated_at":"2021-05-06T17:13:26Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2021-05-06T17:13:26Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7400/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7400/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7400/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/cd1f426fb2c40ea225e4008c2ac3fffa40c0937f","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-issue#6484","ref":"up-dev-issue#6484","sha":"cd1f426fb2c40ea225e4008c2ac3fffa40c0937f","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd license to dubbo-migration.yaml \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-17T10:42:01Z","updated_at":"2021-05-31T12:10:37Z","closed_at":"2021-05-31T12:10:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"79637a6961cec8dcfea1d62d82d490ecd24c805d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7395/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7395/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7395/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/72850bdc6dded4ec7aa00c5ae5ea22caa204664f","head":{"label":"70-cloud-lab:issues-7348","ref":"issues-7348","sha":"72850bdc6dded4ec7aa00c5ae5ea22caa204664f","user":{"login":"70-cloud-lab","id":61860043,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxODYwMDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61860043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab","html_url":"https://github.com/70-cloud-lab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":345975894,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDU5NzU4OTQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"70-cloud-lab/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"70-cloud-lab","id":61860043,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxODYwMDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61860043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab","html_url":"https://github.com/70-cloud-lab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/70-cloud-lab/dubbo","description":"Apache

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-17T02:54:09Z","updated_at":"2023-10-12T05:41:11Z","closed_at":"2021-03-17T03:08:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7cd62c622069b281c6e311edb02bd4f9387132d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7389/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7389/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7389/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f7fe8707b975836314c23da7bd5feb9c6831d1ae","head":{"label":"tangyuewei:master","ref":"master","sha":"f7fe8707b975836314c23da7bd5feb9c6831d1ae","user":{"login":"tangyuewei","id":25164780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTY0Nzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25164780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangyuewei","html_url":"https://github.com/tangyuewei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangyuewei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangyuewei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangyuewei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangyuewei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangyuewei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangyuewei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangyuewei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangyuewei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tangyuewei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"af0dcc14d8126dae361e8ef95f33392d27dd3df9","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-16T13:22:43Z","updated_at":"2021-04-13T06:31:57Z","closed_at":"2021-04-13T06:31:57Z","merged_at":"2021-04-13T06:31:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"8e5eac1acff7fa987dd3a2b4dfaaa5137b673f1d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7386/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7386/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7386/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/469a7c3bd1e327c68d567551e4fa9a77f980d055","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-3.0-issue#6742","ref":"up-3.0-issue#6742","sha":"469a7c3bd1e327c68d567551e4fa9a77f980d055","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRefactor  dubbo reference processing, include spring xml and `@DubboReference` annotation. \r\n\r\n* Solve the problem of property injection failure caused by early initialization of ReferenceBean\r\n* Fix the problem that the ReferenceBean created by `@DubboReference` may fail to be injected\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nThe main initialization process:\r\n1. Parse the <dubbo:reference /> in spring xml and register it as beanDefinition\r\nOr\r\nParse @DubboReference annotation to register ReferenceBean instance\r\n\r\n2. Create lazy init proxy when ReferenceBean is initialized\r\n\r\n3. Load PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer or PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer\r\n\r\n4. Initialize dubbo config beans in DubboConfigInitializationPostProcessor\r\n\r\n5. Solve the ${..} placeholder in ReferenceBeanManager and create an instance of ReferenceConfig\r\n\r\n6. Start DubboBootstrap\r\n\r\nPolish/improved pull requests:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/7402\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/7405\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/7412\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nRun dubbo unit-tests and dubbo-samples integration tests.\r\n\r\n**Related issues of property injection failure**:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/6035\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dubbo-spring-boot-project/issues/695\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/6722\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/6543\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/6079\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/6139\r\n\r\n**Related issues of `@DubboReference` injection**: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/6000\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/6030\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/7003\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/7413\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/3902\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-16T10:02:12Z","updated_at":"2021-06-28T07:37:28Z","closed_at":"2021-03-17T11:42:42Z","merged_at":"2021-03-17T11:42:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"fc731156ed2cf0e4b6a6d60d333782200dfdc897","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7383/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7383/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7383/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/269120284751568c630a981976f1924f91aa6503","head":{"label":"kylixs:3.0_reference_refactor","ref":"3.0_reference_refactor","sha":"269120284751568c630a981976f1924f91aa6503","user":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":305677990,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDU2Nzc5OTA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kylixs/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-16T06:07:54Z","updated_at":"2021-10-27T11:47:37Z","closed_at":"2021-10-27T11:47:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"52cbadbd8d933cc127907b80f22f498eae5f4883","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7379/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7379/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7379/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8bb9a4fe06f94fd192be75737359b9cc6f3bbd4f","head":{"label":"sourirer:remove_consumer_metadatareport","ref":"remove_consumer_metadatareport","sha":"8bb9a4fe06f94fd192be75737359b9cc6f3bbd4f","user":{"login":"sourirer","id":12392734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzkyNzM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12392734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourirer","html_url":"https://github.com/sourirer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourirer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourirer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourirer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourirer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourirer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourirer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourirer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourirer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourirer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":337317965,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzczMTc5NjU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"sourirer/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sourirer","id":12392734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzkyNzM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12392734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourirer","html_url":"https://github.com/sourirer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourirer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourirer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourirer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourirer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourirer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourirer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourirer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourirer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourirer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sourirer/dubbo","description":"Apache

arguments router logic to ConditionRouter.\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd arguments router to ConditionRouter.\r\nCompatible to current ConditionRouter logic.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nAdd arguments router to ConditionRouter\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdd arguments router to ConditionRouter\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\nIn some cases, we need to choose the right provider while the arguments of the method is setted.\r\nThe condition rule is like\r\n\r\n> arguments[1].str!=b  => host = 1.1.1.1\r\n\r\nWhile the str property of the second argument is equal to b, the providers whose host is equal to 1.1.1.1 are to be choosed。\r\nWe could use this feature to route requests according to business params. \r\nThe feature is compatible to current ConditionRouter logic.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-16T02:41:32Z","updated_at":"2021-04-21T13:12:50Z","closed_at":"2021-04-21T13:12:50Z","merged_at":"2021-04-21T13:12:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"6e0996654f488ebb9e476a2fb11e853fdb908e30","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7378/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7378/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7378/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/89328bec7920036cf99f293c7906655cccb4bffe","head":{"label":"furaul:feature/20210316_arguments_condition_router","ref":"feature/20210316_arguments_condition_router","sha":"89328bec7920036cf99f293c7906655cccb4bffe","user":{"login":"furaul","id":4946739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NDY3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4946739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/furaul","html_url":"https://github.com/furaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":347919597,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDc5MTk1OTc=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"furaul/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"furaul","id":4946739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NDY3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4946739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/furaul","html_url":"https://github.com/furaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/furaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/furaul/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-11T06:58:34Z","updated_at":"2021-03-11T08:53:48Z","closed_at":"2021-03-11T08:53:48Z","merged_at":"2021-03-11T08:53:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"0298ec0fd3eacd991c00cd1c4f3239d7e573437d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7361/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7361/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7361/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d358daf10cc86c6dc2aab6c026a7dfb4ca66ca5c","head":{"label":"guohao:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"d358daf10cc86c6dc2aab6c026a7dfb4ca66ca5c","user":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":343317923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDMzMTc5MjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"guohao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guohao/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nto fix something wrong with MergeableClusterInvoker#7359\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nAs MergeableClusterInvoker was used, when 'resultList.size() == 1', there would be an error msg \"AppResponse represents an concrete business response, there will be no status changes, you should get internal values directly.\" The reason is that the resultType would be \"AppResponse\", in org.apache.dubbo.rpc.cluster.support.wrapper.AbstractCluster.InterceptorInvokerNode#invoke method's \"return clause\" the exception would be thrown. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-10T14:33:16Z","updated_at":"2021-03-11T14:42:37Z","closed_at":"2021-03-11T14:42:37Z","merged_at":"2021-03-11T14:42:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"a5887235f9a40b9bad4ac8c257db5511b80448ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7360/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7360/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7360/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/df39d9ab32d445f60e978ff8be6b1ea8a4d7bb93","head":{"label":"zhangxin1932:master","ref":"master","sha":"df39d9ab32d445f60e978ff8be6b1ea8a4d7bb93","user":{"login":"zhangxin1932","id":32886647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODg2NjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32886647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxin1932","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangxin1932","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxin1932/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxin1932/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxin1932/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxin1932/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxin1932/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxin1932/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxin1932/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxin1932/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxin1932/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":346358622,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDYzNTg2MjI=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"zhangxin1932/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhangxin1932","id":32886647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODg2NjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32886647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxin1932","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangxin1932","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxin1932/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxin1932/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxin1932/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxin1932/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxin1932/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxin1932/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxin1932/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxin1932/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxin1932/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhangxin1932/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-10T13:05:23Z","updated_at":"2021-03-22T07:13:10Z","closed_at":"2021-03-22T07:13:09Z","merged_at":"2021-03-22T07:13:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"7dd685520327bd4dc6addf29e3aeb697971ef5d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7358/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7358/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7358/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b7812a1fe169c1833d2ad3d17e4642399632b6ae","head":{"label":"zonghaishang:refactor_codes","ref":"refactor_codes","sha":"b7812a1fe169c1833d2ad3d17e4642399632b6ae","user":{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":121260009,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjEyNjAwMDk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"zonghaishang/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang/dubbo","description":"Open

this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-09T11:54:01Z","updated_at":"2021-03-10T13:38:40Z","closed_at":"2021-03-10T13:38:40Z","merged_at":"2021-03-10T13:38:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"e943af042f2204373c4af85d55dd2a6cf50750ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7352/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7352/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7352/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6f568af76eb94319a85e5de901895fb56785b94b","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-issue#7351","ref":"up-dev-issue#7351","sha":"6f568af76eb94319a85e5de901895fb56785b94b","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\n当提供者、消费者配置多个按节点服务发现的注册中心后，实际生成的ServiceInstancesChangedListener数量与AbstractEventDispatcher#listenersCache不符合。同时提供者下线时，部分ServiceInstancesChangedListener未触发onEvent()。\r\n\r\n分析：addEventListener时，会通过Collection.contains(element)判断listenersCache中是否已存在ServiceInstancesChangedListener，contains()内使用ServiceInstancesChangedListener.equals()。此equals()方法只计算了serviceNames，导致无法识别多个注册中心不同的ServiceInstancesChangedListener。\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n* Dubbo version: maste(2.7.10-SNAPSHOT)\r\n* Operating System version: ANY\r\n* Java version: 1.8\r\n\r\n### 示例demo\r\nhttps://github.com/70-cloud-lab/dubbo-issues/tree/main/210309-event-was-override\r\n\r\n备注\r\n示例运行需要在AbstractEventDispatcher中补充listenersCache的get方法\r\n```\r\n    public ConcurrentMap<Class<? extends Event>, List<EventListener>> getListenersCache() {\r\n        return listenersCache;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n根据ServiceInstancesChangedListener的设计，应该是需要区分不同的serviceDiscovery，而一个serviceDiscovery其实对应了一个注册中心。因此将serviceDiscovery纳入equals()、hashCode()计算。\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-09T11:27:27Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T14:01:15Z","closed_at":"2021-03-26T14:01:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2a1aebc684f5a079e747fbe09027602b7a9a59d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7350/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7350/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7350/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7efa4e5e21c1e8ac3078fc58121e5facd0914320","head":{"label":"70-cloud-lab:210309-event-was-override","ref":"210309-event-was-override","sha":"7efa4e5e21c1e8ac3078fc58121e5facd0914320","user":{"login":"70-cloud-lab","id":61860043,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxODYwMDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61860043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab","html_url":"https://github.com/70-cloud-lab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":345975894,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDU5NzU4OTQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"70-cloud-lab/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"70-cloud-lab","id":61860043,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxODYwMDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61860043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab","html_url":"https://github.com/70-cloud-lab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/70-cloud-lab/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-07T08:53:57Z","updated_at":"2021-03-07T09:23:47Z","closed_at":"2021-03-07T09:23:47Z","merged_at":"2021-03-07T09:23:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"e0cba81952bc96cb0994552cd0cfc8e50296fca9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7337/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7337/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7337/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9c2cf9c5f479842e291ca1b99ed08938fe093f6c","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev3.0-issue#7024","ref":"up-dev3.0-issue#7024","sha":"9c2cf9c5f479842e291ca1b99ed08938fe093f6c","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-05T09:19:27Z","updated_at":"2021-03-05T09:56:56Z","closed_at":"2021-03-05T09:56:56Z","merged_at":"2021-03-05T09:56:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"8c24a48d56ad5011ad596b7e27606bf680909b2b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7329/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7329/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7329/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ef4eb75bacf8061426056f0f198368f344fc862e","head":{"label":"guohao:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"ef4eb75bacf8061426056f0f198368f344fc862e","user":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":343317923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDMzMTc5MjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"guohao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guohao/dubbo","description":"Apache

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-04T11:51:28Z","updated_at":"2021-04-11T12:23:15Z","closed_at":"2021-04-11T12:23:15Z","merged_at":"2021-04-11T12:23:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"a10d7f343c4bde1ebdf06170f65a3846d697b2ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7326/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7326/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7326/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f535a6c5987873daa85a77a3187e8261a0767c78","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-issue#7176","ref":"up-dev-issue#7176","sha":"f535a6c5987873daa85a77a3187e8261a0767c78","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-03T06:26:35Z","updated_at":"2021-03-03T07:47:12Z","closed_at":"2021-03-03T07:47:12Z","merged_at":"2021-03-03T07:47:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"346cd716d3672d8a192ca1002a6ac596f9e9070d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7307/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7307/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7307/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e6792895e3c7385793f1ecea459ba9a1bc3d9602","head":{"label":"guohao:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"e6792895e3c7385793f1ecea459ba9a1bc3d9602","user":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":343317923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDMzMTc5MjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"guohao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guohao/dubbo","description":"Apache
