for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of the `replaceWithAliases` method in `NestedColumnAliasing` replaces the children of the current plan with mapped aliases.

The `renameTable` method should keep the catalog name in `TableIdentifier`. This is necessary as methods like `getTablesByName` won't qualifier the table identifiers again.\r\n\r\nThis PR also cleans up `InMemoryCatalog` a bit. The caller side `SessionCatalog` will create tables/functions using qualified identifiers with catalog name, and we don't need to attach catalog name again in places like `getTable`. We just need to make sure we don't drop the catalog field during table updating.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr remove redundant imports of `immutable.Map` and and `immutable.Set`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn `library/scala/Predef.scala`,  `scala.Map[K, +V]` is predefined as `immutable.Map[K, V]`, and `scala.Set[A]` is predefined as `immutable.Set[A]`, so no need to explicitly imports when there is no

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Replace `Option[QueryContext]` by `Array[QueryContext]` in Spark exceptions like in `SparkRuntimeException`.\r\n2. Pass `SQLQueryContext` to `QueryExecutionErrors` functions instead of `Option[SQLQueryContext]`.\r\n3. Add the methods `getContextOrNull()` and `getContextOrNullCode()` to `SupportQueryContext` to get a SQL query context or `null` (if it is missed) of an expression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. The changes will allow to chain multiple error contexts in Spark's exception. For instance, if user's query refers a view v1, v1 refers another view v2, and v2 does a division. The error contexts will be: sql fragment of v2 that does division -> sql fragment of v1 that refers v2 -> sql fragment of your query that refers v1.\r\n2. Passing `SQLQueryContext` to `QueryExecutionErrors` directly simplifies codegen code because it allows to avoid construction of Scala objects like `scala.None`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this PR changes user-facing exceptions.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DecimalExpressionSuite\"\r\n```\r\nand potentially affected tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2022-07-29T09:00:03Z","updated_at":"2022-08-01T08:40:30Z","closed_at":"2022-08-01T08:40:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"322048a790c145e94b796abb24a46acab279fecb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37343/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37343/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37343/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b926386fce8269e51c89692185b6ca55cc55cd51","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:array-as-query-context","ref":"array-as-query-context","sha":"b926386fce8269e51c89692185b6ca55cc55cd51","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr add a micro-benchmark for `o.a.spark.util.Utils#getIteratorSize` method.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/82cd993244656153551c9bb122247789d2a5b6b4/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/util/Utils.scala#L1910-L1915\r\n\r\nFrom the method comments, `Utils#getIteratorSize` method was added due to `scala.collection.Iterator#size` uses a for loop and it is slightly slower in the current version of Scala.\r\n\r\n  When adding this method, Spark uses Scala 2.10. Currently, Spark use Scala 2.12. this pr add introduce `IteratorSizeBenchmark` to ensure that the conclusion is still correct when upgrading the major version of Scala, otherwise we should use `Iterator#size` directly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, just for test \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSimilar with https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37313, currently, when  arithmetic overflow errors happen under ANSI mode, the error messages are like\r\n```\r\n[ARITHMETIC_OVERFLOW] long overflow. Use 'try_multiply' to tolerate overflow and return NULL instead. If necessary set spark.sql.ansi.enabled to \"false\" \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"(except for ANSI interval type)\" part is confusing. We should remove it for the numeric arithmetic operations and have a new error class for the interval division error: `INTERVAL_ARITHMETIC_OVERFLOW`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor better error messages\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, Use different error classes for arithmetic overflows of numeric/interval.. After changes, the error messages are simpler and more clear.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT","created_at":"2022-07-29T04:51:41Z","updated_at":"2022-08-01T21:14:00Z","closed_at":"2022-08-01T17:37:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fe7bc869a8d10d7b0e432ed9fdd8192594630a27","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37337/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37337/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37337/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/aebb81e4063bef2def9803aba7ef4c6b94515045","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:improveOverflowMsg","ref":"improveOverflowMsg","sha":"aebb81e4063bef2def9803aba7ef4c6b94515045","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPyspark dataframe drop has following signature:\r\n`def drop(self, *cols: \"ColumnOrName\") -> \"DataFrame\":`\r\n\r\nHowever when we try to pass multiple Column types to drop function it raises TypeError\r\n\r\n`each col in the param list should be a string`\r\n\r\n*Minimal reproducible example:*\r\n```python\r\nvalues = [(\"id_1\", 5, 9), (\"id_2\", 5, 1), (\"id_3\", 4, 3), (\"id_1\", 3, 3), (\"id_2\", 4, 3)]\r\ndf = spark.createDataFrame(values, \"id string, point int, count int\")\r\ndf.drop(df.point, df.count)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt spits out following:\r\n```\r\n/spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/sql/dataframe.py in drop(self, *cols)\r\n2537 for col in cols:\r\n2538 if not isinstance(col, str):\r\n-> 2539 raise TypeError(\"each col in the param list should be a string\")\r\n2540 jdf = self._jdf.drop(self._jseq(cols))\r\n2541\r\n\r\nTypeError: each col in the param list should be a string\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe expect that multiple columns can be handled by drop call on df because of its typing but that is not the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nKeep the output attributes of a `Union` node's first child in the `RemoveRedundantAliases` rule to avoid correctness issues.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the result of the following query:\r\n```\r\nSELECT a, b AS a FROM (\r\n  SELECT a, a AS b FROM (SELECT a FROM VALUES (1) AS t(a))\r\n  UNION ALL\r\n  SELECT a, b FROM (SELECT a, b FROM VALUES (1, 2) AS t(a, b))\r\n)\r\n```\r\nBefore this PR the query returns the incorrect result: \r\n```\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  a|  a|\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  1|  1|\r\n|  2|  2|\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\nAfter this PR it returns the expected result:\r\n```\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  a|  a|\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  1|  1|\r\n|  1|  2|\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, fixes a correctness issue.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36871. \r\n\r\nPR renames `inferDate` to `prefersDate` to avoid confusion when dates inference would change the column type and result in confusion when the user meant to infer timestamps. \r\n\r\nThe patch also updates semantics of the option: `prefersDate` is allowed to be used during schema inference (`inferSchema`) as well as user-provided schema where it could be used as a fallback mechanism when parsing timestamps.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes ambiguity when setting `prefersDate` to true and clarifies semantics of the option.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAlthough it is an option rename, the original PR was merged a few days ago and the config option has not been included in a Spark release.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI added a unit test for prefersDate = true with a user

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn this PR, we propose to add a method \"String name()\" to the Scan interface, that \"BatchScanExec\" can invoke to set the node name of the plan. This nodeName will be eventually used by \"SparkPlanGraphNode\" to display it in the header of the UI node.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSince for DSv2, the scan node in the spark plan on SparkUI simply shows \"BatchScan\" instead of an informative name.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, after this change the user will be able to see the scan name in the spark plan on SparkUI.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n- Tested this change using existing UTs\r\n- Further tested this change by overriding the newly added method in Iceberg's implementation of the Scan

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to pass `messageParameters` to `AnalysisException` from `InvalidUDFClassException`.\r\n\r\nAlso, I propose to replace `checkErrorClass` by `checkError` in the test \"NO_HANDLER_FOR_UDAF: No handler for UDAF error\" to check that the message parameters are passed correctly, and make the test independent from the message of the error class `NO_HANDLER_FOR_UDAF`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix a bug and provide actual message parameters to users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, users receive non-empty message parameters.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *QueryCompilationErrorsSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2022-07-27T18:53:10Z","updated_at":"2022-07-28T04:44:56Z","closed_at":"2022-07-28T04:44:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f857f154931c85cbd19fdff4c8753410a6844513","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37323/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37323/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37323/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6c900cd2e70efb8753f0d283f5ed77dd698fc81e","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:override-getMessageParameters","ref":"override-getMessageParameters","sha":"6c900cd2e70efb8753f0d283f5ed77dd698fc81e","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, when numbers are divided by 0 under ANSI mode, the error message is like\r\n```\r\n[DIVIDE_BY_ZERO] Division by zero. Use `try_divide` to tolerate divisor being 0 and return NULL instead. If necessary set \"ansi_mode\" to \"false\" (except for ANSI interval type) to bypass this error.\r\n```\r\nThe \"(except for ANSI interval type)\" part is confusing.  We should remove it for the numeric arithmetic operations and have a new error class for the interval division error: \"INTERVAL_DIVIDED_BY_ZERO\"\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor better error messages\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, Use different error classes for numeric/interval divided by 0. After changes, the error messages are simpler and more clear.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT","created_at":"2022-07-27T05:58:30Z","updated_at":"2022-08-01T17:50:48Z","closed_at":"2022-07-28T04:23:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a60b6a4df7b00e5a5525fe8f86260bb5d4b5d4b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37313/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37313/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37313/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/aca818d39d48dd0428c21a870021452a18e0c1a4","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:fixDivideByZero","ref":"fixDivideByZero","sha":"aca818d39d48dd0428c21a870021452a18e0c1a4","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn Spark 3.3, the error message of ANSI CAST is improved. However, the table insertion is using the same CAST expression:\r\n```\r\n> create table tiny(i tinyint);\r\n> insert into tiny values (1000);\r\n\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException[CAST_OVERFLOW]: The value 1000 of the type \"INT\" cannot be cast to \"TINYINT\" due to an overflow. Use `try_cast` to tolerate overflow and return NULL instead. If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error.\r\n```\r\n\r\nShowing the hint of `If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error` doesn't help at all. This PR is to fix the error message. After changes, the error message of this example will become:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException: [CAST_OVERFLOW_IN_TABLE_INSERT] Fail to insert a value of \"INT\" type into the \"TINYINT\" type column `i` due to an overflow. Use `try_cast` on the input value to tolerate overflow and return NULL instead.\r\n```\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nShow proper error messages on the overflow errors of table insert. The current message is super confusing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, after changes it show proper error messages on the overflow errors of table insert.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix `KubernetesExecutorBackend` to handle IPv6 hostname.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`entrypoint.sh` uses `SPARK_EXECUTOR_POD_IP` for `--hostname`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e9eb28e27d10497c8b36774609823f4bbd2c8500/resource-managers/kubernetes/docker/src/main/dockerfiles/spark/entrypoint.sh#L97\r\n\r\nHowever, IPv6 `status.podIP` has no `[]`. We need to handle both IPv6 cases (`[]` or no `[]`).\r\n```yaml\r\n    - name: SPARK_EXECUTOR_POD_IP\r\n          fieldPath: status.podIP\r\n      value: -Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses=true\r\n  podIP: 2600:1f14:552:fb00:4c14::3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, previously, it fails immediately.\r\n```\r\n22/07/26 19:20:46 INFO Executor: Starting executor ID 5 on host 2600:1f14:552:fb02:2dc2::1\r\n22/07/26 19:20:46 ERROR CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend: Executor self-exiting due to : Unable to create executor due to assertion failed: Expected hostname or IPv6 IP enclosed in [] but got 2600:1f14:552:fb02:2dc2::1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe previously committed check for running black did not actually work and caused code to be committed that does not follow the linter rules. This patch fixes the way we check if black is locally installed and update the `dev/reformat-python` script. In addition, we run the script to fix existing style issues. Similar to the original PR #32779 this patch only applies the black checks on the pandas code.\r\n\r\nThe black version is updated in this PR because on an empty virtualenv the selected version of click ends up in a conflict due to a underspecified version of click. See https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2964.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe have linter rules, we should actually address them.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual testing.\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-26T20:11:31Z","updated_at":"2022-08-01T07:57:13Z","closed_at":"2022-08-01T07:57:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a5dad9afddc84cbdc5e267e83c123dec0419a1e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis adds `unpivot` and its alias `melt` to the PySpark API. It calls into Scala `Dataset.unpivot` (#36150). Small difference to Scala method signature is that PySpark method has default values. This is similar to `melt` in Spark Pandas API.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo support `unpivot` in Python.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, adds `DataFrame.unpivot` and `DataFrame.melt` to PySpark API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test to `test_dataframe.py`.","created_at":"2022-07-26T19:58:21Z","updated_at":"2022-08-01T07:40:15Z","closed_at":"2022-08-01T01:39:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"692835098dfd166dd8c6099fa7b6bf8834775c68","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37304/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37304/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37304/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/db2c5f1574acc6e0b8f52c3293755c7725d889b8","head":{"label":"G-Research:branch-pyspark-unpivot","ref":"branch-pyspark-unpivot","sha":"db2c5f1574acc6e0b8f52c3293755c7725d889b8","user":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":214350064,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQzNTAwNjQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"G-Research/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes a mismatch between v1 and v2 SHOW FUNCTIONS command: v1 prints qualified function names such as `spark_catalog.db1.f1`, but v2 only prints the function name. V2 command should follow v1 behavior which makes more sense.\r\n\r\nThis PR also updates the SHOW FUNCTIONS test suites to match the new behavior.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nkeep v1 and v2 commands consistent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, v2 SHOW FUNCTIONS is new in Spark 3.4 (not released)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nupdated

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr use `BytePackerForLong#unpack8Values` with `Array` input api  instead of `BytePackerForLong#unpack8Values` with `ByteBuffer` input api in

needed?\r\n`BytePackerForLong#unpack8Values` with `ByteBuffer` input api has hotspot in using `HeapByteBuffer#get(int)` due to `HeapByteBuffer#get(int)` needs boundary check every time it is called,

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a rework for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34468, since we pull out v1write required ordering.\r\n\r\nThis prs add a new parameter numStaticPartitions to v1write and FileFormatWriter so we can skip unnecessary local sort for static partition write.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe v1 write requires ordering for dynamic partition, bucket expression and sort column during writing. The reason is the `DynamicPartitionDataSingleWriter` and `DynamicPartitionDataConcurrentWriter` assume the partition and bucket columns are continuous. Then if partition column is static, it's unnecessary to do the local sort.\r\n\r\nFor  v1 write, `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand` is the only case which adds a local sort even if the partition column is static.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno, only improve performance\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadd

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a new flag to 'run-tests.py' that supports retaining\r\nthe output of the run test. Previously all log files and data will\r\nbe deleted as soon as the test successfully finishes. This makes it\r\nharder to write and debug test cases when incrementally developing.\r\n\r\nThe new flag uses the already exising 'target' flag to redirect the\r\ntest output to this location and simply bypass the deletion in the\r\nend.\r\n\r\nThe semantics of the test output are not changed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nAdds a new flag to the 'run-tests.py' script. The flag is by default unused.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested with and without the flag for successful and failing\r\ntests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-26T08:31:21Z","updated_at":"2022-07-27T00:33:52Z","closed_at":"2022-07-27T00:31:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fad38b2bc8f0b02a60100f7905161feeb040cd23","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37288/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37288/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37288/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/06e1928711e90f65d808c1fbf4c285ff427dd189","head":{"label":"grundprinzip:pyspark_runtests","ref":"pyspark_runtests","sha":"06e1928711e90f65d808c1fbf4c285ff427dd189","user":{"login":"grundprinzip","id":3421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip","html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":503900825,"node_id":"R_kgDOHgjqmQ","name":"spark","full_name":"grundprinzip/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"grundprinzip","id":3421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip","html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`CatalogImpl` has been updated quite a bit recently, to support v2 catalogs. This PR revisits the recent changes and refines the code a little bit:\r\n1. fix the naming \"3 layer namespace\". The spark catalog plugin supports n-part namespace. This PR changes it to `qualified name with catalog`.\r\n2. always use the v2 code path. Today the v2 code path can already cover all the functionalities of `CatalogImpl` and it's unnecessary to keep the v1 code path in `CatalogImpl`. It also makes sure the behavior is consistent between `db.table` and `spark_catalog.db.table`. Previously it was not consistent in some cases, see the updated tests for functions.\r\n3. simplify `try {v1 code path} catch {... v2 code path}` to `val name = if (table exists in HMS) {name qualified with spark_catalog} else {parsed name}; v2 code path`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  4. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\ncode cleanup.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nMake GlobalLimit inherit UnaryNode rather than OrderPreservingUnaryNode\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nGlobal limit can not promise the output ordering is same with child, it actually depend on the certain physical plan.\r\n\r\nFor all physical plan with gobal limits:\r\n- CollectLimitExec: it does not promise output ordering\r\n- GlobalLimitExec: it required all tuples so it can assume the child is shuffle or child is single partition. Then it can use output ordering of child\r\n- TakeOrderedAndProjectExec: it do sort inside it's implementation\r\n\r\nThis bug get worse since we pull out v1 write require ordering.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, bug fix\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn Spark 3.3, the error message of ANSI CAST is improved. However, the table insertion is using the same CAST expression:\r\n```\r\n> create table tiny(i tinyint);\r\n> insert into tiny values (1000);\r\n\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException[CAST_OVERFLOW]: The value 1000 of the type \"INT\" cannot be cast to \"TINYINT\" due to an overflow. Use `try_cast` to tolerate overflow and return NULL instead. If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error.\r\n```\r\n\r\nShowing the hint of `If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error` doesn't help at all. This PR is to fix the error message. After changes, the error message of this example will become:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException: [CAST_OVERFLOW_IN_TABLE_INSERT] Fail to insert a value of \"INT\" type into the \"TINYINT\" type column `i` due to an overflow. Use `try_cast` on the input value to tolerate overflow and return NULL instead.\r\n```\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nShow proper error messages on the overflow errors of table insert. The current message is super confusing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, after changes it show proper error messages on the overflow errors of table insert.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies `ExecutionListenerManager` so that its `ExecutionListenerBus` SparkListener is lazily registered during the first `.register(QueryExceutionListener)` (instead of eagerly registering it in the constructor).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis addresses a ListenerBus performance problem in applications with large numbers of short-lived SparkSessions.\r\n\r\nThe `ExecutionListenerBus` SparkListener is unregistered by the ContextCleaner after its associated ExecutionListenerManager/SparkSession is garbage-collected (see #31839). If many sessions are rapidly created and destroyed but the driver GC doesn't run then this can result in large number of unused ExecutionListenerBus listeners being registered on the shared ListenerBus queue. This can cause performance problems in the ListenerBus because each listener invocation has some overhead.\r\n\r\nIn one real-world application with a very large driver heap and high rate of SparkSession creation (hundreds per minute), I saw 5000 idle ExecutionListenerBus listeners, resulting in ~50ms median event processing times on the shared listener queue.\r\n\r\nThis patch avoids this problem by making the listener registration lazy: if a short-lived SparkSession never uses QueryExecutionListeners then we won't register the ExecutionListenerBus and won't incur these overheads.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new unit

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n Correct the `EliminateSorts` follows:\r\n\r\n- If the upper sort is global then we can remove the global or local sort recursively.\r\n- If the upper sort is local then we can only remove the local sort recursively.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIf a global sort below locol sort, we should not remove the global sort becuase the output partitioning can be affected.\r\n\r\nThis issue is going to worse since we pull out the V1 Write sort to logcial side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, bug fix\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n Correct the `EliminateSorts` follows:\r\n\r\n- If the upper sort is global then we can remove the global or local sort recursively.\r\n- If the upper sort is local then we can only remove the local sort recursively.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIf a global sort below locol sort, we should not remove the global sort becuase the output partitioning can be affected.\r\n\r\nThis issue is going to worse since we pull out the V1 Write sort to logcial side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, bug fix\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to avoid out-of-memory in TPC-DS build at GitHub Actions CI by:\r\n\r\n- Increasing the number of partitions being used in shuffle.\r\n- Truncating precisions after 10th in floats.\r\n    The number of partitions was previously set to 1 because of different results in precisions that generally we can just ignore.\r\n- Sort the results regardless of join type since Apache Spark does not guarantee the order of results\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons for the large memory usage seems to be single partition that's being used in the shuffle.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions in this CI will test it out.","created_at":"2022-07-25T02:40:58Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:49:58Z","closed_at":"2022-07-25T03:44:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5b87594c56d407415e71a38d7bd36f9d214423e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37270/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37270/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37270/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7cf25b587bba4a296b721b17070ec6d058bb0df3","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:deflake-tpcds","ref":"deflake-tpcds","sha":"7cf25b587bba4a296b721b17070ec6d058bb0df3","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of the `withNewChildInternal(newChild: LogicalPlan)` method in case class `Generate` simply replace with current child with the `newChild`, without updating the field `unrequiredChildIndex`. This means the  `unrequiredChildIndex` for the 'old' child will be applied to `newChild` as well, which can lead to error if the `newChild` has a different node set or it's just a re-ordering of the old child.\r\nThe proposed fix tries to use the `exprId` instead: it first collects the set of `exprId` from the curent child, it then finds all the indices in the `newChild` whose `exprId`s are found in the current set. After that a new `Geneate` node will be created with the `newChild` and the updated indices.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSee the answer to the last question.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nA unit test is added to `SparkPlanSuite` (though I'm not quite sure where is the best place to put the test 😓)","created_at":"2022-07-24T19:47:22Z","updated_at":"2022-07-26T09:19:09Z","closed_at":"2022-07-26T09:19:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"90f8016b6004bcbf764614a5070233b3d1e0e014","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37269/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37269/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37269/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/391c0c45696da8dff113e9566be3e479057b8bff","head":{"label":"OptiCloud-AB:fix-SPARK-39854","ref":"fix-SPARK-39854","sha":"391c0c45696da8dff113e9566be3e479057b8bff","user":{"login":"OptiCloud-AB","id":109909371,"node_id":"O_kgDOBo0Vew","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109909371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptiCloud-AB","html_url":"https://github.com/OptiCloud-AB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptiCloud-AB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptiCloud-AB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptiCloud-AB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptiCloud-AB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptiCloud-AB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptiCloud-AB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptiCloud-AB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptiCloud-AB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptiCloud-AB/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":517342432,"node_id":"R_kgDOHtYE4A","name":"spark","full_name":"OptiCloud-AB/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"OptiCloud-AB","id":109909371,"node_id":"O_kgDOBo0Vew","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109909371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptiCloud-AB","html_url":"https://github.com/OptiCloud-AB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptiCloud-AB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptiCloud-AB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptiCloud-AB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptiCloud-AB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptiCloud-AB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptiCloud-AB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptiCloud-AB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptiCloud-AB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OptiCloud-AB/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/OptiCloud-AB/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently stage level scheduling works for yarn/k8s/standalone cluster when dynamic allocation is enabled, and spark app will acquire executors with different resource profiles and assign tasks to executors with the same resource profile id.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposed to add stage level scheduling when dynamic allocation is off. In this case, spark app will only have executors with default resource profiles, but different `Stages` can still customize their task resource requests which should be compatible with default resource profile executor resources. And all these `Stages` with different task resource requests will reuse/share the same set of executors with default resource profile.\r\n\r\nAnd this PR proposed to:\r\n1. Introduces a new special `ResourceProfile`: `TaskResourceProfile`, it can be used to describe different task resource requests when dynamic allocation is off. And tasks bind to this `TaskResourceProfile` will reuse executors with default resource profile.\r\n`Exception` should be thrown if executors with default resource profile can not fulfill the task resource requests. \r\n```\r\nclass TaskResourceProfile(override val taskResources: Map[String, TaskResourceRequest])\r\n  extends ResourceProfile(\r\n    ResourceProfile.getOrCreateDefaultProfile(SparkEnv.get.conf).executorResources,\r\n    taskResources)\r\n```\r\n2. `DADScheduler` and `TaskScheduler` will schedule tasks with customized `ResourceProfile` based on resource profile type and resource profile Id, taskSets with `TaskResourceProfile` can be scheduled to executors with `DEFAULT_RESOURCE_PROFILE_ID` and other taskSets can be scheduled to executors with exactly same resource profile id.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen dynamic allocation is disabled, we can also leverage stage level schedule to customize task resource requests for different stages.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nSpark users can specify `TaskResourceProfile` to customize task resource requests for different stages when dynamic allocation is off.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UTs added.","created_at":"2022-07-24T15:32:42Z","updated_at":"2022-09-30T01:44:49Z","closed_at":"2022-09-30T01:04:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"37d88116cc2fdbbf073664bbc2c802fe268292a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37268/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37268/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37268/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/21d01ce8367cec2c6accc95080420b50c21211bd","head":{"label":"ivoson:stage-schedule-dynamic-off","ref":"stage-schedule-dynamic-off","sha":"21d01ce8367cec2c6accc95080420b50c21211bd","user":{"login":"ivoson","id":15122230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTIyMjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15122230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivoson","html_url":"https://github.com/ivoson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivoson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivoson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivoson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivoson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivoson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivoson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivoson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivoson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivoson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":116949039,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTY5NDkwMzk=","name":"spark","full_name":"ivoson/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ivoson","id":15122230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTIyMjMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15122230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivoson","html_url":"https://github.com/ivoson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivoson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivoson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivoson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivoson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivoson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivoson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivoson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivoson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivoson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ivoson/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR improves join stats estimation if one side can keep uniqueness(The distinct keys of the children of the join are a subset of the join keys). A common case is:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT i_item_sk ss_item_sk\r\nFROM   item,\r\n       (SELECT DISTINCT iss.i_brand_id    brand_id,\r\n                        iss.i_class_id    class_id,\r\n                        iss.i_category_id category_id\r\n        FROM   item iss) x\r\nWHERE  i_brand_id = brand_id\r\n       AND i_class_id = class_id\r\n       AND i_category_id = category_id \r\n```\r\n\r\nIn

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Move `DESCRIBE TABLE` parsing tests for columns to `DescribeRelationParserSuite`.\r\n2. Move the column tests for `DESCRIBE TABLE` from `describe-table-column.sql` to v1 `DescribeTableSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. The unification will allow to run common `DESCRIBE TABLE` columns tests for both DSv1/Hive DSv1 and DSv2\r\n2. We can detect missing features and differences between DSv1 and DSv2 implementations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"testOnly *DDLParserSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z describe-table-column.sql\"\r\n```\r\nand new test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly *DescribeTableParserSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a follow-up PR to [[SPARK-38102](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38102)]\r\n\r\nIt is needed to support custom commitProtocolClass class when using saveAsNewAPIHadoopDataset by an option. For example,\r\n\r\nspark.hadoop.mapreduce.sources.commitProtocolClass org.apache.spark.internal.io.cloud.PathOutputCommitProtocol\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere is no way to apply spark-hadoop-cloud's commitProtocolClass when using saveAsNewAPIHadoopDataset that are to avoid object storage's problem.\r\n\r\nhttps://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/cloud-integration.html\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. The option is added that is spark.hadoop.mapreduce.sources.commitProtocolClass\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Adding unittest\r\n2.

interrupted.\r\n\r\nOne of our jobs experienced a failure in `RocksDBLoader`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalThreadStateException\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.start(Thread.java:708)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.state.RocksDBLoader$.loadLibrary(RocksDBLoader.scala:51) \r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter investigation, we determined that this was due to task cancellation/interruption: if the task which starts the RocksDB library loading is interrupted, another thread may begin a load and crash with the thread state exception:\r\n\r\n- Although the `loadLibraryThread` child thread is is uninterruptible, the task thread which calls loadLibrary is still interruptible. \r\n- Let's say we have two tasks, A and B, both of which will call `RocksDBLoader.loadLibrary()`\r\n- Say that Task A wins the race to perform the load and enters the `synchronized` block in `loadLibrary()`, starts the `loadLibraryThread`, then blocks in the `loadLibraryThread.join()` call.\r\n- If Task A is interrupted, an `InterruptedException` will be thrown and it will exit the loadLibrary synchronized block.\r\n- At this point, Task B enters the synchronized block of its `loadLibrary() call and sees that `exception == null` because the `loadLibraryThread` started by the other task is still running, so Task B calls `loadLibraryThread.start()` and hits the thread state error because it tries to start an already-started thread.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue by adding code to check `loadLibraryThread`'s state before calling `start()`: if the thread has already been started then we will skip the `start()` call and proceed directly to the `join()`. I also modified the logging so that we can detect when this case occurs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFix a bug that can lead to task or job failures.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI reproduced the original race condition by adding a `Thread.sleep(10000)` to `loadLibraryThread.run()` (so it wouldn't complete instantly), then ran\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  test(\"multi-threaded RocksDBLoader calls with interruption\") {\r\n\r\n    val taskThread = new Thread(\"interruptible Task Thread 1\") {\r\n      override def run(): Unit = {\r\n        RocksDBLoader.loadLibrary()\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    taskThread.start()\r\n    // Give the thread time to enter the `loadLibrary()` call:\r\n    Thread.sleep(1000)\r\n    taskThread.interrupt()\r\n    // Check that the load hasn't finished:\r\n    assert(RocksDBLoader.exception == null)\r\n    assert(RocksDBLoader.loadLibraryThread.getState != Thread.State.NEW)\r\n    // Simulate the second task thread starting the load:\r\n    RocksDBLoader.loadLibrary()\r\n    // The load should finish successfully:\r\n    RocksDBLoader.exception.isEmpty\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis test failed prior to my changes and succeeds afterwards.\r\n\r\nI don't want to actually commit this test because I'm concerned about flakiness and false-negatives: in order to ensure that the test would have failed before my change, we need to carefully control the thread interleaving. This code rarely changes and is relatively simple, so I think the ROI on spending time to write and commit a reliable test is low.","created_at":"2022-07-23T18:00:58Z","updated_at":"2022-07-24T07:21:28Z","closed_at":"2022-07-23T22:46:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d69ea4910f45a781c4ef4052e5c9bb15eccf95f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nI propose this PR to warn the user when he is not using correctly the spark submit CLI.\r\nThe idea here is to add a control on duplicates arguments that should not be duplicated.\r\n\r\nAs I don't know the project so much, I've just added this rule on the following arguments : \r\n- `--py-files`\r\n- `--files`\r\n\r\nI can add more arguments to the list of non duplicatable arguments if needed.\r\n\r\nFor example using `--files` argument, the argument can only appear once with a list of files coma separated as value as follow :\r\n```shell\r\nspark-submit --files my-file,my-second-file\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if someone try to use it like below instead :\r\n```shell\r\nsparksubmit --files my-file --files my-second-file\r\n```\r\nUsing multiple times the argument `--files`, will work without error but only one of the files will be provided to spark.\r\nIt could be time consuming for user to understand why it works but not as expected.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis change is put in place to facilitate the use of spark as it's already a heavy project.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, user using duplicates arguments will now receive an error instead of submitting to spark\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to enable `spark.dynamicAllocation.shuffleTracking.enabled` by default in Apache Spark 3.4 when `spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=true` and `spark.shuffle.service.enabled=false`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nHere is a brief history around `spark.dynamicAllocation.shuffleTracking.enabled`.\r\n- Apache Spark 3.0.0 added it via SPARK-27963 for K8s environment.\r\n  > One immediate use case is the ability to use dynamic allocation on Kubernetes, which doesn't yet have that service.\r\n- Apache Spark 3.1.1 made K8s GA via SPARK-33005 and started to used it in K8s widely.\r\n- Apache Spark 3.2.0 started to support shuffle data recovery on the reused PVCs via SPARK-35593\r\n- Apache Spark 3.3.0 removed `Experimental` tag from it via SPARK-39322.\r\n- Apache Spark 3.4.0 will enable it by default via SPARK-39846 (this PR) to help Spark K8s users to dynamic allocation more easily.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe `Core` migration guide is updated.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs including K8s IT GitHub Action

ADD COLUMNS` commands assign column DEFAULT values, Spark constant-folds these values and stores the result in the `EXISTS_DEFAULT` column metadata. This allows the target data source to substitute this value for rows where the corresponding field is not present in storage. This responsibility is up to each data source.\r\n\r\nIn order to grant flexibility to certain data sources that are not yet ready to support this functionality, in this PR we update the `SQLConf.DEFAULT_COLUMN_ALLOWED_PROVIDERS` to support an optional asterisk after each table provider. When the asterisk is present, `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` commands may not include DEFAULT values; when absent, they may include them.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting column DEFAULT test coverage + new unit test

request?\r\nCurrently, We do not handle conflicting binary comparison expressions, Let's say have a query, it filter `a < 0 and a > 1`, this condition should be a `FalseLiteral`, we can fold ahead of time to avoid unnecessary calculations.\r\n\r\nHave a idea, we can capture a and conjunction and both it's left and right are `BinaryComparisonExpression`, we optimize this predicate as following step:\r\n\r\n- Normal and left and right comparison expression, to keep Attribute is left side and literal is right side.\r\n- If both comparison expression left child is semantic equal and right child is foldable, we compute a range for column predicate comparison .\r\n- Then update this column comparison predicate by this range.\r\n\r\nBefore this pr:\r\n<img width=\"1439\" alt=\"image\"

If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdate the `UnsafeRow` structural integrity check in `UnsafeRowUtils.validateStructuralIntegrity` to handle a special case with null variable-length DecimalType value.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe check should follow the format that `UnsafeRowWriter` produces. In general, `UnsafeRowWriter` clears out a field with zero when the field is set to be null, c.f. `UnsafeRowWriter.setNullAt(ordinal)` and `UnsafeRow.setNullAt(ordinal)`.\r\n\r\nBut there's a special case for `DecimalType` values: this is the only type that is both:\r\n- can be fixed-length or variable-length, depending on the precision, and\r\n- is mutable in `UnsafeRow`.\r\n\r\nTo support a variable-length `DecimalType` to be mutable in `UnsafeRow`, the `UnsafeRowWriter` always leaves a 16-byte space in the variable-length section of the `UnsafeRow` (tail end of the row), regardless of whether the `Decimal` value being written is null or not. In the fixed-length part of the field, it would be an \"OffsetAndSize\", and the `offset` part always points to the start offset of the variable-length part of the field, while the `size` part will either be `0` for the null value, or `1` to at most `16` for non-null values.\r\nWhen `setNullAt(ordinal)` is called instead of passing a null value to `write(int, Decimal, int, int)`, however, the `offset` part gets zero'd out and this field stops being mutable. There's a comment on `UnsafeRow.setDecimal` that mentions to keep this field able to support updates, `setNullAt(ordinal)` cannot be called, but there's no code enforcement of that.\r\n\r\nSo we need to recognize that in the structural integrity check and allow variable-length `DecimalType` to have non-zero field even for null.\r\n\r\nNote that for non-null values, the existing check does conform to the format from `UnsafeRowWriter`. It's only null value of variable-length `DecimalType` that'd trigger a bug, which can affect Structured Streaming's checkpoint file read where this check is applied.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, previously the `UnsafeRow` structural integrity validation will return false positive for correct data, when there's a null value in a variable-length `DecimalType` field. The fix will no longer return false positive.\r\nBecause the Structured Streaming checkpoint file validation uses this check, previously a good checkpoint file may be rejected by the check, and the only workaround is to disable the check; with the fix, the correct checkpoint file will be allowed to load.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes the issue SPARK-39838 where an explicitly set empty Column Metadata object would be optimized away, making it impossible to reset column metadata.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe behaviour changed from Spark 3.2.x to Spark 3.3. While  Spark 3.2.x would respect explicitly resetting a columns metadata to empty, Spark 3.3 inherits the metadata from child nodes. From my point of view, Spark 3.2.x behaviour is correct while Spark 3.3 is unexpected.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNot really, except that it restores the behaviour of Spark 3.2.x\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nA unittest was

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n Correct the `EliminateSorts` follows:\r\n\r\n- If the upper sort is global then we can remove the global or local sort recursively.\r\n- If the upper sort is local then we can only remove the local sort recursively.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIf a global sort below locol sort, we should not remove the global sort becuase the output partitioning can be affected.\r\n\r\nThis issue is going to worse since we pull out the V1 Write sort to logcial side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, bug fix\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord
