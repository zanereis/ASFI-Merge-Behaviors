If you do a non-tx put directly on a member of a geode cluster (for\r\n  example using a geode function), then the value is stored in the PR\r\n  locally in a CachedDeserializable. But if you do the same op in a\r\n  transaction it will store the object directly in the PR with no\r\n  CachedDeserializable.\r\n- The reason for this is probably that the original tx implementation\r\n  did not support partitioned regions and on a non-pr region the local\r\n  region stored the value directly. So when support was added for\r\n  transactions on partitioned regions this part of the code was not\r\n  customized for partitions and just used the old code.\r\n- This can cause extra work to be done when fetching a value from the PR\r\n  to send it back to a client. It can also cause bucket size exceptions\r\n  if you directly change the value stored.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken: \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
