https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/17285 the PR bot exhibited 2 pieces of broken behavior:\r\n\r\n1) It requested a second review from me after having already requested one from `@riteshghorse`\r\n2) Once I approved, it requested an extra review from me again.\r\n\r\nThese were caused by 2 underlying issues:\r\n1) Git failed to correctly checkout the pr-bot-state branch causing the first issue. This led the bot to believe nobody had been assigned, and it tried to assign me, but it wasn't able to persist that state back to the state branch (See this [broken run](https://github.com/apache/beam/runs/5852769678?check_suite_focus=true)). To fix this, I added an extra git push step to make sure we're actually able to push to the pr-bot-state branch before we try to do any state manipulation.\r\n2) Because the state got out of sync, the bot didn't realize I had been assigned and thought Ritesh was still assigned. When I approved, it revealed a bug that will cause a new reviewer to get assigned when a non-reviewer approves. To fix this, I added an early return in those cases.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

module does not parse [PEP-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) compliant pyarrow version. For example, if the `pyarrow` version was `1.0.0+abc.7`, it would fail with the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/runpy.py\", line 183, in _run_module_as_main\r\n    mod_name, mod_spec, code = _get_module_details(mod_name, _Error)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/runpy.py\", line 109, in _get_module_details\r\n    __import__(pkg_name)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/apache_beam/__init__.py\", line 93, in <module>\r\n    from apache_beam import io\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/apache_beam/io/__init__.py\", line 28, in <module>\r\n    from apache_beam.io.parquetio import *\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/apache_beam/io/parquetio.py\", line 53, in <module>\r\n    ARROW_MAJOR_VERSION, _, _ = map(int, pa.__version__.split('.'))\r\nValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '0+abc.7'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn practice, this would fail when somebody uses their own fork of `pyarrow` (like me). This change uses setuptools' `pkg_resources.parse_version`, which is PEP-440 compliant after setuptools > 6.0.\r\n\r\nhttps://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#summary-of-differences-from-pkg-resources-parse-version\r\n\r\n> Note: this comparison is to pkg_resources.parse_version as it existed at the time the PEP was written. After the PEP was accepted, setuptools 6.0 and later versions adopted the behaviour described in this PEP.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

of Changes**\r\n\r\nThis pr is the first step towards full watermark estimation support - it introduces the mechanism used for watermark estimation including:\r\n\r\n- Validation (graph/fn.go)\r\n- Code generation (genx/genx.go)\r\n- Execution (exec/sdf.go and exec/sdf_invokers.go)\r\n- Propogating result back to the runner (exec/datasource.go, harness.go)\r\n- A concrete implementation of a wall clock observing estimator (sdf/watermarkEstimator.go)\r\n\r\nThis is built according to the design specified here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DqCYJ-J1YGNelCRIcN5v6BQsZxJB2l5uWBmN4ti--Ew/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n**Next Steps**\r\n\r\nThis work does not attempt any of the following (though it is built in such a way that those should be cleanly supported in subsequent PRs):\r\n\r\n- Watermark state\r\n- Manual estimators (passed into ProcessElement)\r\n- Timestamp observing estimators (call ObserveTimestamp on each emitted timestamp)\r\n\r\n**Manual Testing**\r\n\r\nOn top of all the unit tests introduced, I hacked the existing textio sdf doFn and added the following function:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc (fn *readSdfFn) CreateWatermarkEstimator() sdf.WallTimeWatermarkEstimator {\r\n\treturn sdf.WallTimeWatermarkEstimator{}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand ran wordCount (with the textio sdf version) on dataflow so that I could observe the output watermark was getting correctly updated to the current wall clock time:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"464\" alt=\"image\"

adds our failing flink post commit test to the exclusion list and undoes an attempted fix from #17227 - at the moment I'm going to write up my findings thus far and stop looking into it since it is lower priority than some other work.\r\n\r\nThe fix from #17227 didn't work because it attempts to add args to the flink shadowJar build step, but that remains cached even when you add args apparently (which sorta makes sense to me, that way we don't have to rebuild it every time). The underlying issue is the same as the precommit issue fixed by https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/17067 but we spin up flink differently in our post commits and so our config change doesn't affect flink in those instances.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the input watermark as the output timestamp for processing time timers causes many issues, rooted in the fact that the input watermark can advance past the end of the window that the timer is set in.\r\n\r\nThis causes:\r\n- Errors outputting valid elements, since the user's supplied output timestamp is now validated to be after the (incorrect) timestamp of the timer (https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15540)\r\n- Incorrect timestamps on elements output by `OnTimerContext.output`, elements may be emitted with a timestamp after the end of their window.  One of the most noticeable cases here is that elements are emitted with `BoundedWindow.MAX_TIMESTAMP` in some cases when dataflow jobs are drained.\r\n\r\nFor more context: https://lists.apache.org/thread/gmqr5d4jm3sb308rmm8t6wc45pm97h26\r\n\r\nR: @reuvenlax @lukecwik \r\n\r\nPS: I'm not sure if there's an existing JIRA capturing this, if not I'll make a new one.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

can't assume that any expansion service resolves any artifact information. For example, Java artifacts returned from Java expansion service cannot be resolved (+downloaded) with Python expansion service. Also, one Python expansion service may returns Python artifacts which are unknown to other Python expansion service. We need to skip pre-existing artifacts and only resolves artifacts in new environments from the expansion service at the moment.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

now, Go flink Post commits are failing with `java.io.IOException: Insufficient number of network buffers: required 17, but only 16 available. The total number of network buffers is currently set to 2048 of 32768 bytes each. You can increase this number by setting the configuration keys 'taskmanager.memory.network.fraction', 'taskmanager.memory.network.min', and 'taskmanager.memory.network.max'.`\r\n\r\nThis is the same underlying issue I fixed in #17067 but it shows up again here because we have a different mechanism for spinning up flink for these post commit tests. This PR does 2 things:\r\n\r\n1) It moves the memory buffer config used by the Go tests into our shared flink test config. This is verified working in the precommit checks.\r\n2) It sets PflinkConfDir to point to this config directory in our post commit infra. This corresponds to a property in our flink gradle job server file where we start up flink - https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/5a622286db56535592e99b380308443bfeebf6c2/runners/flink/job-server/flink_job_server.gradle#L116\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** The post commit changes (changing PflinkConfDir) aren't able to be tested because I can't actually repro the problem locally, and Jenkin's infra seems to run post commits against master (even when triggered against PRs). So this may not work, but the blast radius (potential to briefly break post-commits) is relatively small, and I'll quickly revert it if this makes things any worse. I do feel pretty confident it won't make things worse though since I was able to at least run the tests locally with `-PflinkConfDir=$pwd/runners/flink/src/test/resources`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

to add dependencies to the expansion service, we have to modify the build.gradle file and build it again. To simplify this, users can pass the maven-gradle style jar name and it is fetched and new jar is composed when starting an automated expansion service in Go SDK. Tested it with mysql and postgresql in JDBC IO and the expansion service is able to find the corresponding Driver. However, due to other error connecting to mysql (which existed before this the other way as well) I added the test for just postgresql. \r\n\r\nOverall this mechanism won't be in the test suite unless we use automated expansion service for our XLang IOs.\r\nAttached is image showing `tmp.jar`, the composed jar including the specified dependencies.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25881114/160726247-f012cd78-f67c-43a3-aae9-b89ea5ec2b4a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
