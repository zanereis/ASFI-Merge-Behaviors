What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to make `core` module tests succeed in Java 21.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change API of parameterized SQL, and replace type of argument values from `string` to `Any` in `sql_formatter`. Language API can accept `Any` objects from which it is possible to construct literal expressions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo align the API to PySpark's `sql()`.\r\n\r\nAnd the current implementation the parameterized `sql()` requires arguments as string values parsed to SQL literal expressions that causes the following issues:\r\n1. SQL comments are skipped while parsing, so, some fragments of input might be skipped. For example, `'Europe -- Amsterdam'`. In this case, `-- Amsterdam` is excluded from the input.\r\n2. Special chars in string values must be escaped, for instance `'E\\'Twaun Moore'`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ python/run-tests --parallelism=1 --testnames 'pyspark.pandas.sql_formatter'\r\n```","created_at":"2023-06-17T18:22:56Z","updated_at":"2023-06-19T00:32:25Z","closed_at":"2023-06-19T00:32:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8bb3715270578f0cf8fd7bfb9a9e6c2b763f841b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMove `DataFrameFunctionsSuite` to `sql - slow`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1, recently `DataFrameFunctionsSuite` is frequently updated for the new functions, while `sql - other` is quite flaky and it's likely to get stuck or failed before `DataFrameFunctionsSuite` is actually tested (see https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/61a195d33936d6059933de017fa251dac961021e and https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/37f9beaba7e8bdf9f417453d7dab0b7773b55200), so it is hard for the reviewers to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRename `k_res` to `ps_res` and `ps` to `pser` in `test_combine.py`. There is no functional change; it's purely stylistic/for consistency.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAs a reader, the variable names are confusing and inconsistent. I only thought that the `k_` prefix meant Koalas because I've contributed to Koalas in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests should continue to pass; no new tests necessary\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-17T00:00:07Z","updated_at":"2023-06-20T17:55:53Z","closed_at":"2023-06-19T00:33:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b3351b6225289c802d3f08f200bfd1fff8476409","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUtility methods in `PartitionedFileUtil` take both `file: FileStatusWithMetadata` and `filePath: Path`, even tho the latter can be obtained easily from the former.\r\n\r\nThis was originally done for performance reasons, so callers can pass a memoized `Path` and thus avoid the cost of an additional `FileStatus.getPath` call.\r\n\r\nNow that we have `FileStatusWithMetadata`, the redundancy is no longer needed -- the new class can simply capture the path as a lazy val.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSimpler code (and eliminates risk of passing a mismatched path).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. Internal API change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSmall refactor, existing unit tests

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a ServletHandler to support overriding SQL configurations for new connections.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo support overriding the SQL config default value for new connections without restart SparkContext. The use cases:\r\n1. Disable a newly introduced feature if it has a bug.\r\n2. Fine-tune the value of some configurations. For example: `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionNum` ,`spark.sql.parquet.pushdown.inFilterThreshold`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual test.\r\n\r\n1.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen using partition writing with InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand, `listPartitions` will fetch all partition metadata, which causes huge pressure on metadata service. Therefore, this pull request generates the file paths first when writing with dynamic partition, and then retrieves metadata, reducing the pressure on metadata service.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. `listPartitions` fetches all metadata where using dynamic partition writing.\r\n2. When dynamically writing partitions, the number of partition written is generally much smaller than the total number of partitions in the table.\r\n3. Therefore, when writing with dynamic partitioning, the file is first written and get the `updatedPartitionPaths` from `FileFormatWriter.write`. \r\n4. Partition information is obtained through `listPartitionsByNames` by using `updatedPartitionPaths`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n1. Create table\r\n```scala\r\n-- hive sql\r\ncreate table test.table(id String, name String) partitioned by(date string) stored as orc;\r\n```\r\n2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to upgrade Scala to 2.13.11\r\n- https://www.scala-lang.org/news/2.13.11\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this pr adds a new suppression rule for warning message: `Implicit definition should have explicit type`, this is a new compile check introduced by https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10083, we must fix it when we upgrading to use Scala 3, \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis release improves collections, adds support for JDK 20 and 21, adds support for JDK 17 `sealed`:\r\n- https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10363\r\n- https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10184\r\n- https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10397\r\n- https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10348\r\n- https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10105\r\n\r\nThere are 2 known issues in this version:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/12800\r\n- https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/12799\r\n\r\nFor the first one, there is no compilation warning messages related to `match may not be exhaustive` in Spark compile log, and for the second one, there is no case of `method.isAnnotationPresent(Deprecated.class)` in Spark code, there is just \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/8c84d2c9349d7b607db949c2e114df781f23e438/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/JavaTypeInference.scala#L130\r\n\r\nin Spark Code, and I checked `@javax.annotation.Nonnull` no this issue.\r\n\r\nSo I think These two issues will not affect Spark itself, but this doesn't mean it won't affect the code written by end users themselves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe full release notes as follows:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.13.11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this is a Scala version change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Existing Test\r\n- Checked Java 8/17 + Scala 2.13.11 using GA, all test passed\r\n\r\nJava 8 + Scala 2.13.11: https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark/runs/14337279564\r\nJava 17 + Scala 2.13.11:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a `JobArtifactSet` which holds the jars/files/archives relevant to a particular Spark Job. Using this \"set\", we are able to support specifying visible/available resources for a job based on, for example, the SparkSession that the job belongs to.\r\n\r\nWith resource specification support, we are further able to extend this to support classloader/resource isolation on the executors. The executors would use the `uuid` from the `JobArtifactSet` to either create or obtain from a cache the [IsolatedSessionState](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41625/files#diff-d7a989c491f3cb77cca02c701496a9e2a3443f70af73b0d1ab0899239f3a789dR57) which holds the \"state\" (i.e classloaders, files, jars, archives etc) for that particular `uuid`.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the code will default to copying over resources from the `SparkContext` (the current/default behaviour) to avoid any behaviour changes. A follow-up PR would use this mechanism in Spark Connect to isolate resources among Spark Connect sessions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nA current limitation of Scala UDFs is that a Spark cluster would only be able to support a single REPL at a time due to the fact that classloaders of different Spark Sessions (and therefore, Spark Connect sessions) aren't isolated from each other. Without isolation, REPL-generated class files and user-added JARs may conflict if there are multiple users of the cluster.\r\n\r\nThus, we need a mechanism to support isolated sessions (i.e isolated resources/classloader) so that each REPL user does not conflict with other users on the same cluster.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests + new suite

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImplemented bitmap functions. The functions are:\r\n- `bitmap_bucket_number()`: returns the bucket number for a given input number\r\n- `bitmap_bit_position()`: returns bit position for a given input number\r\n- `bitmap_count()`: returns the number of set bits from an input bitmap\r\n- `bitmap_construct_agg()`: aggregation function that aggregates input bit positions, and creates a bitmap\r\n- `bitmap_or_agg()`: aggregation function that performs a bitwise OR on all the input bitmaps\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThese functions can be used to count distinct values for integer columns. For example:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT sum(cnt) FROM (\r\n  SELECT bitmap_bucket_number(c), bitmap_count(bitmap_construct_agg(bitmap_bit_position(c))) cnt\r\n  FROM table GROUP BY 1\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nis equivalent to:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT count(distinct c) FROM table\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. After this PR, these functions are usable in queries.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew tests were added.","created_at":"2023-06-16T07:28:05Z","updated_at":"2023-07-06T00:39:15Z","closed_at":"2023-07-06T00:39:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1cc70f69f69ebed977d85162ac9ece69f36f7860","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41623/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41623/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41623/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/822a650d1d1b2d8feaaf030802daddb247fd660b","head":{"label":"gene-db:bitmap-fns","ref":"bitmap-fns","sha":"822a650d1d1b2d8feaaf030802daddb247fd660b","user":{"login":"gene-db","id":77996944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3OTk2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77996944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db","html_url":"https://github.com/gene-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":654336314,"node_id":"R_kgDOJwBhOg","name":"spark","full_name":"gene-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gene-db","id":77996944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3OTk2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77996944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db","html_url":"https://github.com/gene-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gene-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr move `NonFateSharingCache` from `core` module to `catalyst` to make `catalyst` module can test using maven.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSPARK-43300 introduced `NonFateSharingCache` to `core` module and it only used by `CodeGenerator` which is in `catalyst` module. \r\n\r\nThere are two `apply` funcitons in `NonFateSharingCache` and the input parameter of `NonFateSharingCache#apply` is `com.google.common.cache.Cache/LoadingCache`.\r\n\r\nThe `catalyst` module may use shaded spark-core jar when we do maven testing and in the shaded spark-core jar, the Guava related classes will be relocated from `com.google.common` to `org.sparkproject.guava`, so the input parameter of `NonFateSharingCache#apply` will change to `org.sparkproject.guava.cache.Cache/LoadingCache`, but the catalyst module has not been shaded yet when do maven testing, so `CodeGenerator` will still use type `com.google.common.cache.Cache` to call the `NonFateSharingCache#apply` function, then this will result in a mismatch of input types when do maven testing and maven test will aborted as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nProductAggSuite:\r\n*** RUN ABORTED ***\r\n  java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.CodeGenerator$\r\n

this is safe now because `NonFateSharingCache` is only used by `catalyst` now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLooking at [unresolved.scala](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/unresolved.scala), catalyst would benefit from an `UnresolvedNode` trait that various `UnresolvedFoo` classes could inherit:\r\n```scala\r\ntrait UnresolvedNode extends LogicalPlan {\r\n  override def output: Seq[Attribute] = Nil\r\n  override lazy val resolved = false\r\n}\r\n```\r\nToday, the code is duplicated in ~20 locations (7 of them in that one file).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nReduces redundancy, improves readability, documents programmer intent better.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nMild refactor, existing unit tests

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add warnings for the pandas-related behavior changes in next major release. Furthermore, improved the existing warning messages to provide more specific information.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn the upcoming major release of Apache Spark, 4.0.0, there are expected to be numerous breaking changes to officially support pandas 2.0.0. To ensure that our users are well aware of these changes in advance and to minimize confusion, it is necessary to provide appropriate warning messages for each feature that will undergo behavioral changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nUsers may face the warning messages when they try to use features that will be removed in next major release.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe existing CI should be passed.\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-15T10:54:38Z","updated_at":"2023-11-20T01:35:25Z","closed_at":"2023-06-16T20:18:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3e75a1b78ad40778a4a668bcb9e9f74fbc6021e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplements upsert mode for `SaveMode.Append` of the MsSql, Postgres, Derby, H2 and oracle JDBC source.\r\n\r\nThis uses `MERGE INTO` in combination with a temporary table. A batch of rows is inserted into the temporary table (rather than the target table) and merged into the target table with one `MERGE INTO` command per batch.\r\n\r\nSee #41518 for an alternative for databases not supporting `MERGE INTO` syntax.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe JDBC writer only supports either truncating the existing table or inserting. Duplicates, i.e. rows with identical values in the primary or unique index columns, cause an exception, permitting updating existing and inserting new rows.\r\n\r\nRe-evaluating a partition due to executor loss will insert rows that have been inserted in an earlier attempt, which kills the entier Spark job.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis adds `upsert` and `upsertKeyColumns` options for `SaveMode.Append` of the JDBC source.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests in `JdbcSuite` and integration suites.","created_at":"2023-06-15T09:04:02Z","updated_at":"2025-01-16T14:20:36Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3412b826babf612f4bb7bc85754af854e1763c07","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41611/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41611/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41611/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/514622759ff3c1abdba691fcbcd53350f7a76477","head":{"label":"G-Research:jdbc-upsert-merge-temp-table","ref":"jdbc-upsert-merge-temp-table","sha":"514622759ff3c1abdba691fcbcd53350f7a76477","user":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":214350064,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQzNTAwNjQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"G-Research/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR implements and exposes the PySpark util function `assertDataFrameEqual` to test for DataFrame equality in PySpark DataFrames.\r\n\r\nSPIP: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OkyBn3JbEHkkQgSQ45Lq82esXjr9rm2Vj7Ih_4zycRc/edit#heading=h.f5f0u2riv07v\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe functions simplify the PySpark testing process for users. \r\nThe `assertDataFrameEqual` function asserts whether two PySpark DataFrames are equal. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this PR introduces the user-facing util function `assertDataFrameEqual`. Previously, there was no provided Spark function to test for PySpark DataFrame equality. The new function `assertDataFrameEqual` asserts PySpark DataFrame equality. It provides a user-friendly error message in the case of unequal DataFrames.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to `python/pyspark/sql/tests/test_utils.py` and

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for group-based data sources in `RewriteUpdateTable` and builds on top of the existing logic.\r\n\r\nThe UPDATE command for group-based is executed differently based on whether there is a subquery in the condition. If there is no subquery, there is simply a projection to update matching rows. If there is a subquery, the rule would assign a union of two scans: one to find matching rows and one to carry over unmatched records in matched groups. The union is required so that subqueries can be rewritten as joins via `RewritePredicateSubquery`. In the future, we may provide a more optimized execution if the subquery is small. That said, the current approach would scale better and should be the default.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThese changes are needed per SPIP SPARK-35801.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR comes with tests. There are more tests in `AlignUpdateAssignmentsSuite`, which was merged earlier.","created_at":"2023-06-14T17:36:29Z","updated_at":"2023-06-15T00:51:21Z","closed_at":"2023-06-15T00:14:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bac379a9e764525397d3cba03ba1e653857f5ce7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41600/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41600/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41600/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9533655aee4641d9e53957818de8c3144c354fc2","head":{"label":"aokolnychyi:spark-43975","ref":"spark-43975","sha":"9533655aee4641d9e53957818de8c3144c354fc2","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61945043,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTk0NTA0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"aokolnychyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi/spark","description":"Mirror

The current function class alone does not give enough information on its own. Adding the UDF name, if available, makes it easier to identify the exact problematic UDF.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly helpful when the exception stack trace is not emitted due to a JVM performance optimization and codegen is enabled.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `KVGDS#agg` and `reduceGroups` was not able to chain mapValues functions directly with columns. This PR add the a new unresolved func `withContext` to carry the mapValues func from the client to the server.\r\n\r\nThe `withContext` can also be used to provide the missing encoders for KVGDS created via RelationalGroupedDS#as.\r\n\r\nReverted the changes to `RelationalGroupedDataset` to use expression instead of columns.\r\nRefactored the code in `SparkConnectPlanner` to always create `TypedUdf` via `ScalaUDF`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMissing functionality for the KVGDS.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nE2E","created_at":"2023-06-14T15:16:46Z","updated_at":"2023-07-31T21:22:12Z","closed_at":"2023-07-31T21:22:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6bd9c579d2a43243592c2dc2f05ac569e7215637","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41596/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41596/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41596/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/39dc35e6b818c66788ceb364a32f636974b3367e","head":{"label":"zhenlineo:agg-map-values","ref":"agg-map-values","sha":"39dc35e6b818c66788ceb364a32f636974b3367e","user":{"login":"zhenlineo","id":4190164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTAxNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4190164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo","html_url":"https://github.com/zhenlineo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":464980742,"node_id":"R_kgDOG7cLBg","name":"spark","full_name":"zhenlineo/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhenlineo","id":4190164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTAxNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4190164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo","html_url":"https://github.com/zhenlineo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhenlineo/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix `KubernetesSuite` to use `inNamespace` API for validating driver pod cleanup.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is a trick bug because of the following two reasons.\r\n- Although all test cases passed, currently K8s integration tests are running extremely slowly. \r\n- The individual test case running time shows correctly.\r\n- The slowness happens during the transition from a test to another test.\r\n\r\nThe main root cause is that K8s test shows `namespace not specified` error after

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39572 that hides the `spark.sql.execution.arrow.useLargeVarTypes` configuration as an internal configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAs described in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41569, this feature only works for `mapInArrow`, and other cases cannot be completely supported because of Arrow side limitation, see https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/35289. Therefore, this PR hides this configuration as an internal one for now.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this configuration was not released out yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan the Scala linter.","created_at":"2023-06-14T03:41:36Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:52:10Z","closed_at":"2023-06-14T18:49:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3071987fe9b097258885bb026f8fdcd81b64759e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41584/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41584/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41584/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fd168cb66b95aa84934cfd5c739452922745031a","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-39979-followup2","ref":"SPARK-39979-followup2","sha":"fd168cb66b95aa84934cfd5c739452922745031a","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

is a continuation of #41146, to change the author of the PR. Retains the description.]\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change adds a new spark connect relation type `CachedRemoteRelation`, which can represent a DataFrame that's been cached on the server side.\r\n\r\nOn the server side, each `SessionHolder` has a cache to maintain mapping from Dataframe ID to actual dataframe. \r\n\r\nOn the client side, a new relation type and function is added. The new function can create a DataFrame reference given a key. The key is the id of a cached DataFrame, which is usually passed from server to the client. When transforming the DataFrame reference, the server finds the actual DataFrame from the cache and replace it.\r\n\r\nOne use case of this function will be streaming foreachBatch(). Server needs to call user function for every batch which takes a DataFrame as argument. With the new function, we can cache the DataFrame on the server. Pass the id back to client which can creates the DataFrame reference.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis change is needed to support streaming foreachBatch() in Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nScala unit test.\r\nManual test.\r\n(More end to end test will be added when foreachBatch() is supported.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nReplace existing error message when non-time window function is used with streaming to include aggregation function and column. The error message looks like following now:\r\n\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Window function is not supported in 'row_number()' as column 'rn_col' on streaming DataFrames/Datasets. Structured Streaming only supports time-window aggregation using the `window` unction. (window specification: '(PARTITION BY col1 ORDER BY col2 ASC NULLS FIRST ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)')\r\n\r\nNote that the message is a little bit unnatural as the existing unit test requires the exception follows the pattern that it includes \"not supported\", \"streaming\" \"DataFrames\" and \"Dataset\".\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe exiting error message is vague and a full logical plan is included. A user reports that they aren't able to identify what the problem is.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a unit test\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-13T18:51:06Z","updated_at":"2023-07-05T17:24:26Z","closed_at":"2023-07-01T05:51:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f402afabb2d9cbfcc798cf2f3f694728a8548cb9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes compute stats when `BaseAggregateExec` nodes above `QueryStageExec`.\r\n\r\nFor aggregation, when the number of shuffle output

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to improve for PlanGenerationTestSuite & ProtoToParsedPlanTestSuite, include:\r\n- When generating `GOLDEN` files, we should first delete the corresponding directories and generate new ones to avoid submitting some redundant files during the review process. eg:\r\nWhen we write a test named `make_timestamp_ltz` for the overloaded method, and during the review process, the reviewer wishes to add more tests for the method. The name of this method has changed during the next submission process, such as `make_timestamp_ltz without timezone`.At this point, if the `queries/function_make_timestamp_ltz.json`, `queries/function_make_timestamp_ltz.proto.bin` and `explain-results/function_make_timestamp_ltz.explain` files of `function_make_timestamp_ltz` are already in the commit, and there are many of these files, we generally do not notice the above problem, which leads to the incorrect submission of `queries/function_make_timestamp_ltz.json`, `queries/function_make_timestamp_ltz.proto.bin` and `explain-results/function_make_timestamp_ltz.explain` files without any impact on UT. These files are redundant.\r\n\r\n- Clear and update some redundant files submitted incorrectly\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake code clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39572 that implements to use large variable types within PySpark everywhere.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39572 implemented the core logic but it only supports large variable types in the bold cases below:\r\n\r\n- `mapInArrow`: **JVM -> Python -> JVM**\r\n- Pandas UDF/Function API: **JVM -> Python** -> JVM\r\n- createDataFrame with Arrow: Python -> JVM\r\n- toPandas with Arrow: JVM -> Python\r\n\r\nThis PR completes them all.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo consistently support the large variable types.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n`spark.sql.execution.arrow.useLargeVarTypes` is not released out yet so it doesn't affect any end users.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests with `spark.sql.execution.arrow.useLargeVarTypes` enabled.","created_at":"2023-06-13T08:34:12Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:52:11Z","closed_at":"2023-06-14T03:33:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f0abfd94fb29cb6f64b28cd0d424c4d94f1ce01f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to extend SparkSession API and override the `sql` method by:\r\n```scala\r\n  def sql(sqlText: String, args: Array[_]): DataFrame\r\n```\r\nwhich accepts an array of Java/Scala objects that can be converted to SQL literal expressions.\r\n\r\nAnd the first argument `sqlText` might have named parameters in the positions of constants like literal values. A value can be also a `Column` of literal expression, in that case it is taken as is.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```scala\r\n  spark.sql(\r\n    sqlText = \"SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE date > ? LIMIT ?\",\r\n    args = Array(LocalDate.of(2023, 6, 15), 100))\r\n```\r\nThe new `sql()` method parses the input SQL statement and replaces the positional parameters by the literal values.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To conform the SQL standard and JDBC/ODBC protocol.\r\n2. To improve user experience with Spark SQL via\r\n    - Using Spark as remote service (microservice).\r\n    - Write SQL code that will power reports, dashboards, charts and other data presentation solutions that need to account for criteria modifiable by users through an interface.\r\n    - Build a generic integration layer based on the SQL API. The goal is to expose managed data to a wide application ecosystem with a microservice architecture. It is only natural in such a setup to ask for modular and reusable SQL code, that can be executed repeatedly with different parameter values.\r\n\r\n3. To achieve feature parity with other systems that support positional parameters.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, the changes extend the existing API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AnalysisSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *PlanParserSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ParametersSuite\"\r\n```\r\nand the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *QueryExecutionErrorsSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2023-06-13T08:06:05Z","updated_at":"2023-06-22T06:41:07Z","closed_at":"2023-06-22T06:41:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d34bef9a8022c21a37e23c25405d515995438ddc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41568/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41568/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41568/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f00a29d5e264655bd35e0353c63d25e262cded8d","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:parametrized-query-pos-param","ref":"parametrized-query-pos-param","sha":"f00a29d5e264655bd35e0353c63d25e262cded8d","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41316 that sets the correct batch size as 1 when it streams from Python to JVM.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR contains slight cleanup.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently we're sending 100 batches instead of 100 rows within a batch when we output the results, meaning that we will send 100 iterators from 100 UDTF invocations with different arguments. This is because one row in `BatchedSerializer` is actually one group from one UDTF invocation within a tuple. This PR sets the batch size as 1 for now.\r\n\r\nIdeally we should implement its custom logic to batch them per row-size. However, this requires to define an additional protocol (e.g., to signal which is the end of one UDTF invocation/batch). Therefore, this PR fixes it with a minimized change for now.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, UDTF is not released to the end users yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested.\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-13T03:59:58Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:52:13Z","closed_at":"2023-06-13T06:27:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ba186e2c4624f3506f46952ab7380b29b9102c33","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41563/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41563/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41563/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b6501ec5062b3a2266b9ce3af931bab4f81237a9","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-43798-followup","ref":"SPARK-43798-followup","sha":"b6501ec5062b3a2266b9ce3af931bab4f81237a9","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change brings a small improvement to allow creating SQLMetrics with an arbitrary initial value instead of always using `-1`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis simplifies creating metrics when there's a need for a metric with a starting value other than `-1`. For example, the Delta MERGE INTO implementation creates today different [timing
