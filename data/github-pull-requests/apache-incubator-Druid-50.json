Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for range partitioning on multiple dimensions. It extends on the\r\nconcept and implementation of single dimension range partitioning.\r\n\r\nThe new partition type added is `range` which corresponds to a set of Dimension Range Partition classes. `single_dim` is now treated as a `range` type partition with a single partition dimension.\r\n\r\nThe `start` and `end` values of a `DimensionRangeShardSpec` are represented\r\nby `StringTuples`, where each String in the tuple is the value of a partition dimension.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following could be the start and end values of some shards for\r\npartition dimensions [country, city]:\r\n\r\nShard Number  | Start [country, city] | End [country, city] (exclusive)\r\n----------------|------|-----\r\n1| null | [\"France\", \"Paris\"]\r\n2| [\"France\", \"Paris\"] | [\"UK\", \"London\"]\r\n3| [\"UK\", \"London\"] | null\r\n\r\nThus, `null < [\"France\", \"Paris\"] < [\"UK\", \"London\"] < null`\r\nIn the above shards,\r\n- all rows with no country specified (e.g. the rows [null, null], [null, \"city A\"] ) would exist in shard 1\r\n- all rows for country \"Algeria\" would exist in shard 1\r\n- all rows for country \"Italy\" would exist in shard 2\r\n- all rows for country \"Zimbabwe\" would exist in shard 3\r\n\r\nPlease note:\r\n- `null` is used to represent both overall start and overall end (same as current behaviour for single_dim)\r\n- `null` is used to mark the overall start/end whereas a tuple of nulls (e.g. `[null, null]`)\r\n    can be a valid tuple of dimension values.\r\n- After the changes here, `single_dim` would be treated as a special case of `range`. \r\n- The single dimension classes have been retained for backward compatibility\r\n   but all new/existing code must use the new DimensionRange partition classes.\r\n- Partitioning done with type `range` and a single partition dimension would still create shard specs\r\n   of type `single_dim`\r\n\r\nFor API compatibility, the following partition specs are equivalent:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"single_dim\",\r\n  \"partitionDimension\": \"dim1\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"range\",\r\n  \"partitionDimensions\": [\"dim1\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Major Code Changes\r\n * Add `StringTuple` to represent the tuple of dimension values in an `InputRow`\r\n * Add `DimensionRangePartitionsSpec`, super class of `SingleDimensionPartitionsSpec`\r\n * Add `DimensionRangeShardSpec`, super class of `SingleDimensionShardSpec`\r\n * Add `DimensionRangeBucketShardSpec`, `BuildingDimensionRangeShardSpec`\r\n * Create instances of `DimensionRangeBucketShardSpec` when bucketing rows into partitions in\r\n   `RangePartitionAnalysis`\r\n * Use `StringTuple` instead of `String` when creating partition ranges\r\n * In `DimensionRangeShardSpec`, check ranges of only the first dimension when pruning partitions\r\n\r\n## Changes not in this PR\r\n- Multi dim partitioning changes for indexing-hadoop classes\r\n\r\n## Changes in follow up PR\r\n- Docs changes for the new multi dim partitioning\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nCVE descriptions are found in https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37136 and https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37137. For netty 3, I suppressed these CVEs since we don't support either Snappy or Bzip2 AFAIT. For netty 4, it seems that we use it only for `HttpPostEmitter` which supports only Gzip. But I bumped its version anyway since it's a minor version update. The security vulnerability check still fails because of https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32626, but I would like to handle it in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been

has been possible in the native query system for a while, but the capability\r\nhasn't yet propagated into the SQL layer. One example of where this is useful is\r\na query like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  SELECT * FROM (... LIMIT X) WHERE <filter>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause this expands the kinds of subquery structures the SQL layer will consider,\r\nit was also necessary to improve the cost calculations. These changes appear in\r\nPartialDruidQuery and DruidOuterQueryRel. The ideas are:\r\n\r\n- Attach per-column penalties to the output signature of each query, instead of to\r\n  the initial projection that starts a query. This encourages moving projections\r\n  into subqueries instead of leaving them on outer queries.\r\n- Only attach penalties to projections if there are actually expressions happening.\r\n  So, now, projections that simply reorder or remove fields are free.\r\n- Attach a constant penalty to every outer query. This discourages creating them\r\n  when they are not needed.\r\n\r\nThe changes are generally beneficial to the test cases we have in CalciteQueryTest.\r\nMost plans are unchanged, or are changed in purely cosmetic ways. Two have changed\r\nfor the better:\r\n\r\n- testUsingSubqueryWithLimit now returns a constant from the subquery, instead of\r\n  returning every column.\r\n- testJoinOuterGroupByAndSubqueryHasLimit returns a minimal set of columns from\r\n  the innermost subquery; two unnecessary columns are no longer there.","created_at":"2021-10-22T20:02:06Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T07:41:00Z","closed_at":"2021-10-24T00:18:43Z","merged_at":"2021-10-24T00:18:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"d4cace385fa8f314a947aae4d9b55d0ef71cb111","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":690563172,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMxNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20SQL","name":"Area

Description\r\nCurrently, Druid only supports `STRING` typed dictionary encoded columns, which are currently necessary to support utilizing bitmap indexes for fast filtering, meaning that only `STRING` columns can be indexed in this manner.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a lot of structure that isn't really specific to `String` types that can be extracted, so this PR begins this process of pulling out common structure to make generic so that someday we can support additional types of dictionary encoded columns, including `LONG` and even `COMPLEX`.\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR should be limited to moving stuff around and the occasional change of `String` to some generic parameter, and most of the code has been pulled out of either `StringDimensionIndexer` or `StringDimensionMergerV9`. The exception to this is spatial indexes, which are fairly coupled to string columns in a section that is not. I captured this with a new `ExtendedIndexesMerger` interface which `DictionaryEncodedColumnMerger` calls when merging indexes, and `StringDimensionMergerV9` implements a `SpatialIndexesMerger` to merge the string spatial indexes. \r\n\r\nI believe that there is probably additional methods which could be pushed down, particularly for the `DictionaryEncodedColumnIndexer` such as dimension selector creation, but I have not done it at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, i have removed `IndexSeeker` from `IndexMerger` since it was duplicated in `StringDimensionMergerV9` and not used anywhere.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DictionaryEncodedColumnIndexer`\r\n * `DictionaryEncodedColumnMerger`\r\n * `DictionaryMergingIterator`\r\n * `DimensionDictionary`\r\n * `SortedDimensionDictionary`\r\n * `StringDimensionIndexer`\r\n * `StringDimensionMergerV9`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests

Description\r\n\r\nFixes a number of annoying issues in preparation for request trailers and the query profile.\r\n\r\n* Converts keys from an enum to classes for smaller code\r\n* Wraps stored values in functions for easier capture for other uses\r\n* Reworks the \"header squeezer\" to handle types other than arrays.\r\n* Uses metadata for visibility, and ability to compress, to replace ad-hoc code.\r\n* Cleans up JSON serialization for the response context.\r\n* Other miscellaneous cleanup.\r\n\r\nBased on a prototype by Gian.\r\n\r\n#### Preparing for response trailers and query profile\r\n\r\nThe query profile work needs a way to return profile information at the completion of a query. It turns out Gian had prototyped just such a mechanism. To do that, he modified the response context to make it clear which fields are returned in the trailer vs. the header. vs. not at all.\r\n\r\nThe query profile will use the response context as a \"back door\" to sneak metrics information out of each `QueryRunner.run()` call. This PR contains just the refactoring done by those projects without the additional complexity of the actual trailer or profile code.\r\n\r\n#### Key metadata\r\n\r\n`ResponseContext` provides a set of key values that define the values allowed in the the context. It seems that those values were originally for a small set of request header values, but grew over time to include internal-only values. With the addition of the response trailer (coming in a later PR), we'll also have footer values.\r\n\r\nWe have code that knows which names should be in the header and picks those out. However, extensions can add keys, which makes a hard-code approach brittle. This PR adds metadata to each key to identify its visibility. (Based on work originally done by Gian.)\r\n\r\n#### Expanded header truncation support\r\n\r\nThe code can drop (or truncate) header fields. The code hard-codes those fields that can be truncated, and assumes they are arrays. This PR adds the \"droppable\" state as metadata in the key, and handles non-array fields when dropping. This ensures that extensions get the same \"droppable\" behavior as core code.\r\n\r\n#### Keys as classes, not enums\r\n\r\nKeys are defined as an enum. Enums define a fixed set of values. Yet, we allow extensions to \"extend\" the set of keys. In this case, it is easier to define keys as objects not in an enum.\r\n\r\nWith this move, we can simplify key definitions. Enum values can't be instances of a class. But, with the additional responsibilities placed on keys, the enum structured forced quite a bit of redundant code. Changing keys to objects let's us use the usual code reuse techniques to avoid redundancy.\r\n\r\n#### Explicit accessors\r\n\r\nThe code to use the response context usually looks like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nresponseContext.add(ResponseContext.Key.CPU_CONSUMED_NANOS, cpuTimeNs);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is rather verbose. And, if we wanted to capture the value for use in, say, metrics, we'd have to hunt down all the places that update the response context and add code to update metrics. This PR provides accessors instead:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nresponseContext.addCpuNanos(cpuTimeNs);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Release notes\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the the `ResponseContext` and it's keys in a breaking way. Any extension that used the prior way to add keys to the response context will need to change the code a bit. However, such changes should be simple.\r\n\r\nThe prior version of the response context suggested that keys be defined in an enum, then registered. This version suggests that keys be defined as objects, then registered. See the `ResponseContext` class itself for the details.\r\n\r\nNote that this change *does not* impact any extension unless that extension adds customer response context keys.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

code, utilities, tests, and documentation for reading data from Druid using Spark.\r\n\r\n(See #10920  and #11474 for context)\r\n\r\nThis PR splits out the reader logic from #10920 into a standalone PR as discussed. This PR also reworks how the connector handles segment loading to allow for more extensibility.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a high level, this connector reads data from Druid into Spark by querying the Druid metadata SQL server for the segment load specs for the specified data source and time period and then fetching and loading those segments from deep storage. On the Spark side, querying the Druid cluster and determining which segments to load is done on the driver side, while the actual fetching and loading of segment files is done on the executors.\r\n\r\nA more granular walk-through follows:\r\n\r\n#### Determining which segments to load\r\n\r\nWhen a user calls `.load()` to read in a Druid data source into a Spark DataFrame, the first step for the connector is to determine which segments need to be read. This is done by querying a Druid cluster's backing metadata database for the specified data source and time range via the `DruidMetadataClient` (we need to query the backing SQL database directly because segment load specs are pruned when served from the broker). Additionally, if the user does not provide a schema for the data source, we need to construct the correct schema ourselves. We do this via SegmentMetadata queries sent to a Druid broker.\r\n\r\n##### Key Classes\r\n`DruidDataSourceReader`\r\n`DruidMetadataClient`\r\n`DruidClient` (already reviewed in #11474)\r\n\r\n#### Distributing the segments\r\n\r\nOnce we've determined which Druid segments we need to load, we need to assign the segments to Spark partitions that will actually do the reading. For now, we simply assign each Druid segment file to a Spark partition, although in the future this could be extended to do smarter things (for instance, we could map multiple Druid segments to a single Spark partition and thus allow the user to specify how many Spark partitions they wanted their DataFrame to have, regardless of the number of underlying Druid segment files).\r\n\r\n##### Key Classes\r\n`DruidDataSourceReader` (the `PlanInputPartition` methods)\r\n`DruidInputPartition`\r\n\r\n#### Reading the data\r\n\r\nOnce we've assigned a Druid segment file to a Spark partition, we need to actually fetch the segment file from deep storage and read its data. This is handled by an `InputPartitionReader` (`DruidInputPartitionReader` for row-based reads; `DruidColumnarInputPartitionReader` for vectorized reads). Using either default or custom, user-provided logic the input partition reader pulls the segment file from deep storage and opens it as a Druid QueryableIndex. The reader then applies any pushed-down filters, projects the specified columns (if the user provided a schema explicitly), and fills Spark rows or vectors with the segment's data.\r\n\r\nA key piece here (and an enhancement from #10920) is the logic used to pull the segment file from deep storage. There are two supported approaches: by default, the partition reader will attempt to deserialize the load spec for it assigned segment and delegate to a Druid DataSegmentPuller to handle fetching. This requires a user to configure the reader with all necessary properties to connect and authenticate to their deep storage, but all Druid \"core\" deep storages (local, HDFS, S3, GCS, and Azure) are supported. Alternatively, users can defer to their Spark application's configuration. In this scenario, the reader extracts a URI from it's assigned segment's load spec and then constructs a FileSystem from the Spark application's configuration. The reader uses the file system to pull the extracted URI, meaning that users are not responsible for handling connection and authentication to deep storage. This second case is useful for users running on clusters that rely on GCS ADCs or AWS IAM roles for machine authorization to GCS/S3, or for clusters that manage access keys for their users. Only local, HDFS, S3, and GCS deep storage implementation are supported out of the box for this approach (Azure users will need to use the first approach or register a custom load function via the `SegmentReaderRegistry`).\r\n\r\n##### Key Classes\r\n`DruidBaseInputPartitionReader`\r\n`DruidColumnarInputPartitionReader`\r\n`DruidInputPartitionReader`\r\n`SegmentReaderRegistry`\r\n\r\n#### User interface\r\n\r\nUsers use the connector like any other Spark reader: they call `.read` on their Spark session, set the format (in this case, `\"druid\"`), specify the properties to use, and then call `load()`. For example:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nsparkSession\r\n  .read\r\n  .format(\"druid\")\r\n  .options(Map[String, String](\r\n    \"metadata.dbType\" -> \"mysql\",\r\n    \"metadata.connectUri\" -> \"jdbc:mysql://druid.metadata.server:3306/druid\",\r\n    \"metadata.user\" -> \"druid\",\r\n    \"metadata.password\" -> \"diurd\",\r\n    \"broker.host\" -> \"localhost\",\r\n    \"broker.port\" -> 8082,\r\n    \"table\" -> \"dataSource\",\r\n    \"reader.deepStorageType\" -> \"local\",\r\n    \"local.storageDirectory\" -> \"/mnt/druid/druid-segments/\"\r\n))\r\n  .load()\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor convenience, a more strongly typed way to apply configure the reader is also provided:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.druid.spark.DruidDataFrameReader\r\n\r\nval deepStorageConfig = new LocalDeepStorageConfig().storageDirectory(\"/mnt/druid/druid-segments/\")\r\n\r\nsparkSession\r\n  .read\r\n  .brokerHost(\"localhost\")\r\n  .brokerPort(8082)\r\n  .metadataDbType(\"mysql\")\r\n  .metadataUri(\"jdbc:mysql://druid.metadata.server:3306/druid\")\r\n  .metadataUser(\"druid\")\r\n  .metadataPassword(\"diurd\")\r\n  .dataSource(\"dataSource\")\r\n  .deepStorage(deepStorageConfig)\r\n  .druid()\r\n```\r\n\r\nUser documentation with examples and configuration option descriptions is provided in [spark.md](docs/operations/spark.md).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, because the connector does not run in a Druid cluster, we can't use Druid's dependency injection to transparently handle custom extensions and behavior. In order to support users who use unsupported or custom complex metrics, deep storage implementations, or metadata databases, the connector uses a plugin-based architecture. All Druid core extensions are supported out of the box. If users need to use their own custom logic, they can register the appropriate functions with the corresponding registry (`ComplexMetricRegistry` for complex metrics, `SQLConnectorRegistry` for metadata databases, and `SegmentReaderRegistry` for loading segments from deep storage).\r\n\r\n##### Key Classes\r\n`ComplexMetricRegistry`\r\n`SQLConnectorRegistry`\r\n`SegmentReaderRegistry`\r\n`DruidConfigurationKeys`\r\n`spark.md`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

#11718 and #11680 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\nChanging the required permission level for ALL Supervisor and Task APIs may break existing\r\nautomation that users might have set up.\r\n\r\nThe motivation behind the above mentioned changes were to prevent leakage of sensitive\r\ninformation through these APIs. But there are other workarounds to prevent that, such as \r\nusing `EnvironmentVariableDynamicConfigProvider` to provide passwords and secrets.\r\n\r\nWhile the above mentioned changes do prevent such leakage of information, they do so\r\nat the cost of unreasonable restrictions on even purely informative APIs. The original changes\r\nalso remove the possibility of having a user who needs to view Supervisor and Task information\r\nbut should not have permission to ingest data, modify compaction configuration etc. These are\r\ntypically support users managing a cluster. \r\n\r\nKeeping these arguments in mind, the changes are being reverted. A better solution to these\r\nproblems would be a more granular auth model in Druid.\r\n\r\n### Changes being reverted\r\n\r\n- Check Datasource WRITE in SystemSchema for tables \"supervisors\" and \"tasks\"\r\n- Check Datasource WRITE for APIs /supervisor/history and /supervisor/{id}/history\r\n- Check Datasource for all Indexing Task APIs\r\n- Always require DATASOURCE WRITE access in SupervisorResourceFilter and TaskResourceFilter\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `PostAggregator` interface defines a method `getType` which returns a `ColumnType` for use when populating a `RowSignature`. Many `PostAggregator` implementations have fixed return types, and are so independent of the underlying `RowSignature`, but some, such as `FieldAccessPostAggregator` and `ExpressionAggregator`, are sensitive to their inputs.\r\n\r\nCurrently these dynamic return type `PostAggregator` implementations are unable to produce an output type until they have been `decorated` which provides access to a map of column names to `AggregatorFactory`, which provide their own type information. The only place using the output type of `PostAggregators` is `RowSignature`, so if we modify the `getType` method to accept a `ColumnInspector`, we can compute the output prior to decoration, if the `RowSignature` provides itself as the `ColumnInspector`.\r\n\r\nThe `ExpressionPostAggregator` was missing an output type completely, despite the fact that Druid expression system for some time now has been able to infer the output type of an expression if the inputs to all of its free variables are known, so it has been updated to support producing the output type from either the inspector, _or_ from the `decorate` method, if it has been called.\r\n\r\nI also updated `FieldAccessPostAggregator` to be able to compute it's output type from the `ColumnInspector` if decorate has not been called, but did not yet do `FinalizingFieldAccessPostAggregator`, as I think we would need a clearer split between intermediary and finalized `RowSignature` that is not yet in place.\r\n\r\nI left the 'decoration computes type' pattern in place, and the code prefers those over the `ColumnInspector` computed types because I wasn't completely sure if there would be any consequences to this, but it might very be possible to remove them from these aggregators in the future if it isn't needed.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `PostAggregator`\r\n *

This doesn't seem to work in Kubernetes if the execution context is within the container. Also this isn't consistent across all Linux OSes. The fix is to fallback to `/` as the root and it seems to work empirically.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\nThere are 3 types of query IDs - id, subQueryId, sqlQueryId. Currently, whenever a query generates subqueries, the subquery's subQueryId is populated randomly. Also, subquery's Id is not set to the parent query Id. Therefore there is no way of linking the subqueries to the parent query, and one loses the ability to look at end to end view of the query.  \r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\nThis PR aims to implement following couple of things:\r\n1. Populate the subqueries with it's parent's id (and sqlQueryId if present)\r\n2. Populate the subqueryId such that it forms a hierarchical relationship amongs themselves. For example, if there is a query which launches a subquery, which in turn launches a couple of subqueries, then the ids and subQueryIds should have following structure.\r\n```\r\nParent Query: { queryId: \"my-query-id\", subQueryId: null }\r\n    Sub Query: { queryId: \"my-query-id\", subQueryId: \"1\" }\r\n        Sub Sub Query: { queryId: \"my-query-id\", subQueryId: \"1-1\" }\r\n        Sub Sub Query: { queryId: \"my-query-id\", subQueryId: \"1-2\" }\r\n```\r\nCurrently this is the implementation of the subQueryId generation. Each of the subquery generated is assigned the ID of the level that datasource resides in the original query.\r\n1. In case of a subquery which needs to be inlined: It will get assigned the nesting level of the Subquery Datasource under the original datasource where it resides.\r\n2. In case of an union query: The runner will invoke the query with the individual datasources where subquery Id is assigned to the nesting level of these datasources.\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

provides a pre-push hook to git to perform code style checking when pushing code branch to remote servers.Since there're more than 60 modules in Druid, the checking sometimes are a little bit slow. \r\n\r\nSince `mvn` command supports `-T` parameter to run tasks in multiple threads, by adding this parameter to the pre-push hook, we can save a lot of time when pushing code to remote servers.\r\n\r\nHere's the time consumption using the old command\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  14.270 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-10-18T12:01:21+08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nand after adding thread count parameter to the checking command, the time is decreased by more than 50%.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  6.037 s (Wall Clock)\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2021-10-18T13:16:37+08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n

#11789.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAdded an optional flag `rowArray` to the JSON input format to treat the input as an array of row objects, rather than individual objects. This is meant to facilitate ingesting data from REST APIs, which often return single JSON elements instead of whitespace-separated objects.\r\n\r\nTested with the nano quickstart using both sample data sets in the documentation.\r\n\r\nNote: I wasn't sure of the best name to give this flag. I am open to suggestions.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `JsonInputFormat`\r\n * `JsonReader`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nthis change ensures that `JettyTest` is setting the properties it needs in case some other test overwrites them\r\nIt also changes up the ordering of the call for `setProperties` to call super's first in case super is setting the same property as the class setting it.\r\n\r\nI could have changed the `JettyWithResponseFilterEnabledTest` to clean up after itself, but some other test could come in and do a similar change and break `JettyTest` again. By making `JettyTest` in charge of its own dependencies it is a more resilient test.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `JettyTest`\r\n * `JettyWithResponseFilterEnabledTest`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n`S3InputSource` presently provides an option to override the default S3 credentials which is useful to read from different buckets, but it has to be in the same endpoint. This PR adds functionality to specify a different endpoint and associated client properties as part of the `S3InputSource` spec. This can be helpful for operators looking to migrate data from one store to another. This is implemented only for S3 at the moment, but we can support other cloud providers as a followup.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `S3InputSource`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Most of the details are captured in #11791 . \r\nWe use a combination of maven profiles and resource filtering to achieve this. Hadoop2 is supported by default and a new maven profile with the name hadoop3 is created. This will allow the user to choose the profile which is best suited for the use case.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\n\r\nDruid currently has 2 serverViews, regular serverView and filtered serverView. The regular serverView is used to monitor all segment announcements from all data nodes (historicals, tasks, indexers). The filtered serverView is used when you want to watch segment announcements from particular tiers. Since these server views keep track of different sets of druidServers and segments in memory, they should be maintained separately. However, they currently share the same name for their executorService, which can cause confusion and make debugging harder especially in the broker since it is using both serverViews, the filtered view for normal query processing and the regular view to serve the `servers` table (I'm unsure whether this is intended or whether this is a good behavior). This PR changes it to a more obvious name. \r\n\r\nThis PR also removes `SingleServerInventoryView`. This view was deprecated a long time ago and has not been documented at least since 0.13 (https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6127). I also don't think this can be better in any case than `BatchServerInventoryView`. Finally, I merged `AbstractCuratorServerInventoryView` and `BatchServerInventoryView` as we no longer need `AbstractCuratorServerInventoryView` after `SingleServerInventoryView` is removed.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `BatchServerInventoryViewProvider`/`FilteredBatchServerInventoryViewProvider`\r\n *

It also improves the unit tests for BalanceSegments test by adding an EasyMock.verify() call to the mocked BalancerStrategy object. This will ensure that our expected strategy method calls that are mocked in the tests are actually called as expected.~\r\n\r\nRefactor BalanceSegments#balanceServers to exit early if there is no balancing work to be done.

Description\r\n\r\nThe new config is an extension of the concept of \"watchedTiers\" where\r\nthe Broker can choose to add the info of only the specified tiers to its timeline.\r\nSimilarly, with this config, Broker can choose to ignore the segments being served\r\nby the specified historical tiers. By default, no tier is ignored.\r\n\r\nThis config is useful when you want a completely isolated tier amongst many other tiers.\r\n\r\nSay there are several tiers of historicals Tier T1, Tier T2 ... Tier Tn\r\nand there are several brokers Broker B1, Broker B2 .... Broker Bm\r\n\r\nIf we want only Broker B1 to query Tier T1, instead of setting a long list of `watchedTiers`\r\non each of the other Brokers B2 ... Bm, we could just set `druid.broker.segment.ignoredTiers=[\"T1\"]`\r\nfor these Brokers, while Broker B1 could have `druid.broker.segment.watchedTiers=[\"T1\"]`\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Add new config `druid.broker.segment.ignoredTiers`\r\n- Filter servers in BrokerServerView based on whether the tiers are ignored or not\r\n- Add check that at most only one of `ignoredTiers` or `watchedTiers` is configured, fail otherwise\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Description\r\nAdd different ways to collect CPU availability information. This PR gets information from cpu/cpuset cgroups and from /proc/cpuinfo. Also adds 2 more cgroup monitors to emit this info.\r\n\r\nThe motivation here is to improve the way we figure out available processors since Java's `availableProcessors` implementation doesn't account for fractional quotas, effective CPU sets and shares. This becomes especially important in containerized setups like Kubernetes. Eventually we will extend `RuntimeInfo` to be smarter and when we move to Java 11, we can swap to the`Metrics` class.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * Added `Cpu` and `CpuSet` to `java.util.metrics.cgroups`\r\n * Added `ProcFsUtil` for procfs info\r\n * Added `CgroupCpuMonitor` and `CgroupCpuSetMonitor`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\n\r\n#9576 added utility functions for integration tests including restarting docker containers. This PR adds a new utility method to kill a container with `SIGKILL` and restart the container. This could be useful for testing certain edge cases where some node is forced to exit without graceful shutdown. I made this method public along with others since the current way providing utility methods for each node doesn't seem scalable.

PR reenables `ITHttpInputSourceTest` and simplifies it to have it use fewer resources. This test started being more flaky, i.e. intermittent failures a few days ago, so it was disabled for debugging. Now it seems fine and passing. But rather than leave it as is it is better to change its ingestion to `dynamic` rather than `hash` so it uses fewer resources. Besides analysis of failures did not indicate anything wrong with the tests and rather the cause was pointing to potential Travis (lack) of resources. This PR also removes the use of sketches during ingestion to further simplify the test without affecting its purpose of testing HTTP input source.\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-29T02:07:59Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T07:41:28Z","closed_at":"2021-10-12T16:51:28Z","merged_at":"2021-10-12T16:51:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"887cecf29e8b813029911fb05745764cce155c94","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1048471070,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDQ4NDcxMDcw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Flaky%20test","name":"Flaky

test has become very unstable recently and it is blocking the development pipeline. Offline debugging indicates that this is potentially a Travis memory limitation issue for docker where due to some reason (Travis change? Software change?) the runtime memory requirement increased to make this test fail. The docker memory issue described above is just a hypothesis based on log interpretation and local tests. Debugging and finding a solution may take some time so I am proposing to ignore this test to unblock the pipeline while I debug this and find a solution. The final solution may include some memory parameter changes and/or some structural changes to the test.\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-28T16:37:31Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T07:42:18Z","closed_at":"2021-09-28T20:42:02Z","merged_at":"2021-09-28T20:42:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"988623b7ae845e588133854b92606e308ad56469","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":303259531,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDMyNTk1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Testing","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nCurrent Integration test uses 1024-bit RSA key to generate certificates for TLS. There're warnings when generating such RSA keys or running docker images. The warnings show as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<druid> uses a 1024-bit RSA key which is considered a security risk. This key size will be disabled in a future update.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese warnings are noisy information when handling IT test case build failures such as #11663 . So I upgrade the length of RSA key from 1024 to 4096 to eliminate all of these warnings.\r\n\r\nThere're also wanings about use of keystore format as follows\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nThe JKS keystore uses a proprietary format. It is recommended to migrate to PKCS12 which is an industry standard format using \"keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore client.jks -destkeystore client.jks -deststoretype pkcs12\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also change the format of keystore from JKS to PKCS12 to eliminate these warnings.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

Description\r\nCurrently JDBC connections to Druid _require_ that the trailing `/` be part of the request url so that it matches exactly, else it will not be handled by the avatica machinery. This isn't very user-friendly, this PR modifies the Avatica endpoint handlers to accept with or without the trailing /, e.g. `/druid/v2/sql/avatica/` or `/druid/v2/sql/avatica` (and also protobuf).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\nThe new config is an extension of the concept of \"watchedTiers\" where\r\nthe Broker can choose to add the info of only the specified tiers to its timeline.\r\nSimilarly, with this config, Broker can choose to skip the realtime nodes and\r\nthus it would query only Historical processes for any given segment.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Add new config `druid.broker.segment.watchRealtimeNodes`\r\n- Filter servers of type REALTIME in `BrokerServerView` based on whether realtime nodes are watched or not\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been

Description\r\nAdds a utility to aid in formatting release notes so that individual features can be linked from github. \r\n\r\nWhen writing release notes, github doesn't generate any sort of link for markdown headers. As a workaround/alternative for this, we have take the practice of writing our markdown headers to look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# <a name=\"22-new-features\" href=\"#22-new-features\">#</a> New features\r\n```\r\nwhich renders a '#' at the start of the header with a link to itself, so that particular header can be directly linked to. This works pretty well, but is quite tedious.\r\n\r\nTo help make this less brutal, I've added a new script, `distribution/bin/make-linkable-release-notes.py`, with usage:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./distribution/bin/make-linkable-release-notes.py 0.22.0 path/to/plain-release-notes.md path/to/formatted-release-notes.md\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not a python wizard, so there are probably cooler ways to do this, and the links it generates can be quite long since it urlencodes the headers by their complete text, nested per header, but it looks like it works ok. Note that I did not use this for this release, but you can see what the current release notes would look like here https://gist.github.com/clintropolis/d94bae4f0b9a7c36dde5750ce0805eb9#0.22.0-new-features (gist seems to render slightly different than github

Description\r\n\r\nWe're using supervisor/task HTTP APIs to manage supervisor and tasks in a independent system. Current supervisor/task  endpoint return 400 when a supervisor or a task is not found. This status code is not friendly and confusing for the 3rd system. And according to the definition of HTTP status code,  404 is right code for such case. So this PR changes the status code from 400 to 404 to eliminate the ambigiuty.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

#11651 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the exception message when using the web console wizard to load data by:\r\n1. catching exception that is thrown when constructing kafka consumer object and then re-throwing a SamplerException which will be automatically mapped to a JSON object by existing `SamplerExceptionMapper`\r\n\r\n2. since `SamplerExceptionMapper` returns the exception message to the client without any stack trace, it's not able to know where the exception comes from, so we also loges the cause of SamplerException to log so that we know where the exception is thrown from server side log\r\n\r\nNow the web-console showes the error as followes:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6525742/133927769-9988e63b-7958-45d5-a74e-5065d36e4100.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets

#11291\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows users to use [JsonPath](https://github.com/jayway/JsonPath) functions  in JsonPath expressions during ingestion. Currently, JsonPath is used to extract values inside a JSON object. However, JsonPath supports a bunch of function expressions which are not supported by Druid now.  For example, '$.property_name.length()' can be used to get the length of a Json array object 'property_name'. This function would be useful in some cases.\r\n\r\nThe reason why Druid does not support JsonPath functions is very simple, the original code assumes that the JsonPath expressions would return a Json object. However, if a JsonPath function is applied, the return type is the raw object instead of Json object.\r\n\r\nSo fixing the bug of 'length()' function also brings support to other functions. I also brings the support of these functions to orc/avro/parquet data format. \r\nFollowing matrix shows the current supported JsonPath functions and corresponding data formats. \r\n\r\n | Function   | Description                                                         | Output type | json | orc | avro | parquet |\r\n  | :----------| :------------------------------------------------------------------ |:----------- |:-----|:----|:-----|:-----|\r\n  | min()      | Provides the min value of an array of numbers                       | Double      | &#10003;  |  &#10003;   |   &#10003;   |  &#10003;   |\r\n  | max()      | Provides the max value of an array of numbers                       | Double      | &#10003;  |  &#10003;   |   &#10003;   |  &#10003;   |\r\n  | avg()      | Provides the average value of an array of numbers                   | Double      | &#10003;  |  &#10003;   |   &#10003;   |  &#10003;   |\r\n  | stddev()   | Provides the standard deviation value of an array of numbers        | Double      | &#10003;  |  &#10003;   |   &#10003;   |  &#10003;   |\r\n  | length()   | Provides the length of an array                                     | Integer     | &#10003;  |  &#10003;   |   &#10003;   |  &#10003;   |\r\n  | sum()      | Provides the sum value of an array of numbers                       | Double      | &#10003;  |  &#10003;   |   &#10003;   |  &#10003;   |\r\n  | concat(X)  | Provides a concatenated version of the path output with a new item  | like input  | &#10003;  |  &#10007;   |   &#10007;   | &#10007;   |\r\n  | append(X)  | add an item to the json path output array                           | like input  | &#10003;  |  &#10007;   |   &#10007;   | &#10007;   |\r\n  | keys()     | Provides the property keys (An alternative for terminal tilde ~)    | Set<E>      | &#10007;  |  &#10007;   |   &#10007;   | &#10007;   |\r\n\r\n- `append`, `concat` are not fully supported, because I don't see there's strong need to use them.\r\n- `keys()` is not supported because it's not supported by current JsonPath library used by Druid. And also I don't see there's a strong need to use this JsonPath function. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nBuilds on top of #11692 to add optional authorization to tables of the `sys` in SQL as `SYSTEM_TABLE` resources, if \r\n the newly added `druid.sql.planner.authorizeSystemTablesDirectly` is true. For backwards compatibility, this feature is off by default. This allows cluster operators to selectively enable access to `sys` schema tables, or even disallow completely while still allowing `SQL` access to Druid datasources (`DATASOURCE` resources).\r\n\r\nBecause of the smooth way things were done in #11692, the actual code change here is pretty small, `NamedSystemSchema` now accepts the `PlannerConfig` so it can optionally return `ResourceType.SYSTEM_TABLE`. The \r\nintegration tests have been configured to now run with this new option enabled, and new authorization tests to cover this new permission. The majority of the changes in this PR are a slight refactoring of the authorization integration tests to share code a bit more effectively (and so I only had to add new tests once), and in fact right now at least this PR removes more lines than it adds even though it is adding new stuff. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-17T18:48:35Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T07:42:25Z","closed_at":"2021-09-21T20:28:26Z","merged_at":"2021-09-21T20:28:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"5de26cf6d9ba94bdfb34ec9fcc76a2e7aa32db79","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":222509152,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjI1MDkxNTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Operations","name":"Area

an issue where a load-drop-load sequence for a segment and historical doesn't work correctly for http based load queue peon. The first cycle of load-drop works fine - the problem comes when there is an attempt to reload the segment. The historical caches load success for some recent segments and makes the reload as a no-op. But it doesn't consider that fact that the segment was also dropped in between the load requests.\r\nThis change invalidates the cache after a client tries to fetch a success result.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

issue of duplicate key  under certain conditions when loading late data in streaming. Also fixes a documentation issue with skipSegmentLineageCheck.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\nScope: the scope is preventing primary key violations in the pending segments and segments table as a result of\r\nnormal Druid operation and API actions. Another permitted operation within scope is reverting compaction/overwrite\r\nby dropping the compacted segment (i.e. killing the compacted segment id allowing for previously overshadowed segments to become available again). This fix covers the existing issue (see repro below) and makes some effort to cover other potential uses.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR enriches the native engine type system to use a more powerful set of classes than the existing enumerations, `ValueType` and `ExprType`, which are primarily used right now.\r\n\r\nThis is the start of a series of changes that will end up with 'complex metrics' being rebranded 'complex types' and being fully usable throughout the query system, including for expressions, grouping, and filtering.\r\n\r\nTo share the same structure and utilities when working with both the native engine and expressions, `TypeSignature` \r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic interface TypeSignature<Type extends TypeDescriptor>\r\n{\r\n  Type getType();\r\n  @Nullable\r\n  String getComplexTypeName();\r\n  @Nullable\r\n  TypeSignature<Type> getElementType();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nhas been added to model basic type information, and is implemented by the new `ColumnType` and `ExpressionType` classes, as well as `ColumnCapabilities`. `TypeDescriptor` is an interface shared by both `ExprType` and `ValueType`,\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic interface TypeDescriptor\r\n{\r\n  boolean isNumeric();\r\n  boolean isPrimitive();\r\n  boolean isArray();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nto expose some common facts about both sets of enums.\r\n\r\nTo aid in the construction of these types:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic interface TypeFactory<T extends TypeSignature<? extends TypeDescriptor>>\r\n{\r\n  T ofString();\r\n  T ofFloat();\r\n  T ofDouble();\r\n  T ofLong();\r\n  T ofArray(T elementType);\r\n  T ofComplex(@Nullable String complexTypeName);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nhas also been added. This is interning the type objects so that they are re-used in the engine to prevent the creation of a large amount of garbage (operating on the assumption that there won't be _that_ many types and that they will be frequently used).\r\n\r\nBeyond these new structures, the vast majority of changes in this PR are around replacing all occurrences of `ValueType` with `ColumnType`, and `ExprType` with `ExpressionType`, and adjusting type checking code accordingly.\r\n\r\n## JSON Serialization\r\nTo be as compatible as possible, serialization is currently done with a string based format. `LONG`, `STRING`, `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE` all remain the same as they were when `ValueType` was king, and serde as the appropriate `ColumnType` (or `ExpressionType`). \r\n\r\nArray types have been significantly reworked to take advantage of the new structure: instead of dedicated typed arrays, `LONG_ARRAY` etc, `ValueType` and `ExprType` now have a single `ARRAY` type, and `elementType` contains a reference to the internal type. In the string serialized form, these now look like `ARRAY<LONG>`, `ARRAY<STRING>`, etc, but can translate the legacy values if encountered.\r\n\r\nFinally, `COMPLEX` will read into an unknown complex type, but if the type information is present, will serialize as `COMPLEX<typeName>`.\r\n\r\nI've added object JSON constructors too, in order to prepare for a future where we might want to use objects instead of this string based serde, but the strings are adequately flexible for now I think, since it will be possible to model all sorts of types that were not possible in the previous system, such as `ARRAY<ARRAY<COMPLEX<typeName>>` if we want to get wild with it.\r\n\r\n## SQL and INFORMATION_SCHEMA\r\nThe only change in this PR that will be apparent to most users is that now that complex type information is preserved through-out the engine, the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` columns table can display the complex type information instead of `OTHER`:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1169\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-09-04 at 6 48 41 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/133430337-62899b34-9e05-4b37-a63f-54dcfa1f6029.png\">\r\n\r\nThe JDBC type for complex is still reported as `OTHER` because i need to do some additional investigation on if there is anything more appropriate (it has to be something in `java.sql.Types`, but we could possibly consider setting the classname to the complex type instead of `java.lang.Object`, I need to better learn the rules about how JDBC is supposed to behave)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Future work\r\nI think there is quite a lot of stuff we can do once this PR goes in, here is the short list of most immediate things I can think of.\r\n\r\n### Complex expressions\r\nThis is likely to be one of the first follow-up PRs I do after this, since the new type system will support making complex expressions, which is one of the last feature gaps of the expression system. After this there will be very little that cannot be done with expressions that is supported by the native engine.\r\n\r\n### Better input validation\r\nThere is a lot we could do after this PR to take advantage of the additional information it makes available. SQL planning and aggregator factories could both take advantage of the preserved complex type information to perform better validation on their inputs, and better behavior or error messaging whenever inappropriate types have been used. Similarly, this additional type information also should make it easier to make complex aggregator factories which are not split into separate build and merge factories since we should have adequate type information to be able to build the correct type of aggregator by examining the input type information.\r\n\r\n### Better arrays\r\nThe updated type system in this PR supports modeling nested arrays and arrays of complex types, but the array expressions have not been updated to actually create or support them.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ValueType`\r\n * `ExprType`\r\n * `TypeDescriptor`\r\n * `TypeFactory`\r\n * `TypeSignature`\r\n * `ColumnType`\r\n * `ColumnTypeFactory`\r\n * `ExpressionType`\r\n * `ExpressionTypeFactory`\r\n * `ColumnCapabilities`\r\n * `RowSignature`\r\n * `Calcites`\r\n * `RowSignatures`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

new config to filter internal Druid-related messages from Query API response\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the following new config: `druid.server.http.sanitizeJettyErrorResponse` and `druid.server.http.sanitizeDruidErrorResponse.strategy`\r\n\r\nThese configs will allow Druid API responses to hide internal information (class name, stack trace, internal concept, thread name / servlet name, code, line/column number, host/ip). This is useful for when we have external users using Druid query API.\r\n\r\nFor the initial functionality of this feature, we will handle the following Query API responses:\r\n- Jetty layer / Jetty filter (authentication filter, cannot route/connect to downstream services, limit request, http allow method, etc.)\r\n- In AsyncQueryForwardingServlet of the Router\r\n- SqlResource (/druid/v2/sql/ POST endpoint)\r\n\r\nThe effect of this feature for each layer is described below:\r\n- Without `druid.server.http.sanitizeJettyErrorResponse` enabled, any error in the Jetty layer / Jetty filter will have `\"servlet\"`, `\"message\"`, `\"url\"`, `\"status\"` and `\"cause\"` fields in the JSON response. With `druid.server.http.sanitizeJettyErrorResponse` enabled, the JSON response will only contains `\"message\"`, `\"url\"`, and `\"status\"`. Note that the value of these fields remain unchanged.\r\n- AsyncQueryForwardingServlet of the Router error Response is changed from a map containing only \"error\" field to the same format as SqlResource/QueryResource (using QueryException). The error response will have the field `\"error\"`, `\"errorMessage\"`, `\"errorClass\"`, and `\"host\"` (as described in https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/querying.html#query-execution-failures). This change apply to both when the new config is not set and when set. \r\n- Without `druid.server.http.sanitizeDruidErrorResponse.strategy` set or set to `none`, any error in AsyncQueryForwardingServlet of the Router and SqlResource (/druid/v2/sql/ POST endpoint) will have the field `\"error\"`, `\"errorMessage\"`, `\"errorClass\"`, and `\"host\"` (as described in https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/querying.html#query-execution-failures). When `druid.server.http.sanitizeDruidErrorResponse.strategy` is set,  the field `\"errorClass\"`, and `\"host\"` will always be null. Moreover, the field `\"errorMessage\"` will be transformed based on the set strategy. Currently, this PR only includes one strategy which is based on allowedRegex. Basically, the value of the field `\"errorMessage\"` will be checked against a list of regular expressions in `druid.server.http.sanitizeDruidErrorResponse.allowedRegex`. If the value match any of the regular expressions, then it will be included in the response, otherwise it will be null. Note that the value of the field `\"error\"` will remain unchanged.  (Note that prior to this PR `\"errorMessage\"`, `\"errorClass\"`, and `\"host\"` can be null)\r\n\r\nFuture work:\r\nWe can reuse this config and apply it to other Query API such as Native query and JDBC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-15T09:17:00Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T07:42:16Z","closed_at":"2021-09-29T05:55:49Z","merged_at":"2021-09-29T05:55:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"a04b08e45ce82c6c27eca94b735e624349846bc5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area
