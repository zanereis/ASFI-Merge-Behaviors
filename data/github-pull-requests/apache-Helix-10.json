It first \"lists\", which gets all the ZNodes, and then it \"updates\" by comparing ZNode metadata to determine which ZNodes have been changed. Job enqueue is also a two step procedure, where it adds all JobConfigs one by one, and update WorkflowConfig's DAG in the end.  \r\n\r\nIf selective update \"lists\" before all JobConfigs are added, and \"updates\" after the WorkflowConfig is done updating, it's possible to read in a DAG containing more jobs than JobConfigs that are seen by selective update. This causes TaskGarbageCollection to remove the jobs that are \"missing\" JobConfigs, even though their JobConfigs actually exist. This PR implements a workaround for determining expired jobs while avoiding this case of cache \"phantom read\": if JobConfig doesn't exist in the cache, check ZK directly.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1234, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 4,885.942 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testPeriodicRefresh(org.apache.helix.integration.spectator.TestRoutingTableProviderPeriodicRefresh)  Time elapsed: 2.022 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<4> but was:<3>\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.spectator.TestRoutingTableProviderPeriodicRefresh.testPeriodicRefresh(TestRoutingTableProviderPeriodicRefresh.java:214)\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestRoutingTableProviderPeriodicRefresh.testPeriodicRefresh:214 expected:<4> but was:<3>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1234, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:21 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-10-21T12:14:46-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1459 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIf a reply message doesn't have a corresponding callback, AsyncCallbackService will raise an exception when creating a handler for it. Since stale reply messages may happen during participant reconnects, some customers prefer not seeing too verbose error messages since they don't require any actions of debugging. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a less verbose (no stacktrace) HelixException and raises it for this specific case. It may also be used in other occasions if necessary.  \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1213, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 4,830.531 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testPeriodicRefresh(org.apache.helix.integration.spectator.TestRoutingTableProviderPeriodicRefresh)  Time elapsed: 2.031 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<4> but was:<3>\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.spectator.TestRoutingTableProviderPeriodicRefresh.testPeriodicRefresh(TestRoutingTableProviderPeriodicRefresh.java:214)\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestRoutingTableProviderPeriodicRefresh.testPeriodicRefresh:214 expected:<4> but was:<3>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1213, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:20 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-10-12T16:36:07-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n#1453 Race condition cause Timer leak in GenericHelixController\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWe found a periodic rebalance's Timer leakage issue during log analysis. In current startPeriodRebalance, two thread may interference with each other. This may result in one timer got canceled twice, two timers are created with one timer leaked. \r\n\r\n```\r\n  void startPeriodRebalance(long period, HelixManager manager) {\r\n    if (period != _timerPeriod) {\r\n      logger.info(\"Controller starting periodical rebalance timer at period \" + period);\r\n      if (_periodicalRebalanceTimer != null) {\r\n        _periodicalRebalanceTimer.cancel();                  <<<------ \r\n      } \r\n      _periodicalRebalanceTimer =\r\n          new Timer(\"GenericHelixController_\" + _clusterName + \"_periodical_Timer\", true);     <<<-----\r\n     ......\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThis PR changes Timer to use a SingleThreadScheduledExecutor and adds a synchronized block in start/stop PeriodRebalance.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestRoutingTableProviderPeriodicRefresh.testPeriodicRefresh:214 expected:<4> but was:<3>\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1234, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:23 h\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nfix #1454 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently selective update can result in \"phantom read\". For\r\nexample, when job1 cfg is added and then workflow cfg\r\ncontaining job 1 is updated. The selective update may only\r\nsee updated workflow cfg but not job 1 cfg. This would cause\r\njob1 cfg and ctx removed. THus hanging tests.\r\n\r\nCurrently we work around this issue by setting purge interval\r\nto -1 and enhance logging in task to make test stable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nrunning\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n    HelixClusterVerifier verify() and related method may return\r\n    pre-maturely. The reason is that the verify the converging stable\r\n    condition too early before controller has a chance to make\r\n    change. Basically the previous stable state is mistaken as the\r\n    expected next stable state.\r\n    \r\n    We fix this issue by adding waitTillVerify() timeout in\r\n    construction time of verifier.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\ngithub run https://github.com/apache/helix/runs/1222609480?check_suite_focus=true\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n2020-10-07T21:51:30.9005474Z \r\n2020-10-07T21:51:31.3163346Z [ERROR] Failures: \r\n2020-10-07T21:51:31.3164350Z [ERROR]   TestDisableCustomCodeRunner.test:236 expected:<false> but was:<true>\r\n2020-10-07T21:51:31.3187463Z [ERROR]   TestTaskRebalancer.testNamedQueue » ThreadTimeout Method org.testng.internal.T...\r\n2020-10-07T21:51:31.3189714Z [ERROR]   TestHelixAdminCli.testInstanceOperations:469 » Helix Failed to drop instance: ...\r\n2020-10-07T21:51:31.3190815Z [ERROR] Tests run: 1212, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 4\r\n2020-10-07T21:51:31.3310693Z [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:3.0.0-M3:test (default-test) on project helix-core: There are test failures.\r\n2020-10-07T21:51:31.3311431Z [ERROR] \r\n2020-10-07T21:51:31.3312114Z [ERROR] Please refer to /home/runner/work/helix/helix/helix-core/target/surefire-reports for the individual test results.\r\n2020-10-07T21:51:31.3312933Z [ERROR] Please refer to dump files (if any exist) [date].dump, [date]-jvmRun[N].dump and [date].dumpstream.\r\n2020-10-07T21:51:31.3313549Z [ERROR] -> [Help 1]\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nfix #1446 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nQuite some unit test still use Thread.sleep(xxx) to wait for a\r\ncondition to happen. This is a source of falkiness of test. This\r\nmay also make the test running unnecessarily long. We address\r\nthis issue with TestHelper.verify() method.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/runs/1218717184?check_suite_focus=true\r\nSee above link. All test passed.\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1353 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nSince we allow negative delay in `scheduleRebalance`, which leads to immediate rebalance (on-demand), the current logic is incorrect. When job purge interval is non-positive, a rebalance is always triggered immediately. \r\n\r\nAdding a check earlier to disable the rebalance triggering when job purge interval is non-positive. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[WARNING] Tests run: 1210, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 4,007.762 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[WARNING] Tests run: 1210, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:06 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-10-05T17:04:49-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixed #1435 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn customized state provider, there is a local variable of Helix data accessor, which is get from Helix manager. When Helix manager disconnect and reconnect, the data accessor is actually stale. \r\nThe reason is that when a Helix manager reconnects, it instantiates a new data accessor, but the data accessor in state provider still points to the old object, whose zkclient is already closed. So we should explicitly get the data accessor from Helix manager each time we need to use it in customized state provider.\r\n\r\nAnother change is in group commit, currently it throws an exception when zkclinet is closed, and this is different from other updateProperty calls, which returns an error code. We change it to have the same behavior. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nhelix-core\r\n[WARNING] Tests run: 1210, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 3,972.81 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[WARNING] Tests run: 1210, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:06 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-10-05T18:53:46-07:00\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n(Fixes #1319  )\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nA small addition of Maven dependencies to make Apache Helix build successfully on Java 11 and above out-of-the-box.  The core issue is that, as of Java 11, some legacy J2EE-related packages such as javax.annotation.* and javax.xml.bind.* have been removed from the JDK, but the helix/zookeeper-api and helix-core sub-builds of the project still require these libraries.  For Java 11 and beyond, these packages need to be fetched from Maven Central. \r\n\r\nSee the following for more details: http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/320\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nI ran \"mvn test\" on OpenJDK v1.8.0_265 and OpenJDK v11.0.8 on Ubuntu 18.04.  Per the discussion on https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/1319, I ran tests individually (i.e. \"mvn clean install package\") for the following modules:  /helix-core, /zookeeper-api, /helix-rest, /helix-common\r\n\r\nThis is a summary of the results:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/helix-core\r\n- Java 8: OK\r\n[ERROR]   TestDelayedWagedRebalanceWithDisabledInstance.testPartitionMovementAfterDelayTime:82->TestDelayedAutoRebalanceWithDisabledInstance.testPartitionMovementAfterDelayTime:204->ZkTestBase.validateMinActiveAndTopStateReplica:518 Test-DB-createTestDBs0_0 has less active replica 2 then required 3 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\nOK - Ran successfully standalone\r\n[ERROR]   TestJobFailureDependence.testWorkflowFailureJobThreshold ?

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\nHelix Issue 1319: Fix Maven builds failing on on Java 11 and above\r\n\r\nThe helix-zookeeper and helix-core subprojects fail to build on later\r\nversions of Java due to changes in the structure of the JDK starting\r\nin Java 11.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1412\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAs described in the issue, we would like to avoid the scenario where nodes that have been offline for a while come back to life during maintenance mode. Solution: if a node has been offline for a certain period of time, the maintenance mode rebalancer will not assign partitions to it. \r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, two aspects of changes are necessary:\r\n1. A new customer-defined value is required to enable this feature: MAINTENANCE_NODE_TIME_OUT. This value represents \"how long a node has been offline such that it should be timed out\". This value is set in ClusterConfig, similar to DELAY_REBALANCE_TIME.\r\n2. A new logic should be added to the refreshLiveInstances() function of BaseControllerDataProvider. When the maintenance mode is enabled, find the new live nodes, and filter out the timed-out nodes; the timed-out nodes are treated as not live throughout the pipeline. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nEverything under: TestParticipantHistory.java, TestOfflineNodeTimeoutDuringMaintenanceMode.java\r\ntestGetMaintenanceOfflineNodeTimeOut(), testSetMaintenanceOfflineNodeTimeOut()\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[WARNING] Tests run: 1222, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 3,963.658 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[WARNING] Tests run: 1222, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:06 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-10-07T12:10:45-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1408\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nZKDistributedNonblockingLock and its related helix-lock API were not ZooScalability-compliant, meaning they could not be used in a multi-ZK environment. This PR updates the said APIs so that we could use them in multi-ZK environment by adding a Builder that allows users to set multi-ZK parameters.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNo logic change.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nhelix-lock:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.565 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #1397 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn this PR, TestJobTimeout has been stabilized by increasing the job's timeout time. The tasks will be aborted if the job is timing_out and the tasks have already been started. Since 10ms is very short, it is possible that the job goes to a timeout state without tasks being even started on the participant. Hence, a longer timeout time will stabilize the test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1199, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 4,326.057 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1199, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:12 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-09-23T12:57:11-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #1388 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis PR includes pending messages in getCurrentInstanceToTaskAssignments to calculate previously assigned tasks. It would help to avoid duplicate messages being sent to the participant. Also, it would avoid message mismatch messages being sent to the Task Framework pipeline. This PR is necessary to have because pending messages and currentState are located in two different folders.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nTestCurrentInstanceToTaskAssignmentsWithPendingMessage\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestAutoRebalance.testAutoRebalance:184 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1209, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:13 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-09-24T15:25:51-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\nThe failed test individually:\r\nmvn test -Dtest=\"TestAutoRebalance\"\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 8.877 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.rebalancer.TestAutoRebalance\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  14.867 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-09-24T15:31:55-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1382 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCustom rest client interacts with participant side to query for its health checks. Currently there is no metrics for the query requests. We'd like to have metrics for the requests.\r\n\r\nHere's a design trade-off:\r\n\r\n1) Add a new API `getInstanceStoppableCheck(baseUrl, customPayloads, namespace)` in interface `CustomRestClient`. We need the namespace name when recording metrics in `CustomRestClient`. Since CustomRestClient is a singleton instance, we can not inject the namespace to the class. Having the namespace as a parameter in the API is an option. The benefit is we can accurately record the http request latency, and it is more scalable if we have more places calling the API, we don't need to do anything. Cons: change existing interface to add the new API. Though it is an interface, we may not expect external users to use it. So it should be fine to change the interface.\r\n2) Record the metrics in the upstream caller outside `CustomRestClient`, eg.  `InstanceService` where `getInstanceStoppableCheck()` is called, we record the metrics. Pros: we don't need to change existing interface `CustomRestClient`. Cons: Latency of http request is more than the actual number because other stuff like json response parsing is also involved in `CustomRestClient`; and it is not scalable because we have to record metrics in each place where `CustomRestClient. getInstanceStoppableCheck()` is called.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements option 2), because there are not many places that call `CustomRestClient` APIs, and it doesn't look good that pass the namespace as a parameter just for metrics rather than logic related.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"680\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5187721/93721478-6be97a80-fb45-11ea-838f-85851f9088fd.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 168, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 59.766 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 168, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:05 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-09-28T17:43:10-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1378 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nTo enable availability monitoring for helix rest, we want request latency and response metrics. And make sure metrics are not consuming too much memory, we want to categorize the resource methods into \"read\" and \"write\". GET verb is read, and POST, DELETE, UPDATE are writes.\r\n\r\nThis PR only adds `@Timed` and `@ResponseMetered` annotations to each rest method and categorize them \"read\" or \"write\".\r\n\r\nExamples: \r\n<img width=\"575\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5187721/93563544-f6ab5900-f93c-11ea-81a1-3b394ff8dedc.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"515\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5187721/93563678-3a05c780-f93d-11ea-80ed-320ba0b986a5.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nIntegration tests will be added later after we merge the PR #1377 so we can run end to end and test metrics.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nBuild and run tests successfully\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Apache Helix .......................................

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1376 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe need a jmx reporter that is lightweight and easy to use for helix rest. The PR implements a `JmxReporter` class that is based on Dropwizard Metrics lib's [`JmxReporter`](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics/blob/master/metrics-core/src/main/java/io/dropwizard/metrics/JmxReporter.java) class.\r\n\r\nHaving this class in helix gives us flexibility to reduce mbean attributes if we want to, by removing the metric methods in `JmxReporter`.\r\n\r\nSome changes are applied:\r\n* Add `withKeyProperties()` to builder so we can add more key properties to an object name: https://github.com/apache/helix/blob/3299fb4cdf77f62b546e4c33bffd86b5a646cf51/helix-rest/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/rest/metrics/JmxReporter.java#L126-L129\r\n* Remove the `ObjectNameFactory` and put the simple logic to the internal `createName()` and its callers to pass in the parameters.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/blob/3299fb4cdf77f62b546e4c33bffd86b5a646cf51/helix-rest/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/rest/metrics/JmxReporter.java#L713-L714\r\n* Fix and add unit tests\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n* TestJmxReporter\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 175, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 39.013 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 175, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  45.352 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-09-17T21:16:58-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolve #1361\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently we do all the state validation (the from state should be same current state and to state should be different to current state) for state transition message when the message is being executed in HelixStateTransitionHandler.\r\n\r\nWe should move the to state validation to the scheduling stage because of the following reasons:\r\n1. It is a no-op operation, thus we should not create a thread to execute it.\r\n2. The lag between scheduling and executing could add additional latency for controller and eventually application latency.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestStateTransitionHandlerFactory.testStaledMessage\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Results:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \r\n[INFO]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \r\n[ERROR] Failures:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \r\n[ERROR]   TestPauseSignal.testPauseSignal:106 expected:<true> but was:<false>                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \r\n[ERROR]   TestHelixAdminCli.testDeactivateCluster:604 » ZkClient Failed to delete /TestH...                                                                                                                                                                                                            \r\n[INFO]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1213, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \r\n[INFO]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:07 h                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-10-06T21:42:24-07:00                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 10, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 28.41 s -

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1349 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR depends on #1359 , please reviewing that PR first.\r\n\r\nIf no rebalancer class name is specified, use the DelayedAutoRebalancer instead of AutoRebalancer.\r\nNote that DelayedAutoRebalancer is compatible with the AutoRebalanceStrategy. So the assignment would remain the same even after migration.\r\nHowever, since DelayedAutoRebalancer keeps a cached rebalance result in the Controller cache, it causes a behavior change.\r\n- We need to modify multiple test classes to use the CrushEd rebalance strategy for the correct test logic.\r\n- This behavior change only impacts BestPossibleExternalViewVerifier if the resource was on the older AutoRebalancer (by DEFAULT setting) and AutoRebalanceStrategy.\r\n- If any Helix client is using BestPossibleExternalViewVerifier with the described configuration, then changing the rebalancer class config in the IdealState explicitly to AutoRebalancer is required before the Helix version bump-up. Or the BestPossibleExternalViewVerifier may fail.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nMultiple related tests have been updated to cover the new change.\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestP2PNoDuplicatedMessage.testP2PStateTransitionEnabled:174 expected:<2200> but was:<2187>\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1200, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 01:13 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-09-16T00:42:16-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRerun\r\n\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 01:01 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-09-16T11:10:08-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-11T21:06:11Z","updated_at":"2020-09-22T21:30:38Z","closed_at":"2020-09-22T21:30:31Z","merged_at":"2020-09-22T21:30:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"a28a31ebacadc5a6af7afd5e5ea06e9ecc6ce53b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1360/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1360/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1360/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/0414df2afaf9a4dcfca94c83bd50cab6a584fcf3","head":{"label":"jiajunwang:defaultRebalance","ref":"defaultRebalance","sha":"0414df2afaf9a4dcfca94c83bd50cab6a584fcf3","user":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95248544,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTI0ODU0NA==","name":"helix","full_name":"jiajunwang/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1356 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe need helix rest service metrics for each namespace. To achieve this, the namespace info needs to be contained in the MBean's object name, eg: `domain:name=getClusters,namespace=myNamespace,type=counters`. But DropWizard's default ObjectNameFactory doesn't have the namespace parameter.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a custom object name factory and add the namespace to object name.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestHelixRestObjectNameFactory\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 167, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 43.615 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 167, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  49.751 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-09-11T00:08:46-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinal run:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 168, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 39.041 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 168, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  45.121 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-09-21T18:16:05-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1343 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn CallbackHanlder's subscribeForChanges(), children names need to be fetched. subscribeChildChange(path, callbackType) does actually have the children list, but it doesn't return, and later getChildren() is called again. It wastes one zk call: not only wasting time in handling a callback, but also adds more read pressure to zk server.\r\n\r\nWe could use the return result from subscribeChildChange() and save one getChildren() call.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds event types logging and removes two logs. When debugging, we can actually use the event types to determine the code logic. No need to print those two logs, which saves logging overhead when there are intensive callbacks.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testAlgorithmConstructor:127 expected:<9> but was:<6>\r\n[ERROR] org.apache.helix.controller.strategy.crushMapping.TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas(org.apache.helix.controller.strategy.crushMapping.TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2)\r\n[ERROR]   Run 1: TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas:273 Total movements: 4 != expected 8, replica: 1\r\n[ERROR]   Run 2: TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas:273 Total movements: 4 != expected 8, replica: 2\r\n[ERROR]   Run 3: TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas:273 Total movements: 14 != expected 21, replica: 3\r\n[INFO]   Run 4: PASS\r\n[INFO]   Run 5: PASS\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1204, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:12 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-09-24T16:30:00-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 27, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.483 s - in org.apache.helix.controller.strategy.crushMapping.TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 27, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  7.198 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-09-24T17:35:52-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe cluster config null check and instance validation check are tangled together right now. We would like to make them clear and return proper error message to users. Also there are two tests in helix-core and helix-rest with exactly name about instance validation. We want to distinguish them to avoid confusion.\r\nThis PR put cluster config null check into valid instance config check, together with persist intermediate state check. If either of them is false, the instance validation check will fail with a \"false\" return, instead of throwing an exception.\r\nIt also renamed one of the test in `TestInstanceValidationUtil` so that helix-core and helix-rest don't have duplicated test names.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[WARNING] Tests run: 1200, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:10 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-09-02T19:28:18-07:00\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterAccessor.testUpdateConfigFields:167 » IndexOutOfBounds Index: 0, Si...\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 166, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 25\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  33.981 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-09-02T20:01:32-07:00\r\n\r\nThe failed test is a known issue: https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/1336\r\nWill be addressed later.\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFix #1339 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen Helix uses auto registration feature to get VM metadata information from Azure, the name of that VM is in \"name\" field rather than \"vmId\" field. \"vmId\" is more like a serial number, and won't provide much information for users. Details in this page: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/instance-metadata-service\r\nThis PR fixed this issue and also some other minor typos\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n[WARNING] Tests run: 1200, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 4,361.725 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[WARNING] Tests run: 1200, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:12 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-09-02T22:59:41-07:00\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1331 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nPreFetch annotation in class CallbackHandler is using `org.apache.helix.api.listeners.PreFetch`.\r\nThen when it is disabled, the value is not honor in ZkClient. So ZkClient still prefetches the data for callback handler. Because in ZkClient, the annotation org.apache.helix.zookeeper.zkclient.annotation.PreFetch is used.\r\n\r\nThis PR also changes the existing annotation in zookeeper-api `org.apache.helix.zookeeper.zkclient.annotation.PreFetch` is proposed to `org.apache.helix.zookeeper.zkclient.annotation.PreFetchChangedData`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n- TestPrefetchChangedData\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1200, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 4,750.436 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testQueueParallelJobs(org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestEnqueueJobs)  Time elapsed: 300.013 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\norg.testng.internal.thread.ThreadTimeoutException: Method org.testng.internal.TestNGMethod.testQueueParallelJobs() didn't finish within the time-out 300000\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestEnqueueJobs.testQueueParallelJobs » ThreadTimeout Method org.testng.intern...\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1200, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:19 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-08-31T17:33:39-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #972, #1008, #1010 Fixes #1320 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nNew feature: task framework now allows task thread pools to have configurable sizes. Users can specify target task pool sizes on either the cluster-level or on the instance-level by setting either GLOBAL_TARGET_TASK_THREAD_POOL_SIZE in ClusterConfig or TARGET_TASK_THREAD_POOL_SIZE in InstanceConfig. This specification propagates downwards, where instance-level configs overwrite the cluster-level configs, and not specifying a value on either level defaults to the old static value of 40 - this also makes this feature backward compatible. After JVM restart, an instance will have a pool with the specified size for task threads. \r\n\r\nThis is a combination PR of #973, #1009, #1011, #1327. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestParticipantManager.testCurrentTaskThreadPoolSizeCreation, TestClusterConfig.testGetGlobalTargetTaskThreadPoolSize, TestClusterConfig.testSetGlobalTargetTaskThreadPoolSize, TestClusterConfig.testSetGlobalTargetTaskThreadPoolSizeIllegalArgument, TestInstanceConfig.testGetTargetTaskThreadPoolSize, TestInstanceConfig.testSetTargetTaskThreadPoolSize, TestInstanceConfig.testSetTargetTaskThreadPoolSizeIllegalArgument, (TestZKLiveInstanceData renamed to TestLiveInstance)TestLiveInstance.testGetCurrentTaskThreadPoolSize, TestLiveInstance.testGetCurrentTaskThreadPoolSizeDefault, TestLiveInstance.testSetCurrentTaskThreadPoolSize, TestTaskDriver, TestTaskStateModelFactory, TestTaskUtil.testGetTaskThreadPoolSize, TestTaskUtil.testGetTaskThreadPoolSizeInstanceConfigUndefined, TestTaskUtil.testGetTaskThreadPoolSizeInstanceConfigDoesNotExist, TestTaskUtil.testGetTaskThreadPoolSizeClusterConfigUndefined, TestTaskUtil.testGetTaskThreadPoolSizeClusterConfigDoesNotExist\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1199, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 4,251.44 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testEnableCompressionResource(org.apache.helix.integration.TestEnableCompression)  Time elapsed: 142.226 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource(TestEnableCompression.java:117)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] testPeriodicRefresh(org.apache.helix.integration.spectator.TestRoutingTableProviderPeriodicRefresh)  Time elapsed: 2.017 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<4> but was:<3>\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.spectator.TestRoutingTableProviderPeriodicRefresh.testPeriodicRefresh(TestRoutingTableProviderPeriodicRefresh.java:211)\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource:117 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestRoutingTableProviderPeriodicRefresh.testPeriodicRefresh:211 expected:<4> but was:<3>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1199, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:11 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-08-28T10:58:35-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\nRerun\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 29.928 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  35.399 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-08-28T11:40:53-07:00\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolve #1321 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nDue to #526, currently we have random sleep() in the test before verifyByPolling(). \r\nThis cause test failure in different environment. Here we enhance ZKHelixVerifier\r\nfamily with an option in builder to add a waiting period. To keep it backward \r\ncompatible, without enable this waiting option, the code would behave exactly the\r\nsame as before.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNone\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nRunning \r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe setters were not actually setting the InstanceConfig/ClusterConfig.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1323, #1324\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR removes IdealState usage from the task framework pipeline. Instead, now workflow resources are created directly using WorkflowConfig and JobConfig. As a result, the legacy pipeline logic in TaskSchedulingStage is removed: it was there for the case of \"IdealState exists but not WorkflowConfig\", which is no longer possible now. \r\n\r\nAfter the removal of legacy pipeline logic, numerous unintended usage of the legacy pipeline were uncovered in the form of broken tests; these tests are addressed and fixed. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, 2 bugs in the pipeline were also uncovered and fixed: the first one is about tasks being incorrectly rejected; the second one is about negative scheduling delay not properly rejected. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1173, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 4,390.976 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testEnableCompressionResource(org.apache.helix.integration.TestEnableCompression)  Time elapsed: 149.639 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource(TestEnableCompression.java:117)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] testStateTransitionTimeOut(org.apache.helix.integration.paticipant.TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource)  Time elapsed: 7.422 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.paticipant.TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.verify(TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.java:209)\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.paticipant.TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.lambda$testStateTransitionTimeOut$0(TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.java:173)\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.paticipant.TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.testStateTransitionTimeOut(TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.java:173)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] testPeriodicRefresh(org.apache.helix.integration.spectator.TestRoutingTableProviderPeriodicRefresh)  Time elapsed: 2.011 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<4> but was:<3>\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.spectator.TestRoutingTableProviderPeriodicRefresh.testPeriodicRefresh(TestRoutingTableProviderPeriodicRefresh.java:211)\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource:117 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.testStateTransitionTimeOut:173->lambda$testStateTransitionTimeOut$0:173->verify:209 NullPointer\r\n[ERROR]   TestRoutingTableProviderPeriodicRefresh.testPeriodicRefresh:211 expected:<4> but was:<3>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1173, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:13 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-09-14T13:33:37-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\nRerun\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 49.247 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  54.713 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-09-14T14:18:32-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/wiki/Task-Framework-IdealState-Dependency-Removal-Progression\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a cluster topology using a trie. The trie is constructed in a way that each non end node represents a domain, and each end node represents an instance. This data structure could help retrieve the topology under any given domain efficiently. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestTrieClusterTopology.java\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nhelix-core:\r\n[WARNING] Tests run: 1206, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 3,971.319 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[WARNING] Tests run: 1206, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:06 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-09-23T23:08:37-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nhelix-rest:\r\nknown issue: https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/1336\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterAccessor.testUpdateConfigFields:167 » IndexOutOfBounds Index: 0, Si...\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 168, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 25\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  31.376 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-09-23T23:49:39-07:00\r\n\r\n(Before CI test pass, please copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\")\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-24T17:52:05Z","updated_at":"2021-06-04T05:42:56Z","closed_at":"2020-09-24T18:38:52Z","merged_at":"2020-09-24T18:38:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"d9a487731746394ae8aa53b0d1ee7e8bf79fd85b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1307/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1307/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1307/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/d6c6aafeabc55f5cd710721249177d11e3c4283d","head":{"label":"zhangmeng916:master","ref":"master","sha":"d6c6aafeabc55f5cd710721249177d11e3c4283d","user":{"login":"zhangmeng916","id":56051770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDUxNzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56051770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangmeng916","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":212211389,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTIyMTEzODk=","name":"helix","full_name":"zhangmeng916/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhangmeng916","id":56051770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDUxNzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56051770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangmeng916","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangmeng916/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhangmeng916/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nResolve  #401 \r\nFix #1291 (Step-1)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe controller switch time for large scale cluster is slow. It takes around ~60s for a standby controller to obtain leadership of a cluster with ~50 participants and ~700 resources. The service's availability is impacted under this period of time.\r\nIn our performance profile, it shows that org.apache.helix.zookeeper.datamodel.serializer.ZNRecordSerializer.deserialize took ~60% of the time for org.apache.helix.manager.zk.DistributedLeaderElection.onControllerChange. Replace org.codehaus.jackson with FasterXML.jackson will reduce 60% of the total time spend. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Failures:                                                                                                                                                                 \r\n[ERROR]   TestCustomizedViewAggregation.testCustomizedViewAggregation:413->validateAggregationSnapshot:257 expected:<true> but was:<false>                                        \r\n[INFO]                                                                                                                                                                            \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1173, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1                                                                                                                       \r\n[INFO]  \r\n\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 6.789 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.TestCustomizedViewAggregation\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-19T20:49:15Z","updated_at":"2020-08-21T02:06:10Z","closed_at":"2020-08-21T02:06:10Z","merged_at":"2020-08-21T02:06:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"cd552d9f122dbe3fa4b3648d38b2fc615f663b84","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1293/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1293/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1293/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/d09d855d36740c7d360374ddf3be4fb72ea55ff1","head":{"label":"xyuanlu:wipPerf","ref":"wipPerf","sha":"d09d855d36740c7d360374ddf3be4fb72ea55ff1","user":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260321741,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAzMjE3NDE=","name":"helix","full_name":"xyuanlu/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixed #1260  \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe previous test testAutoRegistrationShouldFailWhenWaitingRespons in TestInstanceAutoJoin will fail in github test, although it always pass locally. The reason is that the test was written with the assumption that it is only run in on-prem environment and auto registration will fail with no cloud response returned. However, github tests are run in cloud environment, and the auto registration will succeed. This PR changed the test to make it adapt to both on-prem and cloud environment. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1255 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR extends the scope of the non-trimmable elements that are defined in the ResourceChangeDetector. With this change, any key changes in the Map fields or List fields won't be ignored by the change detector. Instead of just fixing the issue that modifying the IS preference list does not trigger automatic rebalance, this change will also help to prevent other potential bugs with the same root cause.\r\n\r\nNote this change might increase the rebalancer running in some circumstances. However, given a very explicit allowlist (or blocklist) in the change detector is very expensive to maintain, the current solution trades off the potential performance impact for simplicity.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nModified the related tests:\r\n1. TestWagedRebalancer.testRebalanceOnChanges\r\n2. TestHelixPropoertyTimmer\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1163, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 4,626.399 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1163, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 01:17 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-08-12T00:29:45-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nDifferent mvn versions may have different test running order.\r\nIf testCurrentStatesSelectiveUpdate is run before the other tests in TestRoutingDataCache, the later tests may fail. This PR fixes the test by adding a new participant to cluster and dropping the participant, verifying cluster state after the test.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(Before CI test pass, please copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\")\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1230 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n- A new field is added to JobConfig in order to support terminal state job purging: TerminalStateExpiry. Necessary functions are implemented to support the new field. \r\n- A new set of logic is added to TaskGarbageCollectionStage. When purging jobs, terminal state jobs will be considered based on the new expiry value. In addition, a \"failed job propagation\" logic is put in place. This accounts for the jobs that fail due to parental job failures, because these jobs would not have JobContexts, preventing them to be purged through normal means; with the propagation logic they can be purged along with the failed parental jobs. \r\n- Modify scheduleJobCleanUp usage to correctly reflect the expiry used. The previous code wasn't necessary as FAILED jobs were not cleaned up anyways, but now it has a meaning. \r\n- Modify jobDispatcher to honor TIMED_OUT job states. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\ntestJobQueueFailedCleanUp, testJobQueueTimedOutCleanUp, testGetExpiredJobsFromCacheFailPropagation\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1169, Failures: 5, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 4,517.039 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testResourceSubset(org.apache.helix.tools.TestClusterStateVerifier)  Time elapsed: 1.028 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\norg.apache.helix.HelixException: Failed to create pause signal\r\n        at org.apache.helix.tools.TestClusterStateVerifier.testResourceSubset(TestClusterStateVerifier.java:115)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] afterMethod(org.apache.helix.tools.TestClusterStateVerifier)  Time elapsed: 1.064 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: ZkClient already closed!\r\n        at org.apache.helix.tools.TestClusterStateVerifier.afterMethod(TestClusterStateVerifier.java:98)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] TestMessageSimpleSendReceiveAsync(org.apache.helix.integration.messaging.TestCrossClusterMessagingService)  Time elapsed: 2.118 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: \r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.messaging.TestCrossClusterMessagingService.TestMessageSimpleSendReceiveAsync(TestCrossClusterMessagingService.java:145)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] testEnableCompressionResource(org.apache.helix.integration.TestEnableCompression)  Time elapsed: 168.201 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource(TestEnableCompression.java:117)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] testStateTransitionTimeOut(org.apache.helix.integration.paticipant.TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource)  Time elapsed: 36.072 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.paticipant.TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.testStateTransitionTimeOut(TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.java:171)\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource:117 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestCrossClusterMessagingService.TestMessageSimpleSendReceiveAsync:145\r\n[ERROR]   TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.testStateTransitionTimeOut:171 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterStateVerifier.afterMethod:98 » IllegalState ZkClient already closed...\r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterStateVerifier.testResourceSubset:115 » Helix Failed to create pause...\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1169, Failures: 5, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:15 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-08-13T13:11:21-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nRerun\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 11, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 77.624 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] afterMethod(org.apache.helix.tools.TestClusterStateVerifier)  Time elapsed: 1.13 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: ZkClient already closed!\r\n        at org.apache.helix.tools.TestClusterStateVerifier.afterMethod(TestClusterStateVerifier.java:98)\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterStateVerifier.afterMethod:98 » IllegalState ZkClient already closed...\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 11, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:22 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-08-13T14:10:06-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nRerun\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 9.392 s - in org.apache.helix.tools.TestClusterStateVerifier\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  14.566 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-08-13T14:12:20-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-07T17:07:45Z","updated_at":"2020-08-13T23:45:34Z","closed_at":"2020-08-13T23:45:33Z","merged_at":"2020-08-13T23:45:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"e163efc4de07a67069fdbd4effd19729158fa832","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1231/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1231/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1231/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/60f08cf84baf4d10abe573b7644820494b7d7ed9","head":{"label":"NealSun96:nealsun/terminal-job-purging","ref":"nealsun/terminal-job-purging","sha":"60f08cf84baf4d10abe573b7644820494b7d7ed9","user":{"login":"NealSun96","id":18000949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAwOTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18000949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96","html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":233725825,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzM3MjU4MjU=","name":"helix","full_name":"NealSun96/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NealSun96","id":18000949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAwOTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18000949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96","html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1198 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThere are duplicate classes at runtime since 1.0+, because of the module separation. Two different JARs contain the same package but with different contents. Eg, both helix-core.jar and metrics-common.jar contains SensorNameProvider.class. And at tests runtime, we have a check to detect duplicate classes and this causes tests failure.\r\n\r\nThough helix doesn't have duplicate classes in the same package, it is still not a good practice to package the same class into two different jars that have dependency relation.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to clean up the duplicate classes. And small refactoring work is needed to fix this issue, so with these different package paths, we could cleanly avoid exporting classes of metrics-common to helix-core.jar.\r\n\r\n**Refactor change**:\r\nDedicated path for metrics-common: org.apache.helix.monitoring.XXX -> org.apache.helix.monitoring.**common**.XXX\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5187721/89080252-3bebdb00-d33d-11ea-93a9-4d6f8e5a4b6e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(Copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\")\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#1189\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAdd a new Helix rest API in the ZookeeperAccessor for deleting an ephemeral ZNode.\r\n\r\nNote that before we have ACL/audit support in the Helix rest, allowing raw ZK write operation is dangerous.\r\nThis API is introduced prematurely for resolving the issue of \"zombie\" participant (the instance has an active zk connection, but refuse to do any work). Currently, the existence of such a node may block the normal state transitions and then impact the cluster's availability. This PR restricts that only an ephemeral node can be deleted to minimize the risk.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestZooKeeperAccessor.testDelete()\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nhelix-rest\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 164, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 49.55 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 164, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 55.836 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-07-30T15:40:28-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the
